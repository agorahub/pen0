How could AI transform the art form?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)’s “visit piece” is one of the intelligence community’s secret weapons.&lt;/strong&gt; By revealing what foreign leaders want and analyzing their personality, the CIA delivers decision advantage when the U.S. president is meeting with an African counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The CIA expertly assessed how African leaders sought to navigate geopolitical competition during the Cold War,&lt;/strong&gt; and it succeeded in deciphering what underpinned specific attitudes toward engagement with U.S. presidents, judging from a review of declassified intelligence assessments, policy memos, public statements, and press reports from 1961–1987.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The art of leadership analysis is ripe for innovation, driven by artificial intelligence (AI),&lt;/strong&gt; following six decades of impressive support to U.S. presidents. The current AI models are underwhelming, however; they will require significant training and iteration, as well as a proficiency with the art form, to strengthen and enrich analysis on leaders in Africa and other global regions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When President Joe Biden welcomes foreign leaders to Washington, he is inundated with paper. From talking points and draft statements to seating arrangements and dinner menus, the White House staff will prepare all of it, except for one essential document: the CIA leadership visit piece. It is this analysis — presented as a standalone assessment or integrated into the President’s Daily Brief (PDB) — that delivers decision advantage for the president of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A CIA visit piece is more than a written recitation of a foreign leader’s career highlights or a preview of potential agenda items. When it is done well, it is a revealing and yet remarkably succinct study on a leader’s hopes and dreams, attitudes and demeanor, and friends and enemies at home and abroad. In other words, it is a roadmap to understand who is sitting across the table and how to advance U.S. national security interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effective leadership analysis is exceedingly difficult to do in the best of circumstances, and arguably even more challenging when it comes to sub-Saharan Africa. Relative to other regions, there has been less reporting, comparatively fewer intelligence analysts, and a limited number of senior policy interactions. It requires deep subject-matter expertise and superior intelligence tradecraft to transcend these shortcomings and contribute to a successful presidential engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The declassified record, while incomplete and riddled with redactions, showcases how and why CIA leadership analysis has become pivotal to presidential meetings. By examining 34 PDBs and other intelligence reports from 1961 to 1987 and then cross-referencing these analytic assessments with 63 policy memos, public statements, and press reports, as well as personal reflections, it is possible to chart how the CIA perfected the visit piece; measure its policy successes and failures; and point to new innovations to elevate the art form, including through the transformative power of AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;creating-the-visit-piece&quot;&gt;Creating the Visit Piece&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the spring of 1961, President John F. Kennedy, still reeling from the Bay of Pigs crisis, expressed his dissatisfaction with his intelligence support. His staff piled on, complaining about the daily stream of reports from multiple government agencies and the dense, often inscrutable bureaucratic jargon. The CIA, in response, rushed to create the President’s Intelligence Checklist (the predecessor of the PDB) to address Kennedy’s concerns. With crisp prose and a global perspective, it became an immediate hit. The president not only relied on the product to inform policy decisions, but it also served him well in his meetings with foreign leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kennedy believed in the power of personal diplomacy, especially with regards to Africa. He told his staff that he wanted to engage with his African counterparts, decreeing that “if African leaders want to meet me, good. Invite them down here.” Kennedy’s interest and appetite for information about the continent was considerable; Arthur Schlesinger, one of Kennedy’s closest advisers, recalled that some African leaders told him that the “American president knew more about their countries than they did themselves.” Three months after the creation of the President’s Intelligence Checklist, Kennedy received a CIA assessment regarding Sudanese general Ibrahim Abboud’s state visit. Abboud, who the analysts judged to be a “sincere patriot, disgusted by the corruption among the civilians,” was seeking to secure from Kennedy “some sort of dramatic impact project” to increase his prestige.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “visit piece,” however, was hardly a developed art form, and it struggled to distinguish itself from traditional political analysis. In this early period, most assessments included a cursory reference to a leader’s planned travel to Washington before segueing into more standard assessments on the country’s political, economic, and security developments. While some exceptions exist (including an astute study on a “more self-assured” Zairian president Mobutu Sese Seko in 1973), the visit piece, as it related to African heads of state, was fairly mundane and not consistently crafted to advance a presidential meeting. Judging from the declassified record, the art form only started to find its stride during the Carter administration and reached its apogee under President Ronald Reagan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Jimmy Carter regarded the CIA’s leadership analysis as vital to his diplomacy, especially his landmark summit with Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian president Anwar Sadat in 1978. He told CIA analysts that he wanted to be “steeped in the personalities of Begin and Sadat.” These psychological profiles enabled Carter to navigate negotiations between the two leaders; in 2013, he admitted that the CIA assessments had “steeled his resolve to seek a full-fledged treaty between Egypt and Israel.” It stands to reason that this diplomatic triumph at Camp David reaffirmed the importance of leadership profiles and visit pieces. Carter, who boasted that he was more interested in Africa than his predecessors and spent “more effort and worry on Rhodesia than the Middle East,” presumably demanded similarly rigorous analysis to inform his interactions with African leaders. While still uneven as an art form, the CIA’s 1978 assessment on Senegalese president Leopold Senghor, who possessed “an impressive blend of intellectual and political skills” and “moves as gracefully and comfortably in French culture as he does in African,” was a significant improvement in analytic quality and insights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The visit piece reached new heights during the Reagan administration. Indeed, the CIA started to regularly label these assessments as such; 13 out of the 19 declassified analytic reports published to coincide with Reagan’s meetings with African counterparts included the word “visit” in the title. The art form’s growing prominence reflected Reagan’s interest in people. His national security adviser, Bud McFarlane, said Reagan “always focused on the human dimension of foreign policy, waiting to know more about everybody.” The increase in the quality of visit pieces also probably stemmed from Reagan’s engagement on Africa. He met with more African leaders than any of his predecessors, and his policies to eject the Cubans from Angola and secure Namibian independence, as well as his antipathy toward Libyan leader Muammar Qadhafi’s adventurism in the region, framed many of his interactions with African counterparts. The CIA rose to the challenge, leveraging its expertise and tradecraft to ensure the president had the most critical analysis to charm, coax, and cajole his White House visitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;serving-the-president&quot;&gt;Serving the President&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CIA’s visit piece, when at its best, consists of five elements. It delves into a leader’s personality, their goals, and the context for the meeting — specifically the country’s political, economic, and security situation. It also includes a warning component, informing the president that his counterpart may criticize U.S. policy or press for a change to the U.S. approach. Finally, it often features an outlook section, forecasting whether a leader or his country will succumb to or overcome emerging challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personality:&lt;/strong&gt; A visit piece’s most critical task is revealing a leader’s personality: not what they have done, but who they are. The study of an African leader’s disposition, temperament, and personal history helps to explain what makes them tick. It is fundamental to a visit piece, and it is certainly the hardest for intelligence analysts to master. The declassified assessments, for example, stressed Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie’s “unusual personal vigor and determination” and Zambian president Kenneth Kaunda’s tendency to become “highly emotional.” They characterized Sudanese leader Jafaar Nimeiri as “low-key, unpretentious” and explained that Mozambican president Samora Machel was “given to dominating conversation.” The most exceptional pieces tapped into a leader’s mindset; in 1973, for example, CIA analysts asserted that “as Mobutu’s confidence has grown, so have his pretensions to leadership in Africa.” At the same time, they judged that he “remains troubled . . . by the picture many have of him as being overly pro-US.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goals:&lt;/strong&gt; A visit piece uncovers what an African leader wants from his interactions with the U.S. president. While a predictable feature of the art form, it takes talent and experience to go beyond the obvious. The declassified record is full of intelligence assessments that highlighted potential requests for more financial or military assistance, or a desire “to improve his stature at home,” as was the case for President Quett Masire of Botswana in 1984. More impactful have been visit pieces that unearthed broader foreign policy priorities, such as Senghor’s likely requests for U.S. funding in support of Angolan rebel Jonas Savimbi or Ivorian president Felix Houphouet-Boigny’s hope for “assurances that the US remains committed to protecting its friends in the Third World.” The most sophisticated pieces raised potential quid pro quos; in 1985, the CIA suggested that in return for more U.S. assistance, Machel may accept a symbolic U.S. naval visit to Maputo, the addition of a defense attaché to the U.S. embassy, and more balanced voting by Maputo’s representative at the United Nations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Context:&lt;/strong&gt; A CIA visit piece also analyzes the political, security, and economic context underpinning a presidential meeting. It explains what is driving a leader’s actions and any potential asks of the U.S. government. Houphouet, for example, was concerned about “the crumbling institutions of the states around him,” and Senghor was animated by a “fear of Soviet intervention in Africa and elsewhere.” Visit pieces often underline a leader’s expectations, such as Kenyan president Daniel Arap Moi’s belief that his acceptance of a military access agreement obliged the United States to help Kenya. The assessments also touch on an African leader’s opinion of U.S. allies and adversaries, such as Senegalese president Abdou Diouf’s criticisms of French president Francois Mitterrand’s Africa policies or Zimbabwean prime minister Robert Mugabe’s close relations with Yugoslavia, Romania, Bulgaria, North Korea, and China. Several assessments in the declassified record explained why the Soviet Union valued its partnerships with African leaders, such as Somalia’s Mohamed Siad Barre in 1970s. The rare visit piece even called out when a leader was being disingenuous. In 1983, the CIA pointed out that Kaunda’s insistence that he pursued a balanced foreign policy was “only partly valid.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning:&lt;/strong&gt; An effective visit piece also prepares the U.S. president for difficult conversations, identifying areas of disagreement and steering them away from counterproductive topics. The CIA profile generally incorporates several red flags and “watch out fors” into its analysis, such as highlighting that Sudan’s Abboud “has been critical of the level of American aid” and that Senghor’s policies on Arab-Israeli issues “conflict with US interests.” In 1982, the CIA warned that Liberian leader Samuel Doe’s frustrations with the economy posed “the most serious potential irritant to Liberian-US relations.” The visit piece on Mugabe’s 1983 meeting with Reagan was forthright about potential landmines, noting that Mugabe “resents Western criticism of his efforts to quell dissident violence” and that he is “extremely sensitive to any actions by Washington that he believes infringe on Zimbabwe’s sovereignty.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outlook:&lt;/strong&gt; A visit piece usually includes an outlook section, forecasting what the future may hold for a leader or country and what that could portend for U.S. interests. It may be as routine as predicting another election win for Kenya’s Moi or asserting that Nigerian leader Ibrahim Babangida’s “prospects for remaining in office over at least the next year or so appear favorable.” Some assessments addressed a pending leadership transition, concluding that a successor to Senghor “probably will continue to follow moderate, democratic principles.” The analysis, however, has historically tended to skew negative, such as the CIA’s judgment in 1962 that Ugandan prime minister Milton Obote may gradually adopt some anti-Western sentiment or the risk of growing regional and ethnic tensions in Cameroon and Togo. In 1969, the CIA painted a grim picture of Haile Selassie’s grip on power, arguing that his reforms paradoxically undercut his control and “unhappiness with his autocratic rule will likely continue to grow and nurture serious and perhaps successful plotting.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;grading-the-analysis&quot;&gt;Grading the Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A visit piece, regardless of how well written and considered, is only as valuable as it is convincing to the reader and adept at shaping the president’s conversations as well as contributing to favorable outcomes. While the CIA’s initial forays into visit pieces were occasionally outmatched by Department of State and National Security Council memos, the declassified record reveals some impressive results. President Richard Nixon and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger took onboard the CIA’s message that Mobutu wanted to strike a balance between being viewed as independent while remaining “on good terms with the US.” In their meeting, Kissinger praised the Zairian leader’s UN speech as a masterpiece because it sounded “critical of the United States, but when one read it, it was not so bad.” Nixon added that the speech showed that Mobutu was a “skillful politician.” The analysis on Senghor was prescient that the Senegalese leader fancied himself a mediator. He informed President Carter that “he is part Jewish and can speak frankly to both sides” of the Arab-Israeli question. The CIA also accurately pinpointed Liberian leader Doe’s need for continued U.S. support to shore up his shaky regime. In press remarks following his White House visit, Doe exclaimed that “President Reagan assured me we can continue to count on America’s understanding and support.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CIA particularly excelled at framing why African leaders viewed themselves as non-aligned and how navigating global geopolitical competition was central to their foreign policies. Following his engagement with Abboud, Kennedy publicly confirmed that the United States “fully endorsed the determination of the newly-independent countries of Africa to maintain their independence.” In press interviews during his visit to Washington in 1985, Mozambique’s Machel was adamant that his country was “African, independent, and nonaligned,” adding that “there is no question of blocs.” Reagan seemingly reached a similar conclusion, writing in his diary that Machel “turned out to be quite a guy and I believe he really intends to be ‘non-alligned’ [sic] instead of a Soviet patsy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The visit pieces had mixed results when anticipating an African leader’s key priorities or potential issues to discuss. The CIA published a long paper on Liberia’s economy ahead of President William Tubman’s meeting with President Lyndon Johnson, accurately previewing the Liberian leader’s deep concern with his country’s pressing foreign debt service and rising commodity prices. Tubman and Johnson subsequently dedicated several paragraphs to Liberia’s economic challenges in their joint statement. Similarly, several of the CIA visit pieces accurately captured how many West African leaders had become apprehensive about Libyan meddling in the region, especially in Chad. After his meeting with Reagan in 1983, Senegal’s Diouf told the Washington Post that “we must stop the Chadian adventure.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the CIA repeatedly failed to identify global issues that the African leaders discussed in their engagements with U.S. presidents, including the situation in Berlin in the 1960s or Lebanon in the 1980s. The agency’s obsession with Upper Volta (now Burkina Faso) leader Thomas Sankara — they saw Libya’s hand behind his coup in 1983 — prompted analysts to repeatedly flag the country as a likely topic in visit pieces on Senegal’s Diouf and Togo’s Gnassingbe Eyadema; Upper Volta, however, was absent in any of the public statements, press reports, diary entries, or the memorandum of conversation from Eyadema’s meeting with Reagan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The visit pieces had some other big misses. Ahead of Nimeiri’s meetings with Reagan in late 1983, the CIA raised concerns about the Sudanese leader’s “erratic personal behavior,” warning that his decision to introduce sharia law had alarmed the country’s leftists, secular elite, and predominately non-Muslim southerners. Despite the agency’s growing worry that Nimeiri was vulnerable to a coup, Reagan seemed unconvinced and sidestepped any questions about the Sudanese regime’s increasing fragility; Nimeiri was eventually removed from power by a popular uprising some 16 months later. Moreover, the visit piece in the 1980s failed in one fundamental aspect: they did not fully understand their customer. In his diaries, Reagan repeatedly opined on whether an African leader was a believer in “free enterprise,” whereas only the profile on Houphouet examined the Ivorian president’s economic philosophy. A central precept of leadership analysis is knowing your principal’s interests, which the CIA seemed to have flubbed during the Reagan administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;profiling-for-the-future&quot;&gt;Profiling for the Future&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When future African leaders visit the White House, President Biden almost certainly will benefit from the CIA’s insights on the leaders’ political acumen, as well as their top concerns for their country’s economy or security, or their views on global crises. The visit piece, after more than six decades of evolution and refinement, has become a vital resource for U.S. presidents, and it will undoubtedly serve President Biden well in his next engagements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the art form seems ripe for another innovation — this one powered by the generative power of AI. The drafting of leadership profiles and assessments are innately human endeavors, but AI has the potential to augment and enhance this critical intelligence product. In last year’s National Intelligence Strategy, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines committed to strengthening the intelligence’s community’s capabilities in language, technical, and cultural expertise harnessing open-source “big data,” AI, and advanced analytics. Below are three recommendations on how to leverage AI in the analysis of African leaders, as well as other prominent global figures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scale:&lt;/strong&gt; The drafting of a leadership assessment is a time-intensive effort, requiring deep substantive expertise and a mastery of analytic tradecraft. While analysts focus on the visiting African leader, AI can generate additional profiles on the entire delegation, adding further value to the engagement. This is more than a just force multiplier; it is crucial for policy success. In the CIA’s piece on Zambian president Kaunda’s visit, the analysts highlighted the participation of Reuben Kamanga, the ruling party’s top foreign affairs specialist, who was instrumental in repairing relations between the United States and Zambia. In contrast, the CIA failed to mention Cape Verde’s foreign minister — who Reagan disliked, according to his subsequent diary entry — in its visit piece on President Aristides Pereira in 1983.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Customization:&lt;/strong&gt; A visit piece is typically directed toward the U.S. president and later distributed to other senior policymakers. While the analysis for the president addresses strategic topics, it often excludes details useful for subsequent meetings and engagements with U.S. officials. By leveraging AI, it is possible to generate tailored analyses to plug into existing assessments for additional readers. For example, the CIA only briefly discussed the cocoa market in its visit piece on Houphouet in 1983, whereas the Department of State dedicated several sections to the topic in its own memorandum. With AI’s assistance, a leadership profile could have multiple bespoke versions to better align with diverse U.S. policy needs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Analytics:&lt;/strong&gt; Leadership profiles, as is the case for other intelligence assessments, use all-source information to back up analytic judgments. This art form, however, rarely avails itself of big data to strengthen its argumentation. AI’s capacity to identify common themes and patterns in the underlying data and quickly summarize large amounts of text could help analysts to quantify some of their work. For instance, the CIA explained in 1973 that Ethiopia’s “budget suggests that they may be less worried than they say” about the threat from Somalia. By tapping into AI, the visit piece could have included a deeper analysis of the budget to contrast the emperor’s stated priorities with his government’s current actions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;ais-lackluster-take-on-president-rutos-visit&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AI’s Lackluster Take on President Ruto’s Visit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The existing AI models remain underwhelming when generating leadership profiles and integrating the best standards of analytic tradecraft. It will require significant AI model training and iteration, as well as a proficiency with the art form, to raise the current AI level to something that will strengthen and enrich intelligence products. For example, when the leading chatbots were asked what Kenyan president William Ruto might raise with President Biden during their meeting on May 23, the answers ranged from unexceptional to unacceptable:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ChatGPT 4 offered the most fulsome take, indicating that “Ruto views this as an opportunity to usher in a new era of dynamic partnerships, particularly in transforming trade and investment, green energy, digital technology, and multilateralism, aiming for shared prosperity not only for Kenya and the United States but globally.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Anthropic’s Claude generated a passable answer, identifying five potential topics, including “strengthening economic and trade ties between the two countries, possibly discussing the proposed U.S.-Kenya free trade agreement that was being negotiated,” and “security cooperation, given Kenya’s role in fighting terrorist groups like al-Shabab in East Africa.” The only problem, however, is that there is no free trade agreement currently under discussion.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Meta AI spun out a very basic response, generating a list of 11 topics Ruto could possibly raise, such as expanding economic ties, strengthening people-to-people ties, furthering technological innovation, and addressing climate and clean energy.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Google’s Gemini failed the exercise entirely, acknowledging that it was “still learning how to answer this question” and recommended trying Google Search.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;國安警供述替陳梓華錄口供過程&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;壹傳媒創辦人黎智英與《蘋果日報》3間相關公司，被控「串謀勾結外國勢力」等罪，案件周五（17日）在西九龍裁判法院（暫代高等法院）展開第78日審訊，國安警在辯方盤問下，講述到羈押中心，替陳梓華錄取口供的過程。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件由高院《國安法》指定法官杜麗冰、李素蘭及李運騰審理。控方由副刑事檢控專員周天行、助理刑事檢控專員張卓勤、高級檢控官陳穎琛代表；黎智英由資深大律師彭耀鴻、大律師關文渭及有香港執業資格的新西蘭御用大律師 Marc Corlett 代表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1004-開庭&quot;&gt;1004 開庭&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1008-國安警供述替陳梓華錄口供過程&quot;&gt;10:08 國安警供述替陳梓華錄口供過程&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;國安警黎國勇繼續作供，辯方續圍繞黎探訪陳梓華的情況提問，辯方早前指，2022年8月至11月9日期間，黎探訪陳14次；黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方針對11月9日的探訪提問，指根據黎的記事冊，提及翌日早上10時，警長1237離開基地前往羈押中心進行調查。辯方又展示由警長1237撰寫的調查報告，黎引述指，於當天11時至下午3時45分，黎與警長1237於羈押中心會見室與陳梓華會面，並由警長1237向其錄取口供，共6頁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在庭上補充，當天他與警長1237前往會見室，因被指派要向陳錄取口供，由警長1237負責。黎再向懲教署職員協調，安排如何列印口供予陳梓華簽署。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1250-辯方正向懲教署申請張劍虹探訪紀錄&quot;&gt;12:50 辯方：正向懲教署申請張劍虹探訪紀錄&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方提及，正向懲教署申請張劍虹的探訪紀錄，希望稍後就此向黎提問。法官杜麗冰質疑，辯方提問無助於辯方案情，指除非辯方指控在證人錄取口供的過程中，遭受威逼而捏造證供，否則即使證人曾與警方談及證供，亦無助於辯方案情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;國安警曾與下屬到羈押中心替陳梓華錄口供&quot;&gt;國安警：曾與下屬到羈押中心替陳梓華錄口供&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方代表大律師關文渭續圍繞國安警黎國勇探訪陳梓華的情況提問，黎早前確認，2022年8月至11月9日期間，黎探訪陳14次。辯方針對11月9日的探訪提問，顯示當中黎的記事冊記項，包括當天10點前往羈押中心進行調查。辯方續指，根據黎的記事冊，提及翌日早上10時，警長1237離開基地前往羈押中心進行調查。辯方又展示由警長1237撰寫的調查報告，黎引述指，於當天11時至下午3時45分，黎與警長1237於羈押中心會見室與陳梓華會面，並由警長1237向其錄取口供，共6頁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在庭上補充，當天他與警長1237前往會見室，因被指派要向陳錄取口供，由警長1237負責。黎再向懲教署職員協調，安排如何列印口供予陳梓華簽署。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在黎國勇避席下，辯方另提及，正向懲教署申請張劍虹的探訪紀錄，希望稍後就此向黎提問。法官杜麗冰質疑，辯方提問無助於辯方案情，指除非辯方指控在證人錄取口供的過程中，遭受威逼而捏造證供，否則即使證人曾與警方談及證供，亦無助於辯方案情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;法庭頒令禁報保護證人計劃資料&quot;&gt;法庭頒令禁報保護證人計劃資料&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方提出，警方曾指導證人如何錄取口供。法官李運騰指，但早前盤問時，辯方並無向證人提出指導（coaching）、捏造（fabrication）及排練（rehearsing）證供等字眼。辯方指，曾提出「遊說（persuade）」等字眼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;經控辯雙方休庭商議後，法庭頒下命令，禁止任何人，包括報章及傳播媒體，以任何方式透露、發佈或報道在本案聆訊中任何可能導致關於參與者，或曾是參與者或曾被考慮納入任何保護證人計劃內的人的身分，或所在地點的資料、或危害此人安全的資料。任何違令者，可能會被視作藐視法庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件押後至下周一（20日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

President Tinubu’s economic policies, including ending fuel subsidies and currency devaluation, have sparked further economic decline, leading to inflation and discouraging investors, further hampering Nigeria’s economic potential and political stability.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nigerians like to say that when their country sneezes, the rest of Africa catches a cold. Whether by dint of the size of its economy or its population, Nigerians are rightfully proud of their country and its influence within the West African region and the wider world. And yet, many would also say that in recent years that influence has waned as Nigeria has struggled to rise above its internal challenges. Beset by poor governance, weak institutions, deteriorating security conditions, spiraling economic decline, and uninspired leadership, Nigeria’s current conditions present it as more of a sick man of Africa. For these reasons, many saw the country’s 2023 presidential elections as a chance to reset the narrative, begin the necessary process of reforming what ails the country, and chart a new course for the future of Africa’s largest country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper, researched and drafted in the opening months of the new Bola Tinubu government, considers some of the early policy choices the president has taken and his governing style thus far to develop expectations regarding the pace and quality of economic and governance reforms in the years to come. In particular, this paper focuses on the hydrocarbon sector, which has traditionally been Nigeria’s engine of economic growth and largest provider of hard currency. As the face of extractive industries in Nigeria evolves, along with global attitudes toward fossil fuels and green energy, this paper assesses how Nigeria is positioned locally to both benefit and be buffeted by this rapidly evolving landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tinubu-administration&quot;&gt;Tinubu Administration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;More of the Same?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bola Tinubu assumed the presidency of Nigeria in May 2023 with his back already firmly against the wall. Court challenges to his electoral victory hung over his first five months in office, creating distractions and defusing the kind of meaningful momentum that electoral victories often bring and which are important for new administrations to build the necessary energy for change and reform. Beyond the allegations of a fraudulent election, Tinubu was further saddled with the reputational harm that comes with being the first Nigerian president elected with without receiving a majority of the popular vote. Winning only 36 percent of cast ballots, Tinubu’s mandate coming into office could not have been weaker. Compounding this trust deficit, he took over Aso Rock, the presidential villa, with no grand vision for how he would administer the government and address the nation’s many challenges, nor a defined policy ag                                enda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Described by many as a consensus builder and dealmaker, he ran on his reputation as a results-oriented administrator capable of assembling teams of competent lieutenants able to achieve results — a reputation he made for himself as the governor of Lagos State from 1999 to 2007. But given the nearly two decades since he has held elected office, his detractors note that there is a substantial difference between making Nigeria’s complex patronage network function and being able to or interested in reforming it. In terms of reform, perhaps Nigeria’s most pressing and challenging priority, his early record suggests that he is likely to continue the tradition of prioritizing politics over governance, or as one local analyst remarked, “making things work despite government involvement, not because of it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the many structural challenges facing Nigeria’s economy and governance structures, Tinubu has shown in his first 10 months in office that his focus is likely to be much more on outcomes than on process, with many suggesting an “ends justifies the means” attitude toward governing. Several early policy pronouncements illustrate this style of governing and imply an impetuous and even ad hoc style of leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Tinubu’s cabinet choices have disappointed many who had hoped to see the kind of young, dynamic, and technocratic government officials he reportedly assembled during his time as Lagos State governor. Instead, his record number of ministerial appointments has created a bloated and unwieldy cabinet that again suggests that politics will trump public policy, as more party stalwarts and political allies have been rewarded with prized ministerial posts in lieu of more qualified reformers or technical experts, with only a few exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Tinubu’s decision to keep the position of petroleum minister for himself, as all previous Nigerian presidents have done, was clearly a missed opportunity to break from tradition and signal that a reform of Nigeria’s sclerotic revenue generator might be coming. Perhaps more importantly, it signals a business-as-usual approach to the sector, where the presidency maintains a firm grip over all contracts and investments in the country’s oil industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, hasty announcements of reforms to remove a national fuel subsidy and float the foreign exchange rate appear to have been done with little consultation with economic advisers and without any kind of short- or long-term strategy to mitigate the unintended consequences of his decisions. While many in Nigeria acknowledge that these moves were entirely necessary to begin to right the country’s economy, the dramatic devaluing of the naira and the soaring cost of everyday staples has set back the economy even further and disproportionately hurt average Nigerians, who the actions were intended to help. That these weighty decisions were enacted with no social safety net in place and without sufficient warning to Nigerian businesses has squandered an opportunity to demonstrate true political courage and instead made the policy change appear foolhardy and chaotic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, Tinubu’s robust defense of regional democracy in the face of Niger’s military coup and threats to employ Nigeria’s thinly stretched military to mount an invasion of Niger to restore to power its erstwhile president, Mohammed Bazoum, presented Tinubu as impetuous, uncalculating, and underprepared to manage the country’s complex foreign relations and internal security challenges. Nigeria’s military leaders were particularly angered at reportedly not having been consulted before Tinubu made his threats of military force against a nation that had largely been trained by Nigeria and with whom many of Nigeria’s Hausa officer corps share deep cultural and familial bonds. In the words of one retired general, “It was tantamount to declaring civil war.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Many analysts, politicians, and business leaders argue that Nigeria possesses the requisite laws and institutions for the effective functioning of an efficient state, but also that it has mostly lacked the kind of steadfast leadership required to challenge entrenched patronage networks.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many analysts, politicians, and business leaders argue that Nigeria possesses the requisite laws and institutions for the effective functioning of an efficient state, but also that it has mostly lacked the kind of steadfast leadership required to challenge entrenched patronage networks that continue to undermine the best intentions of even the most committed reformers. It is still too early to predict what direction Tinubu will choose. There is still a large amount of triage to undertake on the economy before larger structural reforms can be imagined, especially given the deleterious effects of his early economic choices. In short, if he can get there, a second term would be a more likely opportunity for President Tinubu to pursue true reforms, should he choose to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-future-of-nigerian-oil&quot;&gt;The Future of Nigerian Oil&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is perhaps no greater example of Nigeria’s unrealized potential than its oil industry. The well-documented failures and shortcomings of Nigeria’s hydrocarbon sector are a direct reflection of the inability and unwillingness of successive Nigerian governments to address debilitating governance challenges, rampant insecurity, and endemic corruption — all of which today form a vicious cycle that inhibits simple solutions. International oil companies (IOCs) are increasingly exploring options for leaving Nigeria’s onshore oil areas and concentrating in the deep offshore — or even departing Nigeria altogether. Along with mounting pressures from the global “net-zero” movement to shift away from fossil fuels and lower carbon emissions, Nigeria faces the critical question of whether oil can or should maintain its relative importance to the country’s economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The election of Tinubu has carried with it some hope, and even more promises, that renewed efforts will be taken to address the sector’s deficiencies and reinvigorate the hydrocarbon sector to once again be a driver of growth and much-needed foreign exchange. The president has proclaimed a desire to see the country boost its production to 4 million barrels per day, nearly tripling its present-day production level, which is itself well short of the country’s quota established under the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. Many see Tinubu’s personal experience working for an IOC and his family’s deep ties to the industry as giving him special insight into the sector and motivation to fix it. Today, the industry is viewed as much maligned, which one industry insider described as “broken at every level.” But such herculean ambitions require a genuine commitment to upending Nigeria’s vast oil-related patronage network, starting at the highest levels of the federal government and extending all the way down to the creeks of the Niger Delta’s expansive inland waterways. But a number of impediments stand in the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;governance&quot;&gt;Governance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, many argue that the oil industry itself is simply too big to disrupt and has too many entrenched interests embedded throughout for one person to address, even if that person is the president. Underscoring this point, many refer to Tinubu’s decision to reserve the position of petroleum minister for himself as a signal that he has no real interest in reforming the system he oversees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others point to passage of the landmark Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) as further proof that even legislative and regulatory tools are too little, too late in seeking to reform the sector. The PIA, at its inception, was intended to provide a comprehensive set of legal, governance, regulatory, and transparency measures to address many of the sector’s endemic challenges and to open Nigeria up to a new generation of investment. But few believe that the legislation, conceived of 20 years ago and passed in 2021, has arrived in time to either reverse the slow and steady decline of the oil sector or signal to outside investors that Nigerian leaders are in fact interested in transforming the industry into a model of growth and efficiency. Indeed, while Nigerian lawmakers were busy spending two decades debating how to transform and govern the industry to ensure its health well into the twenty-first century, the sector and the world changed around it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When debate started on the PIA, Nigeria was Africa’s oil behemoth, producing roughly 2.5 million barrels per day. Despite low-level insecurity and operational challenges associated with managing complex community relations, as the majority of Nigeria’s oil infrastructure crisscrosses literally thousands of local communities, oil majors had few other alternatives to Nigerian oil. That is no longer the case. As oil discoveries have been made all along the West African coast, not to mention major new discoveries in places further afield such as Uganda and Mozambique, IOCs now have a wealth of investment opportunities from which to choose. And importantly, those locations appear to be more secure and easier in which to operate — and seem to offer greater returns on investment. In particular, deeper offshore oil investments in Nigeria have emerged as more attractive to international investors for their higher revenue margins, absence of local community groups to manage, and lower vulnerability to unrest and insecurity, resulting in fewer production delays and higher profits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other element of the PIA’s development that has clearly backfired is the notion that the legislation would open the door to new investment to reinvigorate the sector. Instead, oil majors, preferring to see what direction this landmark legislative effort would take, have delayed for decades the kinds of necessary investments in upkeep, maintenance, and expansion of oil infrastructure that would allow Nigeria to even meet its existing production quotas. The result has been increasingly unreliable and faulty infrastructure, some of which is 50 to 60 years old, that is easily tampered with and prone to leakages and other failures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fundamental weakness in current onshore oil infrastructure has been exacerbated by fraught community relations as more and more responsibility for local development and service delivery has been foisted onto IOCs in the absence of tangible and sustained efforts at the local or federal levels. A vicious cycle currently exists whereby oil infrastructure is either vandalized or breaks down, creating environmental damage and exacerbating grievances with local communities. This in turn prompts lawsuits and clean-up efforts, which IOCs are left to negotiate with communities and largely occur absent any government oversight or intervention. It is perhaps no wonder that in this operationally challenging and litigious environment that oil majors in recent years have been choosing to defer promised onshore investments for which they hold exclusive licenses; in some cases, they have even chosen to return those licenses back to the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In the words of one Nigerian oil analyst, “Nigeria expected the rest of the world to wait for them to get their house in order, and instead [the world] got tired of waiting and moved on.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the words of one Nigerian oil analyst, “Nigeria expected the rest of the world to wait for them to get their house in order, and instead [the world] got tired of waiting and moved on.” However, it is not only the governance of the sector that has left so many actors, from the IOCs all the way down to the community level, so disillusioned and disheartened about the sector’s future. Even if President Tinubu committed to implementing the PIA and its many provisions governing community-IOC relations, the sector would still exist in the context of Nigeria’s wider governance failings, all of which require a top-down, comprehensive set of measures to address. Short of wholesale elite buy-in, this is difficult to envisage happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;security&quot;&gt;Security&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowhere is this governance failure on sharper display than in Nigeria’s overall lack of security, not only in the Niger Delta but across the country’s 36 states. Currently, Nigeria’s military, which is responsible for the country’s internal security, is deployed on security operations in 34 states, each of which has sustained a minimum of at least 20 conflict-related fatalities, though most cases involve far more. This is despite having fewer than 200,000 active-duty troops and only two functioning C-130 transport aircraft to move those forces. Chronically understaffed and undermotivated, they are also underfunded. The administration of former president Muhammadu Buhari reportedly needed to borrow funds externally to pay army salaries, with as many as one-third of army salaries being paid to ghost workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Security in the Niger Delta largely has been predicated on the notion that some combination of money and the military would fix the ailments of both the hydrocarbon sector and the local communities in which those operations take place. In reality, the opposite appears to be true.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, security in the Niger Delta largely has been predicated on the notion that some combination of money and the military would fix the ailments of both the hydrocarbon sector and the local communities in which those operations take place. In reality, the opposite appears to be true. The more money and forces deployed to the delta, the worse the security situation has become in recent years. Though assessments vary, at least one-quarter and as much as one-half of Nigeria’s daily oil output is being stolen by militant groups across the six states of the Niger Delta, to the point that the government has lost track of the number of pipeline attacks because there are so many.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sustained militancy in the delta is a function of both the absence of development dollars, which typically fail to make it to the community level, and the lack of jobs and economic opportunity for the increasingly young population. Despite the chronic insecurity this militancy engenders, oil theft creates higher-paying jobs than can be found on the local job market, fills the region’s energy gaps through small-scale refining, and has become the grease that literally helps the region to function — prompting one local community leader to assess, “Oil theft is state sanctioned instability.” With most of the Nigerian army and navy’s deployed forces in the region coming from northern and western states, delta militants remain at a distinct advantage in knowing the spiderweb of creeks and roads across the region. This local knowledge enables militants to evade even serious attempts at capture and has left the military looking feckless in its inability to effectively respond to this threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These trends are all epitomized in the announcement last year that former Niger Delta militant and kingpin of the illegal oil market Government Ekpemupolo, or “Tompolo,” had been granted a ₦48 billion (approx. $60 million when signed) annual contract by the federal government to provide pipeline security across the Niger Delta. Many saw this deal as a quiet, yet public acknowledgement by the state that it had been bested and is unable to provide effective pipeline security. Billed by the government as an amnesty and a works project for delta youth, it is hard to view this “fox guarding the henhouse” scenario as anything other than another government abdication of its responsibilities in the region — the first being the foisting of development responsibilities onto IOCs. This sad admission — that the best the government can do is award lucrative contracts to those responsible for inflicting pain on the nation — is not just a recognition that Nigeria is plundered, but that it is also rewarding criminals, bandits, and groups that take up arms against it. Unsurprisingly, despite the high levels of violence and militancy, the Niger Delta is not even Nigeria’s most unstable and violent region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One local community leader lamented that, “Everything about oil production is violent: from the discovery, to the extraction, to the refining and the flaring. You cannot escape it.” And with local security being turned over to militants — essentially paying bad actors to refrain from further attacks — the government seems to be both rewarding bad behavior and acknowledging their inability to stop it. With such a bleak security picture of and disheartening commentary on government capacity, few local leaders are surprised that commitment from IOCs to onshore production is in doubt and that the outlook for the sector appears bleak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;environmentalism-and-a-green-future&quot;&gt;Environmentalism and a Green Future&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 20 years that the oil industry has waited for the government to address the challenges facing oil production, trends were also emerging outside of the oil industry which are today similarly having a profound effect on the sector’s future in Nigeria. The race to net-zero carbon emissions and campaigns against fossil fuels are beginning to have profound effects on the industry in ways that will affect future investments and seemingly depress enthusiasm for new oil projects. But for communities in the delta, environmentalism has less to do with protecting the environment and reducing emissions and is much more focused on getting paid for past or ongoing environmental damage caused by vandalism or failing infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;For communities in the delta, environmentalism has less to do with protecting the environment and reducing emissions and is much more focused on getting paid for past or ongoing environmental damage caused by vandalism or failing infrastructure.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the net-zero movement exists within some community and advocacy circles, local politicians have appeared largely unmoved by the global climate change debate. In fact, many point to the fact that Western countries are continuing to make substantial new investments in fossil fuels as a sign that international calls by those countries to begin a shift toward more expensive green energy is little more than a new tool of colonialism. Instead, the priority in Nigeria has remained developing a greater abundance of affordable energy for the local market, though not necessarily from green sources. But many acknowledge that Nigeria may be approaching the stage where pursuing a greener future may in fact create opportunities for “leapfrogging,” especially as the cost of renewables inches closer to the price of oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many officials and business leaders acknowledge that “Nigeria is really a gas country,” in recognition of the fact that the country’s natural gas supply far surpasses its future oil reserves. They argue that a transition to gas for internal energy uses, as much as for export, is precisely the kind of initiative the government needs to jumpstart the economy and bring in a new source of foreign exchange. Similarly, others argue that Nigeria’s famous innovators and entrepreneurs would be well placed to help develop the sector if the government did more to incentivize innovation and create a market for its monetization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this kind of energy transition discussion has been slow to take hold among leaders and the population at large because of the stranglehold that big oil has on the economy and governance of the country. Nigeria, it is argued, is a rentier state that revolves around oil. Shifting away from that, or creating a new reality around gas or renewables, would mean undoing an entrenched, and in many ways perverse, incentive structure from the top down that politicians have neither the courage nor willingness to take on. Beyond that, it would also mean changing the popular conception that the country is an oil economy. In the delta in particular, local activists argue that, given the harm and destruction the oil industry has wrought on the region, communities are unwilling to abandon it without first seeing some of the benefits that they have long been promised from the resource. Indeed, many locals express concern about a de-emphasis on oil or the rumored departure of IOCs, arguing that it is not fair to suffer the negative impacts of the industry for so long without reaping sufficient benefit. With President Tinubu’s removal of fuel subsidies, this argument is even more resonant today as communities throughout Nigeria are now forced to pay the equivalent of a month’s salary for a tank of gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from a handful of civil society organizations and delta-based NGOs, there has been no strong indigenous advocacy movement from key actors in Nigeria pressing for a transition to clean energy or a move away from oil production. This lack of political leadership or organized public demands has made progress slow. But President Tinubu’s recent appointment of a minster of gas is seen by some as a potentially hopeful sign. To operationalize those efforts, others have argued for a gas master plan that puts in place a gas policy and strategic development plan for the sector’s future. Beyond that, many argue that if gas is to be developed, the government must do a better job from the start of maximizing the benefits for local communities during the development of the asset. Unless equity is established between local communities and gas production, Nigeria risks recreating the toxic and unstable environment that is already entrenched in the oil sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-growth-of-indigenous-firms&quot;&gt;The Growth of Indigenous Firms&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the many challenges of governance, security, and community relations faced by IOCs in operating in the onshore Niger Delta, coupled with the increasing global pressures to disinvest from fossil fuels, it is no wonder that many of Nigeria’s oil majors are discussing or actively seeking to pull out of Nigeria’s onshore environment. And yet, most of the major oil industry stakeholders, whether business executives, local communities, politicians, or civil society groups, all appear sharply divided over what the net effect would be of having indigenous Nigerian oil companies assume the assets and production capacity of international operators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some argue that the departure of large international oil operators presents a historic opportunity to develop local talent, keep Nigeria’s vast oil wealth in Nigeria where it can better benefit the Nigerian people and economy, and become more responsive to the needs and demands of the communities where the oil is extracted. But arguing, as many do, that traditional IOCs have always overpromised and underdelivered on their local commitments excuses many of the structural impediments to efficient operations that companies of any national origin will face in Nigeria’s rough and tumble delta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-mixed-picture&quot;&gt;A Mixed Picture&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a number of points, the argument often made by the sector’s stakeholders — that indigenous operations would have the inherent tools to succeed — can in fact cut both ways. Many argue that Nigeria possesses the requisite pool of local skilled talent after decades of oil production to run the industry from the wellheads to the boardroom. But others point to the endemic corruption and inside information that comes from many of those same locally employed staff. How, it is argued, can upwards of half of Nigeria’s daily production output be stolen without the leakage of inside information to militants regarding where and when to strike? Will these relationships recede when Nigerian ownership is installed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the argument goes that there is enough security in the delta, with large-scale deployments of federal army and naval forces. But again, many assume that those forces will be more dedicated to protecting locally owned and operated assets than foreign-owned ones. This assumption similarly ignores the basic reality that delta militants remain substantially better armed, better informed, and better motivated than federal security forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the development front, operators contend that there are sufficient development resources already in the delta to counter the threats to operators and vandalism of infrastructure. They argue that violence will be minimized against local operators, pointing to the provision of the PIA requiring oil operators to pay 3 percent of profits into a local community development fund. However, previously unpublished audits of those trust funds suggest that development dollars are being siphoned off before making it to local communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOME LOCAL ADVANTAGES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most obvious and significant advantage observers point to that locally owned Nigerian firms would have over their international counterparts is simply that they are local. Western multinationals are seen as deep pocketed and as susceptible to the kinds of pressures that local communities, militant groups, and politicians can bring to bear. These leverage points against IOCs have grown even more pronounced against the backdrop of global climate change discussions and environmental justice debates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local operators, it is argued, will be seen as having fewer resources to pay militants or corrupt politicians; as unwilling to buy off local communities with gifts or development projects to create goodwill or compensate for environmental damage; and as less of a security target for militant groups. Being Nigerian, these operators are also seen as likely to be less susceptible to the kinds of shareholder pressure and bad press that impacts IOCs located in Houston, London, or the Hague. Such IOCs are constantly spending to ward off bad press associated with local lawsuits related to everything from environmental damage to unfair labor practices to unmet promises to local communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communities seeking to gain leverage over locally owned and operated Nigerian operators would have to sue them in Nigerian courts, seek compensation in naira, and work through Nigerian politicians and the Nigerian press to plead their cases. This is decidedly a far less appealing, less effective, and less lucrative avenue for seeking redress, which many believe will dissuade such formal legal proceedings from becoming as widespread as they are today with IOCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, because local firms are understood to be more resource constrained than major multinationals, many believe that violence, vandalism, and environmental damage will go down markedly as soon as it is understood that the prospect of a substantial payday is not waiting for malign actors in the way it may have been before. However, not all Nigerian operators are monolithic, and some may feel that having fewer activist shareholders and being free from the constraints of Western anti-corruption legislation, such as the United States’ Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, will give them many of the benefits of being both a smaller target and more able to respond in ways that continue to challenge IOCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SIGNIFICANT DOWNSIDES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as local firms present some obvious advantages to their international oil counterparts, it may become quickly apparent that having a smaller size and capitalization comes with a number of distinct disadvantages as well that are unlikely to benefit the local communities or wider economy. This is especially true when it comes to the kinds of leverage local groups might have over oil companies to press demands, which will have to be channeled through local, state, and federal politicians and institutions, including the courts. These indigenous firms are unlikely to be as responsive as IOCs, which have activist shareholders and boards seeking to minimize bad press and operational risks. Similarly, without foreign courts adjudicating disputes, many fear that more pressure will be put on Nigeria’s weak judicial and law enforcement agencies to govern the sector more actively. Given the overall governance challenges already endemic in Nigeria, this suggests an environment where local voices have less ability to hold decisionmakers accountable for the matters that affect them directly. Some local activists are worried that local operators would take shortcuts on issues such as health, safety, security, and workers’ rights because they do not fear the same repercussions that an IOC might feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, some local oil operators suggest that the biggest challenges they face, which are felt locally, are the cost and availability of the capital necessary to maintain and even grow their operations. One operator calculated that the cost of capital for hydrocarbon projects in the United States is 6 percent, compared to 13 percent in Nigeria, thus putting a 7 percent risk premium on any project for which they seek to raise funds. In addition, they noted that the overall race to net zero is hindering the global capital flow to hydrocarbon projects. If a local project is not self-financed, it would have to pursue large decarbonization offsets and substantial environmental, social, and governance (ESG) components in order to raise money from Western sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this resource-constrained environment, where environmental concerns often trump demand, indigenous firms are likely to have fewer resources on hand to operate and maintain the existing, and failing, infrastructure networks they have bought into, let alone the substantial new resources needed to bring online Nigeria’s remaining reserves. Instead, what many expect to see is indigenous firms looking to squeeze what is left of a dying industry in a bid to maximize profits but not production. As a result, many suspect to see a proliferation of small and resource-constrained local operators entering the onshore market, surrendering the production efficiencies of large firms and accelerating production declines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-economic-study-in-contradictions&quot;&gt;An Economic Study in Contradictions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Tinubu came into office with sky-high expectations for reviving the economy and delivering an economic miracle to the country, as people recall him doing for Lagos State during his time as governor. Eight years of statist policies and interventions in the economy under the previous Buhari government — defined by capital controls, heavy government borrowing, and costly subsidies on everything from foreign exchange to fuel and electricity — have left the economy in a historically bad position. And while Tinubu is looking for quick wins to stem the hemorrhaging of the economy, he is not seen as a reformer. People are expecting to see more liberalization and less intervention from the government in the economy. At the same time, he has given little indication that he is likely to do much to break the current patronage system so central to the Nigerian economic model and rebuild it more efficiently under the rule of law. Absent such reform, Nigeria’s economic outlook will remain highly unpredictable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Nigeria’s economy is rife with contradictions that President Tinubu appears, so far, ill-equipped to reverse.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Nigeria’s economy is rife with contradictions that President Tinubu appears, so far, ill-equipped to reverse. First, although the president came into office on the tail of multiyear rises in the global price of oil, Nigeria finds itself in the unenviable position of watching its own internal fiscal situation deteriorate precipitously. Similarly, the quick wins promised by Tinubu in the campaign have translated quite simply into quick losses. His inaugural announcements to end costly fuel subsidies and float Nigeria’s currency, the naira, had the near-immediate effect of accelerating the country’s economic decline, to the point that the naira has lost nearly 100 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar since the float was announced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On paper, Nigeria has the potential to be Africa’s economic powerhouse. It already has the continent’s largest economy and population and is expected to have the third-largest population globally by 2050. Fed by a large middle class, the president’s business-friendly rhetoric and promises to usher in a new era of deregulation, private sector–led growth and development, and job creation have struck many as the right message at the moment. But once again, his early economic choices have hurt those he claims to be trying to help the most. With real inflation running somewhere between 50 and 75 percent each month, overall consumption is starting to fall, further contributing to the downward economic pressures and beginning to shrink the much ballyhooed middle-class segment. That shrinkage is only further exacerbated by a rising, record-level brain drain, as many Nigerians with better options are voting with their feet and leaving the country for easier and more prosperous lives in the diaspora.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop of economic decline, oil majors and the middle class are not the only ones seeking an exit from Nigeria’s economy. Large providers of consumer goods, such as the South African retailer Shoprite and Western giants such as Proctor &amp;amp; Gamble and Unilever, have also decided to end efforts to manufacture in the country and have instead shifted to a distributor model for selling goods in Nigeria. This move away from value-added production — owing to severe capital controls that mean it can take as long as six months to repatriate hard currency earnings — and the precipitous decline of the naira are sure to push Nigeria further down the economic ladder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This unmet potential and Nigeria’s declining economic fortunes have been compounded by Tinubu’s rash economic decisionmaking and seeming lack of a comprehensive economic plan. But one trait the country’s detractors can rarely explain and are challenged to quantify is its resiliency. This resiliency has enabled the country to survive and succeed sometimes despite itself. But for too long, as one local business analyst noted, “Nigeria walks and talks like a country that is wealthy, but it’s not. The image that Nigeria has of itself is not the truth.” The question remains whether the departure of decades-long pillars of Nigeria’s business community will be enough to speak the kind of truth to power in Abuja that can initiate much-needed governance reform and institutional strengthening. Thus far, too few have been willing to undertake the changes needed to help Nigeria develop into the economic powerhouse it can be and thinks it already is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regrettably, President Tinubu’s early economic missteps suggest that he might draw the wrong lessons from his bold economic choices. Instead, Nigerians are hoping he learns from that hasty start and sets upon a trajectory of thoughtful and deliberate economic reforms that tap into the country’s natural advantages. Short of that, Nigeria’s economic and political fortunes are likely to remain unpredictable and contradictory.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;國安警稱與張劍虹談「獄中日常」 辯方質疑會面逾3小時、目的游說做控方證人&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/cS7gJjL.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（16日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第77日審訊。辯方早前申請重召前《蘋果》社長張劍虹出庭作供，冀就通訊群組Slack內的「飯盒會」紀錄提問，惟3名法官宣布拒絕申請，指不符司法公義。駐守國安處的偵緝警署警長接著作供，他曾於2021年11月到監獄向張劍虹派送判詞，形容張閱讀判詞後將它「冚埋」並思考了10分鐘，警長遂提出：「不如我哋傾吓偈吖。」然後張談及獄中生活，翌日便主動提出轉做控方證人。辯方則質疑，該次會面歷時逾3小時，真正原因是警方游說張劍虹出任控方證人，惟警長不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方申重召張劍虹被拒-官指明顯不符司法公義&quot;&gt;辯方申重召張劍虹被拒 官指明顯不符司法公義&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方早前申請重召前《蘋果》社長張劍虹出庭作供，冀就蘋果員工通訊群組 Slack 內的「飯盒會」紀錄提問。法官今拒絕申請，認為辯方在審前已獲得充分通知，控方會依賴被告在「飯盒會」上說過的話，而控方開案陳詞、張劍虹、陳沛敏等供詞也有提及「飯盒會」，並於2022年6月前送達辯方。此外，張劍虹作供首天已供稱他被黎智英要求記錄「飯盒會」重點，而黎亦是該 Slack 群組的成員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/mO32oIs.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 左起：張劍虹、黎智英、周達權（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官亦認為，辯方在盤問張劍虹前，有充足機會準備案情和索取 Slack 紀錄。法官指，本案原定於2022年12月開審，最終延至2023年12月，而控方於開案陳詞曾提到 Slack 紀錄的截圖，辯方在盤問張劍虹時亦曾展示相關截圖，而 Slack 作為《蘋果》員工內部溝通方式，難以說黎智英對該紀錄並不知情。法官信納 Slack 紀錄能夠亦應該在審前索取，尤其辯方有多於兩年時間準備本案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官續指，黎智英的公平審訊權利，不會因法庭拒絕重召張劍虹而受影響，因辯方能在辯方案情提出相關紀錄，又指如那真的發生，便輪到控方考慮應否重召張劍虹。法官同意控方指，司法公義同樣適用於控方及辯方，不論辯方申請動機為何，但單從事實來看，批准重召張劍虹明顯不符司法公義，故拒絕批准申請。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;警署警長稱獲指示派判詞予張劍虹-主動提議不如傾吓偈&quot;&gt;警署警長稱獲指示派判詞予張劍虹 主動提議「不如傾吓偈」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後應辯方要求，傳召曾探訪張劍虹的警員供辯方盤問。張早前接受盤問時，曾透露2021年11月一名警署警長到荔枝角收押所要求會見他，會面長達約6小時，翌日該警長連同另一名偵緝警員再訪，張在會面突然提出想成為控方證人。辯方質疑警長游說張做控方證人，惟張否認，堅稱會面純粹談論荔枝角的生活和運動，又指「因為我睇完個判詞之後，自己開始去諗，想講返個事實出嚟囉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;當日探訪張劍虹的偵緝警署警長黎國勇（音譯）作供，他自1994年10月加入警隊，2020年7月26日獲委派處理本案，現時駐守警方國安處。他供稱，2021年11月11日，被總督察李書權指派到荔枝角懲教所，向張劍虹派發一份判詞。黎指會見室內，二人隔着透明板對望坐着，張花了約20至30分鐘自行閱讀判詞，「睇完又睇」，讀完後把判詞「冚埋」，「跟住佢就冇出聲，個樣係諗緊嘢嘅」，歷時約10分鐘。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎指，張當時無打破沉默，「係由我開聲先嘅」，他問張：「你有冇特別嘢啊？」張答：「冇」，他再問：「你真係冇嘢？」張再答：「冇嘢」，黎遂說：「不如我哋傾吓偈吖。」被問為何提議二人聊天，他解釋「大家打破沉默啫，冇特別原因」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;警指談及還柙生活-無談及本案及邀張任證人&quot;&gt;警指談及還柙生活 無談及本案及邀張任證人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎續指，二人大致談及張扣留期間的日常，張提到自己被獨立囚禁，故「平時冇人同佢接觸同埋傾偈」，又指自己起床吃早餐後，會去天台做運動。黎問張做什麼運動，張稱自己多年來都有習慣，玩類似太極的運動「站樁」，運動完「成身都濕晒」便會去洗澡。張續稱，之後他就等人探訪，又指自己是基督徒，通常是由女朋友和牧師探訪，其後就等吃飯，並提及獄中的膳食、他定期訂購的外賣、他喜歡吃什麼。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 前《蘋果日報》社長 張劍虹（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎指，會面期間張劍虹無向他作出任何要求，亦無談及本案證據，他也沒有邀請張任控方證人。其後「因為我見傾得太耐」，黎曾建議張「不如食飯先」，但張指「唔需要」，因他可以稍後返監倉吃飯，可繼續傾，但黎仍覺得「耐」，遂於下午約2時45分稱：「不如我哋傾到呢度啦」，張回應：「不如你聽日再嚟探我啦」，因除了朋友和宗教探訪「冇乜人探佢」。黎指，當天約4時返回辦事處向總督察匯報，上司無再作指示，他並於翌日再探訪張。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;記事冊列派判詞為特別任務-與國安相關&quot;&gt;記事冊列派判詞為「特別任務」 與國安相關&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎國勇其後接受辯方大律師關文渭盤問，他確認沒有出席張劍虹2021年11月5日的保釋申請聆訊，但從新聞得知張被拒保釋。而11月11日早上他在區域法院工作，但受上司指派返辦公室拿判詞交張劍虹。辯方展示記事冊，顯示黎寫有「0915 attend to Crt」後刪去，下一項則為「1630 From Ct by SP instruct by sp, SD Duty」，同被刪去。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/97onnx2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
▲ 大律師 關文渭&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎確認「SD duty（Special duty）」是與國安相關，並解釋是「我自己寫錯」，當時警司要求他做有關國安的工作，但隨即說不需要，他遂即時刪去並簽名，同意是「好⋯⋯唔小心嘅錯誤嚟」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;記事冊續顯示，「0930 instruct by CIP C1 SD duty and proceed to LCK correctional center 派發判詞 HCCP 418/2021」。被問派判詞是否「特別任務」，黎形容特別任務（SD）是籠統的工作，「SD」是他們用的簡寫，而「我哋通常都唔會寫其他嘢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;警長稱無調查過張劍虹不認識他-無考究為何非下級警員派判詞&quot;&gt;警長稱無調查過張劍虹、不認識他 無考究為何非下級警員派判詞&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在盤問下指，上司僅着他派判詞予張劍虹，無告知他張當時有法律代表、判詞前一日已公開。辯方問他對判詞內容是否有興趣，黎答：「冇，因為我一路都冇調查過佢，我唔識佢嘅。」黎又形容，當時上司是將判詞放在公文袋，着他待會去荔枝角交給張劍虹，「其實冇詳細解釋㗎，我淨係好單純咁接咗就攞去㗎喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎又指，公文袋有膠紙封住，他沒有打開過，是到了荔枝角後由張自己打開，黎向張稱「呢份係判詞，我今日嚟攞畀你嘅」。黎當時無問張的律師是否已給他判詞，亦「冇諗過」張是否已知悉自己保釋被拒。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，黎是偵緝警署警長，有下級警員，為何不是由下級警員而是他派判詞？黎指「呢個係我上級嘅 judgement，我冇去考究」。關文渭續問黎是否C1隊的第二負責人，黎不同意，指有其他警署警長，總督察下亦有督察。關文渭一度追問誰是另一名警署警長，黎質疑涉及編制不可透露，法官杜麗冰亦質疑與案無關，辯方遂無再追問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;警長認無準備收據予張劍虹簽收覺得冇需要&quot;&gt;警長認無準備收據予張劍虹簽收：覺得冇需要&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎續同意，一般警方將文件送達被告時，會要求簽收，但當天沒有要求張劍虹簽收，他出發往荔枝角時亦沒有準備收據。辯方追問原因，黎解釋「我當時覺得冇需要」，指「我自己記事冊有記錄啦，我真誠真係派咗畀佢，我兩手空空離開，我相信呢個係真誠嘅動作記錄嚟嘅，我亦都深信張劍虹唔會話我冇派過判詞畀佢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關文渭一度指，看來派判詞予張劍虹的工作很重要，因是「特別任務」的一部分，黎稱：「我只係執行我嘅指示，我冇去判斷係咪一個咁嘅工作」；法官李運騰亦說，特別任務不代表是重要，而辯方是在問及證人意見，關遂無再追問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在辯方盤問下，黎警長確認沒有任何文件證明他有把判詞交給張劍虹。辯方指，黎警長理應知道，如果沒有得到懲教署署長的許可，而將文件交給在囚人士，可構成刑事罪行。黎確認：「係呀。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;警長否認錄口供時知道張劍虹庭上證供&quot;&gt;警長否認錄口供時知道張劍虹庭上證供&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎續確認，今年2月曾就該次會面錄取證人供詞，但不同意當時已知道張庭上作供的內容，稱自己「有睇新聞，冇向同事了解」。黎續在法官李運騰詢問下，指張劍虹作供時他不在庭內，「我淨係知道佢作供，法官閣下，我冇去真係了解件事啊」，他不知道張庭上說什麼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方質疑警長職責只限派送判詞-沒有任何理由留下來與張劍虹談獄中日常&quot;&gt;辯方質疑警長職責只限派送判詞 沒有任何理由留下來與張劍虹談「獄中日常」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方質疑，若然上級的指示只是叫黎派送判詞給張劍虹，為何黎把判詞交給張之後，不立即離開懲教所。黎則指當時讓張閱讀判詞，而張亦低頭閱讀。辯方遂質疑，根據黎警長的證供，他坐著20至30分鐘，等待張劍虹閱讀判詞，接著又坐多10分鐘等待張思考，惟毫無目的和原因。黎僅回答：「係呀。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又質疑，黎的供詞紀錄、記事冊和調查報告中，從沒有提及過張劍虹閱讀判詞之後把判詞「冚埋」、思考10分鐘，接著黎問張：「你有冇特別嘢啊？」，張回答：「冇。」黎亦同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又質疑，黎在11月11日會見了張劍虹超過2小時，並在庭上供稱張談及獄中生活，包括膳食、運動、探訪者等，然而在黎的記事冊中，這些對話內容僅以「獄中生活」四個字來概括，直至庭上作供才首次提及詳情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，會面結束的時候，二人已經會面超過3小時。黎同意，並稱：「張劍虹講嘢呢，我冇阻止佢，係由佢講嘅」，又形容這是「一個正常嘅交談」。辯方則指，這似乎像朋友之間的對話。惟黎不同意：「唔講得上係朋友嘅交談。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，除了向張劍虹派送判詞之外，黎警長並沒有任何理由（justification）留下來與張劍虹談論「獄中日常」。黎同意。不過當辯方問，當黎與張談論「獄中日常」的時候，是否正在執行警務人員的職務，黎稱：「係。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎與張劍虹會面3小時，真正原因是游說張劍虹出任控方證人。黎不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方質疑偵緝警長游說張劍虹轉做控方證人&quot;&gt;辯方質疑偵緝警長游說張劍虹轉做控方證人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，翌日即11月12日，黎與另一名偵緝警員8215再度探訪張劍虹。黎確認，並指當時會見不久後，有親友要探訪張，所以張被懲教人員帶走，而兩名警員需等候張。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，當張劍虹與親友會見完，他回來之後，第一句向警員說的說話是他表明想做控方證人。黎亦確認。辯方質疑，張的說話會否使警員感到意外？黎表示：「會呀。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方向黎提議，黎在11月11日的會面中游說張劍虹轉做控方證人，並叫他用一晚時間考慮。黎否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方另質疑，黎在今年2月就探訪張劍虹的過程錄取供詞之前，曾經閱讀過有關張劍虹的新聞。黎否認，稱：「冇刻意睇新聞」，即使有也不會影響他的記憶和紀錄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指，在今年2月的供詞中，黎才首度指稱會面於下午2時45分結束，質疑他不可能相隔如此長時間後記得相關時間。黎則回應：「係呀，當時我都覺得時間好長，張劍虹未食飯，而我亦都未食飯。我好記得我睇睇個錶，係3點前。」辯方質疑為何黎不一早在記事冊中寫下「11:30至2:45，與張劍虹交流獄中生活」，惟黎稱：「我覺得未必需要」，因為他離開懲教院所時，懲教署會有時間紀錄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;紀錄顯示偵緝警長曾赴小欖探訪陳梓華14次&quot;&gt;紀錄顯示偵緝警長曾赴小欖探訪陳梓華14次&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又向黎展示另一名「從犯證人」陳梓華的探訪紀錄，顯示在2022年8月至11月9日期間，黎曾到小欖精神病治療中心探訪陳梓華合共14次。黎確認。辯方又問黎，在14次會面期間，陳梓華有否提及他的3份證人供詞有不準確之處。黎稱沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎作供未完，案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The treaty is the latest in the planned steps for developing the tri-country sixth-generation fighter, known in the UK as Tempest, and it cements the partnership as well as establishing its governance structures. Signing the treaty is, arguably, the easy part, and the UK and its partners must now continue to do the hard work to get the aircraft into service on time. This work includes reaching consensus on the multinational prerequisites for the initial capability, adopting a design philosophy that facilitates capability expansion over the system’s lifespan, and establishing agreements on support arrangements and a continuous upgrade trajectory. It will be challenging to address all of these factors effectively, yet they are just as vital to the programme’s success as overcoming the numerous technological challenges in developing a next-generation multi-role combat aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This analysis does not address the full GCAP agenda but focuses on the initial and evolving capabilities of the aircraft. It looks at aircraft-specific capability elements before addressing the capabilities of the platform as whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-sixth-gen&quot;&gt;Why Sixth Gen?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are multiple reasons for the UK’s pursuit of GCAP, including preservation and development of a notable defence industrial and technological capability and the benefits it could bring to the UK economy. More strictly in the defence domain, the governmental commitment to operational independence requires a system that can be deeply understood in order to be sustainable and modifiable in the UK. Importantly, the threat environment beyond 2040, around which the programme is directed, implies a need for a system that delivers a step change in capability from current fifth-generation aircraft (such as the F-35 and F-22). Indeed, the development of technologies driving the evolution of the threat environment is happening rapidly and is seeing massive investment from state actors. This is transforming the threat landscape significantly, thereby requiring a new capability not only to act as a deterrent but also to defeat these threats and ensure continued ability to deliver the necessary military effect. This is reflected in the US’s commitment to the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) programme, aimed at replacing the F-22 fighter jets and developing a portfolio of technologies to ensure continued air superiority. Similarly, France, Germany and Spain are pursuing the Système de Combat Aérien du Futur (SCAF) programme to replace French Rafale jets and Eurofighter Typhoons from Germany and Spain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to UK next-generation capability development, it is important to distinguish between GCAP, Future Combat Air System (FCAS) and Tempest. The UK’s next-generation combat air capability development is housed within its FCAS programme, which includes a future core platform (crewed aircraft); uncrewed aircraft of various possible various types, also known as Adjuncts or Autonomous Collaborative Platforms (ACPs); next-generation effectors (weapons), command, control and information systems; and through-life services (sustainment, upgrade and training). The GCAP collaboration is the trilateral partnership and programme that will deliver the crewed fighter (known as Tempest in the UK) component of the FCAS, which is also aligned to the Japanese and Italian requirements for a next-generation crewed combat aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to understand that UK combat air platforms already operate within a wider system and have done at least since the beginning of the Second World War. The RAF prevailed in the Battle of Britain through exploitation of ground-based radars (the Chain Home system), information analysts, a ground-based command system and fighter aircraft. However, what is envisaged in FCAS is much more complex and capable than anything previously established, and its sophistication is likely to incrementally increase. Most notably, and unlike previous combat air systems, it is envisaged that the FCAS will operate in conjunction with ACPs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fundamental-defence-capabilities&quot;&gt;Fundamental Defence Capabilities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attributes of GCAP’s next-generation crewed combat aircraft can be analysed using the framework of the seven Fundamental Defence Capabilities (Deploy, Inform, Command, Operate, Sustain, Prepare, Protect) specified in the second edition of British Defence Doctrine in 2001. This framework offers a structure within which specific requirements can be located and assessed. As will be shown in the sections below, it is also useful for clearly relating GCAP to FCAS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;deploy&quot;&gt;Deploy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any defence system needs to be locatable or movable to the area where it can be useful. Combat aircraft are usually flown to where they are needed from an equipped base either at home or overseas. Beyond the characteristics of an intended airfield, deployability away from a prepared base must take account of the support equipment that an aircraft needs, especially for maintenance. The US Government Accountability Office has reported that 13 C-17 flights are needed to transport the support equipment for a short-notice deployment of 12 F-35s. The less support equipment is needed, the easier deployability should be. In terms of deployment range, from a UK point of view, the RAF is likely to want more from the aircraft than the 450 miles associated with the F-35B for unrefuelled combat radius.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the international partnership level, the three GCAP partners might also address whether they should commit to establishing and maintaining a common infrastructure for the programme, so that any partner could deploy its aircraft to another partner with the minimum testing, diagnostic and maintenance equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;inform&quot;&gt;Inform&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important question concerns what level of performance will be required of the core platform to collect a hefty amount of data and to analyse its significance onboard the aircraft. These are matters for sensors and computers with computerised integration of information, creating both an opportunity and a significant challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data could be collected from onboard radar, infrared, electromagnetic and even noise sensors that receive material from different ends of the aircraft. The Inform agenda raises the questions of cost, weight and electricity: the more sensors, the heavier and costlier the aircraft and the greater the need for electric power. To enable spiral development and its electrical needs, the power and propulsion plant should be designed with significant spare capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The increased amount of data available will need to be quickly processed and integrated into a meaningful picture. It will be necessary to determine whether data synthesis will be primarily driven by human input or to what extent onboard computer facilities can be trusted to provide a clearer understanding of ongoing events and potential actions. There will be a demand and an opening for enhanced integration of AI-powered sensors onboard. However, it is crucial to be cautious about “conspiracies of optimism” regarding the Inform requirements, as evidenced by the persistent delays and cost escalations seen with the F-35 programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;With technological developments driving a rapid evolution in the threat environment, a new capability will need to be able not only to act as a deterrent but also to defeat threats as they emerge&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GCAP platform is likely to be specified to be able to be informed from the beginning by extant UK platforms including Wedgetail, Reaper, the F-35 and Typhoon. However, the RAF envisages having ACPs in service by 2030 – that is before the Tempest aircraft is ready. The extent to which the GCAP will be able to benefit from and contribute to other systems from the outset should be covered in what the Ministry of Defence’s (MoD) 2024 New Procurement Model referred to as minimum deployable capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also the issue of the compatibility of the wider system, including design philosophy and interoperability, with partners. Japan, for instance, may be influenced by any US encouragement to participate in its Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) for ACP requirements, and to focus on potential US aircraft for training. The question arises whether these matters pose challenges for GCAP or if they remain distinct enough from it to operate separately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;command&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon receiving analysed information, the allocation of control over GCAP capabilities between machinery and the crew, as well as the extent to which the pilot will be guided by external sources, still needs to be determined. The fact that the US, France and the UK are all pursuing a new piloted aircraft suggests that no major state is yet ready to rely entirely on autonomous or even remotely controlled systems. However, the volume of information that could be available to the pilot may means that, to avoid information overload, physical control over the aircraft may largely have to be the responsibility of a machine. The human–machine division of labour is still unclear at this stage, but developments in AI and machine learning are expected to play a significant role in supporting the pilot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The optimum scope of a pilot’s capacity to control other airborne objects needs further work, and there will likely be learning and evolution in this area. Conceptually, the GCAP pilot may have a much wider role than that of pilots to date, directing other airborne systems as part of the FCAS or beyond, while being a key node in multi-domain operations on sea and land as well as in the air. Namely, the GCAP core platform will envisage the pilots as an integrated part of the system, with human-machine interface technologies allowing them to focus on making the right decisions at the right time and making them “battlespace operators”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;operate&quot;&gt;Operate&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The operational capabilities and arrangements of the aircraft are crucial considerations. It is safe to expect it to possess the capability to engage targets across air, ground and sea domains. Additionally, determining the balance between equipping the aircraft with informational collection and distribution systems versus kinetic weapons and other effectors is essential. As emphasised in John Boyd’s Observe, Orient, Decide and Act loop framework, the ability to act effectively is closely intertwined with the capacity to receive and analyse data, underscoring the importance of information and its timely analysis in decision-making and operational effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its range needs will be defined in terms of the breadth of missions set out in the operational requirements, the location of potential targets and the need for secure basing. Given that the sixth-generation fighter jet is for the UK and Italy the successor to Typhoon, these countries are likely to insist that it should have the capability to at least perform the equivalent air-to-air and air-to-surface roles in the future operating environment that are currently performed by Typhoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aeronautical characteristics of the platform will shape its capacity to deliver needed operational capability. These include a wide range of factors such as maximum and minimum height, maximum and minimum speed, range, payload, turn capability and climb rate. To date, GCAP looks set to deliver a comparatively large platform because weapons must be stored internally to preserve low observability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sustain&quot;&gt;Sustain&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukraine war has underscored the importance of a country’s ability to sustain a war effort. The Sustain element of capability is important both operationally and financially: major platforms require much more expenditure over even a decade than they did to produce. It is therefore vital to give sustainment capabilities an important place in requirement specification during the earlier stages of requirement setting and project planning. Past experience suggests that insufficient investment in these areas at the design stage can impose substantial extra cost during operational service. When Ben Wallace was defence secretary, he complained in public about the operating costs of the F-35, so the Tempest should target being less expensive to use than that aircraft, which is a significant challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sustainment encompasses a multitude of critical considerations that must be addressed. These include, among others, the deployment of necessary test and analysis equipment to operational locations, determining the requisite number and qualifications of personnel for platform maintenance, establishing reliability benchmarks for subsystems and the overall platform, ensuring ease of maintenance and repair procedures, managing inventory levels and associated costs to maintain specified aircraft availability rates, and proactively addressing obsolescence challenges. While accurately forecasting these factors before development reaches an advanced stage is inherently challenging, prioritising design for reliability and availability is a must.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;prepare&quot;&gt;Prepare&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effective use of any armed force and its equipment relies heavily on comprehensive and effective training. Like the F-35, the Tempest aircraft does not include a two-seat version in its plans. Therefore, training for the GCAP countries will necessitate a combination of experience on other aircraft and simulation sessions to sufficiently prepare a solo pilot for their inaugural flight on the sixth-generation aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Integrating combat-related elements of GCAP, such as interoperability with other platforms, into simulators can potentially reduce the amount of time needed for both initial training and ongoing pilot proficiency. Live flying training is not only costly but also exposes aircraft features and performance to potential adversaries. Flying simulators, however, can potentially pose retention challenges as pilots may seek more active flying roles or opportunities in the commercial sector if confined to simulator-based training for extended periods. A delicate balance will have to be struck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prepare dimension prompts consideration of the attributes required for the successor to the Hawk trainer aircraft, which also serves to train future Typhoon and F-35 pilots. Finally, within the Prepare agenda, it is essential to tackle the issue of surrogate trainers. These are more economical platforms aimed at maintaining pilot proficiency, safeguarding platform security, and enhancing pilot retention. It is worth considering how this requirement aligns with both pilot training and aggressor training needs, as there may be overlapping areas where resources and strategies can be shared for greater efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;protect&quot;&gt;Protect&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the above elements of capability will need to be protected against hostile action which will evolve over time. Physical safeguarding of a platform encompasses its core features such as low observability, along with defensive measures like warning systems, decoys, flares and countermeasures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;For the GCAP partners, it is vital to develop a platform capable of dealing with the envisaged capabilities of anticipated adversaries post-2035&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GCAP partners must deliberate on the significance of stealth and overall low observability, considering advancements in radar technology and the trade-offs associated with carrying numerous external weapons. While it may be premature to entirely abandon aspirations for low observability, even a stealthy aircraft requires effective defensive aids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond low observability and aerodynamic performance, various options exist for aircraft self-protection. These include established defensive aids such as missile and radar warning systems, as well as weaponised countermeasures like air-to-air missiles. Additionally, the emergence of directed energy weapons, such as lasers, could become a reality by 2035.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aircraft must strike the right balance between offensive and defensive systems, with the flexibility to adjust this balance for specific missions. Last but not least, the cyber security and cyber resilience dimensions are pivotal to protecting the core system and the overall “system of systems” approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2035-and-beyond&quot;&gt;2035 and Beyond&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Balancing requirements across the seven areas of capability for GCAP’s core platform is not simple. Yet, a crucial feature will be the ability to counter potential adversaries, with China being the primary concern due to its growing industrial prowess. Russia’s capabilities in ground-based air defence should not be under-estimated, but overall, given that defence is looking to science and civil-origin technology for major advances, it seems clear that China will overtake Russia across the board in defence by 2035, if not well before. China’s trading record suggests an increasingly assertive stance towards the West, with a readiness to sell its military products to those hostile to the West, including Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the GCAP partners, it is vital to develop a platform capable of dealing with the envisaged capabilities of anticipated adversaries post-2035, particularly those of China. Such a product would satisfy the MoD’s current concept of a “minimum deployable capability”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second core requirement to counter future evolving threats is for the system to be an “open system” susceptible to spiral and even continuous development. For GCAP specifically, the MoD has embraced this iterative development with its adoption of the PYRAMID Open Mission System, an open systems approach that will make upgrades more rapid and reduce software maintenance costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the terms “open system” or “modular system” are always easy to say but often difficult to deliver, and they do not come without challenges. Engineers must ensure sufficient power, propulsion and internal space for upgrades beyond the minimum deployable capability. While a minimum deployable capability is clear, the route to achieving it requires careful consideration, ideally with flexibility to adapt as knowledge advances. However, while this approach is welcomed, it will be important to assess the extent to which spiral development and open system architecture allow for national customisation, and how much divergence can be permitted without endangering programme coherence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the “open system” to develop and thrive, a healthy government–industry collaboration in each of the partner countries is crucial. This would allow for dynamic adjustments to project requirements based on evolving technology and threat assessments. The Government Accountability Office in the US has long advocated a knowledge-based approach to defence acquisition, where harder commitments are specified only as knowledge is advanced. This was not the case with the F-35 which subsequently suffered multiple delays and cost overruns. Furthermore, the issue extends to government–private sector relations, where the UK and US aim to possess the intellectual property for system modifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of spring 2024, significant progress can be observed, as evidenced by two key developments. Firstly, the signing of the treaty establishing the GCAP International Government Organisation signifies a notable milestone, cementing the commitment among the three partner countries and laying down governing structures for the programme’s progression. Secondly, and relevant to the capability aspects addressed in this article, consensus has been reached by the three countries on an initial system requirement document. This not only indicates a robust collaborative approach, but also shows considerable advancement in delineating the characteristics of the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid these achievements, several complexities and challenges remain. The establishment of an industry delivery structure stands as a crucial yet pending task. It would be reassuring if this structure is announced by the end of the year, and delays beyond this point could pose concerns. Additionally, there are important issues that will have to be addressed such as in-service support arrangements, security and vetting considerations for personnel (especially in light of recent Chinese espionage cases), exports arrangements and potential collaboration with third countries on sub-systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The success of GCAP hinges not only on the development of the aircraft itself, but also on avoiding “conspiracies of optimism” and addressing problems collaboratively as they emerge. The challenges and opportunities outlined in this article can inform the GCAP partners in their next steps towards 2035. Effective programme management, including timely decision-making, will be pivotal to realising the vision of the GCAP team.&lt;/p&gt;

This piece outlines five key issues this strategy should address.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most recent U.S. national security supplemental package to Ukraine, passed in April 2024, mandates the administration under President Joe Biden produce a strategy for continued U.S. support of Ukraine against Russian aggression. The strategy must “help Ukraine end the conflict as a democratic, independent, and sovereign country capable of deterring and defending its territory.” This white paper is intended to support the development of such a strategy by defining five key strategic problems: (1) integrating Ukraine into the European economic and transatlantic security order, (2) degrading Russia’s continued ability to bypass sanctions and access capital, (3) combating the resilience of Russian disinformation campaigns, (4) rethinking the arsenal of democracy, and (5) sustaining and strengthening Ukraine’s economy and democracy (Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ice5BPu.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Five Strategic Problems Relevant to U.S. Support for Ukraine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To succeed, the strategy must have bipartisan buy-in and be effectively messaged, both to the congressional committees of jurisdiction as required by statute and to the American people. Absent public support, Russia will win. The Russian regime possesses the key advantage of autocracies: the ability to play the long game, beholden not to the Russian people but rather to its political and military elites. Russian president Vladimir Putin is emboldened by the prospect of waning public support for Ukraine’s fight in the West. Rather than treat this as yet another time-consuming reporting requirement foisted upon overworked officials by Congress, the administration should seize the opportunity to craft a strategy that will lay the foundation for continued support for Ukraine for three to five years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;long-wars-require-strategic-vision&quot;&gt;Long Wars Require Strategic Vision&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The optimism that took hold after Ukraine held advancing Russian columns at bay in spring 2023 has given way to the reality of a longer war. The Russo-Ukrainian war is now longer and bloodier than 90 percent of all interstate wars in the last 200 years. Once attritional struggles cross this threshold, they last on average 962 days, or almost three years.[1] And the end is uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long wars have unique dynamics that require more focused planning and resourcing. Strategies for gaining an advantage in attritional campaigns need to follow the allure of battle and beware the myth of quick, decisive victories, which continues to plague most military and political thinking. An informed approach that incorporates lessons from past conflicts is more prudent than assumptions of swift success. Optimistic predictions can create information asymmetries, leading to miscalculations reminiscent of Ponzi schemes that promise rapid and substantial returns on investment but ultimately lose precious capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, stopping Russia in Ukraine requires a shift from the reactive approaches of the past two years to a more proactive strategy. This strategy should anticipate a conflict that may extend for another two to three years and prepare for the most substantial reconstruction effort in Europe since World War II. The plan must include a well-defined theory of victory and a vision for the postwar European security landscape that extends beyond Ukraine’s borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effective strategy begins with a comprehensive assessment of war and the desired outcomes. This analysis identifies key challenges that, if left untreated, will increase the disparity between the current state of conflict and the potential for peace and stability, not only in Europe but globally. It is only by starting with these problems that strategists can visualize and describe opportunities, key trade-offs, and how best to align ways (foreign policy options) and means (resources). As a result, this paper defines the most pressing problems the victory plan must address to ensure victory in Ukraine and a position of advantage in the anticipated post-conflict competition with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strategy-starts-with-a-clear-end-state&quot;&gt;Strategy Starts with a Clear End State&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Ukraine, the ideal end state appears clear: (1) restore its sovereign territory (i.e., the 1991 borders), (2) rebuild the country in a manner that promotes deeper Western integration, and (3) hold Russia accountable for war crimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether or not U.S. policymakers agree with this end state, it should serve as the foundation for any U.S. strategy. While the United States has now allocated over $175 billion in support of the war in Ukraine, it is not an American war. Most of the soldiers fighting and dying on the front lines are Ukrainian, not American or European. As such, U.S. policymakers should approach strategy formation with a sense of humility. There is almost certainly an ongoing debate within the Biden administration splitting those who would prefer Ukraine make concessions to avoid further escalation and more hawkish parties who see the fate of the international order at stake on the steppe battlefields in eastern and southern Ukraine. Regardless, a consensus likely exists around the need to support Ukraine in its defense against Russia, but with limits placed on attacks inside Russian territory with U.S. weapons to avoid further escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is unclear whether a coherent and well-coordinated strategy has guided U.S. support for Ukraine thus far. Although commendable for their swift response early in the conflict, Western efforts to maintain support for Ukraine appear ad hoc and less coordinated than optimal. It appears that transatlantic leaders face budget, time, and space constraints to forge a clear, deliberate theory of victory and a long-term plan to achieve it. These constraints have been evident since the start of the war. Reactive crisis management in Washington superseded strategy deliberation and focused on short-term (multi-month) solutions designed to manage escalation risks in lieu of the long-term (multi-year) planning required to ensure Ukraine wins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;For Ukraine, the ideal end state appears clear: (1) restore its sovereign territory (i.e., the 1991 borders), (2) rebuild the country in a manner that promotes deeper Western integration, and (3) hold Russia accountable for war crimes.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A comparison of the efforts to support Ukraine and the Allied planning conferences that predated World War II is revealing. Even before the United States formally entered the war, its top military leaders and strategists were already developing plans to defend Europe and create a new postwar order. There were five major planning conferences over two years before the United States formally entered World War II following the attack on Pearl Harbor. These conferences included core strategic framing documents like the 1940 Plan Dog memorandum prioritizing the European theater and the 1941 Atlantic Charter laying out a vision of postwar Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where are the equivalent documents guiding the current war in Ukraine? The formation of a Ukrainian Contact Group (UCG) and meetings at Ramstein Air Base designed to “help Ukraine win today and build strength for tomorrow” are only the start. The UCG currently lacks a multilaterally connected political framework focused on a long-term competitive strategy extending beyond the immediate necessity of keeping Ukraine on the battlefield. Furthermore, there appears to be a lack of unity of effort, both within individual governments and across the broader transatlantic network of states supporting Ukraine. There are reconstruction envoys and meetings du jour, but none appear backed by an overarching strategy with clear end states, objectives, or resourcing plans that extend beyond the short term. There are discussions about seizing frozen Russian assets, but they appear stuck in a dangerously long deliberation phase. In the end, the West appears to be muddling through and reacting to the latest crisis rather than setting conditions for Ukraine’s victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/i3YDw3S.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;crisis-response-is-not-a-strategy&quot;&gt;Crisis Response Is Not a Strategy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At best, crisis response is consequence management. It is firefighting and rushing to contain a burning building as opposed to taking the time to be the fire marshal and think about how to prevent fires and control future burns. Seen in this light, congressional leaders did the right thing by asking the Biden administration for a strategic vision for victory in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, it appears too much energy and political capital have been spent on debating escalation risks and securing immediate weapon stockpiles to keep Ukraine in the fight at the expense of developing a long-term strategy. The war in Gaza further set back long-term strategic thinking as the Biden administration found itself responding to two major theater wars involving multiple rivals while still maintaining sufficient forces to focus on deterrence in the Asia-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This logic of crisis response means weapons have been delivered piecemeal to Ukraine without a clear idea of the flow of resources over time, which directly limits the ability of the Ukrainian military to conduct long-term campaign planning. In June 2023, this tendency was on display when all energy and resources were focused on an unrealistic breakthrough of a triple defensive belt without air superiority. This campaign also did not plan for resources to help reconstitute the Ukrainian military for the next three years. Uncertain flows of aid are at the forefront in an almost endless series of reconstruction conferences that fail to produce binding documents or funding vehicles for an estimated 10-year, $486 billion effort to rebuild a country scarred by large-scale combat operations. These mistakes cannot continue, or they risk letting Russia win. Worse still, they set the stage for future wars in Europe and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;five-strategic-problems&quot;&gt;Five Strategic Problems&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transatlantic alliance has a unique opportunity to develop a long-term strategy for supporting Ukraine and containing Russia. As analysts who have spent time in Ukraine supporting efforts linked to ongoing hostilities, the authors see five core strategic problems that must be addressed as part of the new theory of victory the Biden administration produces in response to the directive in the national security supplemental.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-integrating-ukraine-into-the-european-economic-and-transatlantic-security-order&quot;&gt;1. Integrating Ukraine into the European Economic and Transatlantic Security Order&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way to secure lasting peace in Ukraine is to explore Ukraine’s path to a deeper relationship with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union. By taking steps to join both of these institutions over time, Ukraine will also strengthen its internal democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine applied for EU membership less than a week after Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. In December 2023, the European Council gave Ukraine candidate status and approved the commencement of accession negotiations. This is significant, as current EU members waited an average of 3.5 years from the time of their application to official approval of candidate status. There are 35 areas in which reforms are required to meet the conditions of membership, which range from food safety and justice to freedom and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While not an EU member, the United States should support Ukrainian aspirations to join the European Union by aligning its assistance to expedite the design and implementation of required reforms. The administration’s strategy should propose the key areas of reform, which the United States can play a leading role in supporting, and coordinate with the European Union and other donor countries to ensure complementary efforts. Combating corruption and tackling judicial reform seem to be sensible areas in which U.S. assistance can focus, given substantial support in these sectors to date. Through the supplemental packages, the United States has programmed critical dollars to assist in Ukraine’s efforts to combat corruption by supporting transparency and organizations such as the National Anticorruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) and the Specialized Anticorruption Prosecutor’s Office (SAPO) and by funding financial accountability platforms such as Prozorro and the Digital Restoration Ecosystem for Accountable Management (DREAM). The United States should also double down on investments to support judicial reform, a key requirement for EU membership and a continued challenge for combating corruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The only way to secure lasting peace in Ukraine is to explore Ukraine’s path to a deeper relationship with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the United States should use its diplomatic leverage to ensure the European Union adopts the negotiation framework for Ukraine prior to EU elections in June. Following the elections, Hungary will assume the presidency of the European Council. Given the Hungarian government’s ties with Russia, it is unlikely to make progress on Ukraine’s accession a priority. Even if EU membership for Ukraine is fast-tracked, many experts argue EU expansion will require treaty reform — a complicated and cumbersome process that many nations in the bloc will not be eager to undertake. However, this should not stop the push to ensure Ukraine meets the ambitious reform agenda to secure membership when the time is right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While EU membership would secure Ukraine’s economic future, the protection and durability of Ukraine’s postwar borders will require a multilateral security guarantee. NATO is the most obvious mechanism to provide such a guarantee. Ukrainian aspirations to join NATO predated Russia’s full-scale invasion. Members of the alliance first agreed Ukraine would become a member of NATO at the Bucharest summit in 2008. Those plans were put on pause from 2010 to 2014 when Ukraine adopted a policy of nonalignment under the leadership of pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych. Yanukovych was forced into exile amid pro-democracy protests in February 2014. Putin, sensing a threat to his influence in Ukraine, illegally annexed the Crimean peninsula, setting into motion a reinvigoration of Ukraine’s efforts to join the alliance. In 2017, the Ukrainian parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, adopted legislation confirming NATO membership as a strategic foreign policy and national security objective, which was followed by a corresponding amendment to the constitution. At the last NATO summit in Vilnius, the secretary general reaffirmed the commitment to expedite Ukrainian membership in NATO “when allies agree, and conditions are met.” The secretary general also stated that “unless Ukraine prevails there is no membership to be discussed at all.” These statements have left Ukraine without a clear set of criteria or timeline for NATO membership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next NATO summit is fast approaching. Heads of state, along with high-ranking foreign and defense officials, will convene in Washington, D.C., in early July. This summit will be particularly symbolic as it marks the 75th anniversary of the alliance and will be the first time in over a decade the United States will serve as host. While summits are often performative, the alliance should seize the opportunity to clearly lay out a detailed plan to support Ukraine’s victory and subsequent ascension to NATO even if it takes years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure broader regional security, the administration’s strategy for victory in Ukraine must consider its neighbors — notably, the former Soviet republic of Moldova. While other Ukrainian neighbors including Poland, Slovakia, Romania, and Hungary are in both the European Union and NATO, Moldova is more isolated. It shares a lengthy border with Ukraine and is within striking distance of Russian-occupied Crimea. It is also home to the breakaway province of Transnistria, which houses an unknown number of Russian troops. Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, NATO has continued to strengthen its relationship with Moldova. Building on the country’s 2022 membership application, Moldovans will go to the polls in fall 2024 to vote on a referendum to amend their constitution to state citizens’ desire to join the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To support Ukraine, the U.S. strategy should also support Moldova’s demonstrated desire to align more closely with the European Union and NATO. Russia is actively and openly interfering in Moldova’s presidential elections, slated to occur concurrently with the EU referendum. Should Russia succeed, this could open up yet another vector to destabilize Ukraine and the region. The Biden administration clearly recognizes the importance of Moldova, having channeled nearly $260 million to the nation of just 2.5 million in 2023 alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s neighbor to the north, Belarus, will continue to pose a challenge so long as pro-Russian president Aleksandr Lukashenko remains in power. The administration’s strategy must also contend with how to deal with this reclusive nation, which many view as a proxy state of Putin. However, Belarus experienced mass protests in 2020 signaling popular discontent with the despotic leader. While the charismatic opposition leader in exile, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, captured the attention of the West immediately following her surprise presidential candidacy in August 2020, attention on Belarus has slipped from the consciousness of many policymakers. The West became distracted as new crises emerged and Lukashenko appeared to consolidate power and suppress the opposition. However, to ensure regional stability, the Biden administration must contend not only with Russia but with Belarus as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any strategy for Ukraine must see Kyiv as part of a larger European security order that connects the Black Sea with Central and Eastern Europe. This geopolitical perspective should align programs designed to support civil society groups seeking reform in Belarus, protect Moldova from malign influence as its citizens decide on EU membership, and work with European partners to create optimal security guarantees for frontline states. Failing to take a regional perspective risks a victory in Ukraine becoming a stalemate for Europe as Moscow continues its delusional attempt to rebuild an old empire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-degrading-russias-ability-to-access-capital-and-bypass-sanctions&quot;&gt;2. Degrading Russia’s Ability to Access Capital and Bypass Sanctions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Roman statesman and philosopher Cicero, “Endless money forms the sinews of war.” In the modern world, this includes the ability to access high-tech components needed to make precision weapons. Despite Western sanctions, Moscow retains the ability to earn hard currency through oil exports, often facilitated through unregistered ghost ships and third-party refinery loopholes. In March, Chinese imports of Russian oil reached 2.55 million barrels per day, near the all-time high of 2.56 million barrels per day last June. Russia has displaced Saudi Arabia as China’s top supplier of oil. Based on data compiled by Bloomberg, the value of crude exports from Russia for one week in April reached $2.15 billion. While Asia is the primary destination for Russian crude oil, China is not the only country buying these shipments. India accounts for nearly half of the purchases of Russian oil over the past year. Turkey, a member of NATO, also purchases a substantial amount of Russian oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and allied countries must discern a way to cut off Russia’s cash flows. Pressure should be brought to bear on India and Turkey, in particular, to cease buying Russian oil. However, alternatives must be offered. All options should be on the table, including increasing liquified natural gas exports. In fact, the only way Washington can convince Ukraine to stop striking refinery targets deep inside Russia is by showing Kyiv alternatives for reducing Moscow’s cash flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the transatlantic community needs to develop better mechanisms for limiting Russia’s ability to import the critical electronic components required to expand its arsenal of authoritarianism. Modern precision-strike regimes and battle networks rely on microprocessors and other material inputs to pass targeting data to weapons. Russian military theory — from sixth-generation warfare to strategic operation for the destruction of critically important targets (SODCIT) — calls for using long-range precision fires to break enemy will. As a result, ensuring a steady supply of electronics is critical for Moscow’s war machine. No chips, no precision strike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite a wide range of Western sanctions, Moscow can still import the electronic precursors required to replenish its missile stockpiles. As a result, Russian factories are producing over 100 long-range precision ballistic and cruise missiles a month. These weapons force Ukraine to keep air defenses around Kyiv, further changing the air balance. Russia can attack Ukrainian forces along with the front and mass fires at different Ukrainian cities. And it is not just Russia: Iranian weapons supporting Moscow’s war often contain restricted electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and allied countries must discern a way to stop the flow of electronics in addition to creating barriers for future shipments. These efforts will require coordinating intelligence and law enforcement efforts to identify front companies used to facilitate Russia’s imports while also mapping the world of cryptocurrency exchanges used to finance illicit activity. It also necessitates considering new legislation that requires firms to keep better track of their sales, including in secondary markets. Despite U.S. secretary of state Antony Blinken’s recent trip, shaming China will not prove sufficient to stop the flow of weapons precursors fueling Moscow’s war machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-combating-the-resilience-of-russian-disinformation&quot;&gt;3. Combating the Resilience of Russian Disinformation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Old ideas about active measures and reflexive control live on in Putin’s Russia and form the core of cyber-enabled political warfare. Microsoft reported Russian network intrusion efforts in over 100 organizations in more than 40 countries outside Ukraine in the first year of the war, often linked to advanced persistent manipulator teams that specialize in planting false narratives across social media. These efforts persist with new campaigns like Maidan-3, designed to undermine confidence in Ukraine and its Western backers. Kremlin operatives also tried to use better-tailored deepfakes to amplify the civil-military tension in Kyiv over the reported differences between Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky and former top military leader General Valery Zaluzhny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Globally, Russia uses cyberspace to wage what researchers at the Atlantic Council call narrative warfare, designed to erode global confidence in Ukraine. Unlike traditional cyber intrusions, the goal is to either cause chaos or shape public attitudes toward the conflict using computational propaganda — creating fake social media accounts, using bots, and targeting content prompts to unique user groups to change public attitudes. This campaign is especially pronounced outside Europe, where the Kremlin seeks to limit global support for Ukraine. Both the Stanford Internet Observatory and BBC have documented extensive misinformation, disinformation, and malinformation campaigns in Africa designed to bolster support for Russia. These measures include not just cyber operations but more overt influence activities like offering low and no-cost access to RT, a known outlet for Russian propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even more disturbing are emerging — but unverified — reports that Russia is increasingly targeting the U.S. public. In April 2024, Microsoft claimed to have documented a new Russian online influence campaign. Using computational propaganda and traditional inform and influence activities, the campaign targeted both think tanks and the general public with content picked up and circulated by the D.C. Weekly and Miami Chronicle websites. The campaign uses doppelgängers — fake versions of real news websites in major democracies — to promote Kremlin themes and messages and even connect unsuspecting users to websites operated by Russian intelligence. Much of this content focuses not just on divisive issues in the United States but on Ukraine. According to Microsoft, “Messaging regarding Ukraine — via traditional media and social media — picked up steam over the last two months with a mix of covert and overt campaigns from at least 70 Russia-affiliated activity sets we track.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to these campaigns, Putin’s operatives are resurrecting their Soviet playbook to bribe, compromise, and exploit elected officials globally. In March 2024, a broad-reaching Russian influence campaign surfaced after the Czech government sanctioned a news site known as “Voice of Europe,” accused of being part of a pro-Russian propaganda network. In Belgium, Russian operatives paid members of the European Parliament to promote pro-Russian narratives and anti-Ukraine sentiments. The covert influence campaign funneled money to politicians from Germany, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Hungary, often through cryptocurrency exchanges, to influence elections for the European Parliament and reduce support for Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any U.S. strategy for victory in Ukraine must address the ease with which Moscow conducts covert influence campaigns and cyber-enabled information operations to distort discourse in free societies. Stopping Moscow from spreading lies and bribing elected officials should be a priority. Preventing the erosion of trust in democracies must become a central pillar of U.S. grand strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4-rethinking-the-arsenal-of-democracy&quot;&gt;4. Rethinking the Arsenal of Democracy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any U.S. strategy should also include rethinking how the United States builds weapons and supports its partners and allies. While efforts by a global network of democracies to arm Ukraine should be applauded, they cannot be sustained if these nations do not address the dismal state of their respective defense industrial bases. Russia has proved more capable of mobilizing resources than the world’s largest economies. NATO intelligence estimates Russia is producing three million munitions a year — three times more artillery shells than the United States and European Union produce to send to Ukraine. This rate of production is why Moscow is firing up to 10 times as many fire missions along the front line as Ukraine. It is also why Russia is expanding its attacks on Ukrainian critical infrastructure. As new missiles roll off the assembly line, Moscow can match them with imported Western electronics alongside Iranian drones and North Korean ballistic missiles to hold Ukrainian cities hostage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address this disparity, the United States must first move from a “stock” mindset to a “flow” mindset. To date, the focus has been on stockpiles, their location, and the impact of sending certain weapons on the broader inventory. But this stock mindset overlooks the importance of support for foreign partners in terms of the flows of key components through the supply chain to the battlefield. Seeing the problem in terms of flows means not just looking at inventories but asking how to accelerate production by considering everything from material sourcing to how regulatory frameworks limit the ability to build new facilities or work with foreign partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also means seeing networks instead of states. The United States cannot produce enough weapons for Ukraine while maintaining its capacity to address other contingencies, but Europe and the United States together can. Therefore, U.S. efforts should prioritize joint production agreements and accelerate the coordination already underway through the coalition system. That means not just replacing the weapons shipped to Ukraine but also changing the regulatory framework — from environmental policies to investment restrictions — that limits U.S. ability to build weapons with democratic partners and allies overseas. Through the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, the West has put in place international coalitions to supply weapons. Now it needs to change how it builds weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasing the flow of weapons to Ukraine will require a new emphasis on creativity and adaptation. For example, there are alternatives to producing traditional artillery rounds that could make any casting facility capable of helping address the shortage of 155 mm shells. The same applies to additive manufacturing, which can be used to make a diverse range of equipment closer to the front lines. U.S. assistance should incentivize more programs like “FrankenSAM,” which helped Ukraine combine legacy Soviet radars and launchers with NATO surface-to-air missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Ukraine has shown that the future of war resides in the use of multiple classes of networked unmanned systems to hold an adversary off balance. The proliferation of these systems has changed the battlefield. In the early stages of the war, teams of volunteer drone operators and special forces were instrumental in helping delay Russia’s advance on Kyiv. In the latest fighting in Ukraine along the eastern front, first-person-view drones (FPVs) and drone-dropped munitions accounted for around 90 percent of the wounded. Of note, these drones did not exist two years ago, showing the breathtaking speed of battlefield adaptation. According to former Ukrainian commander in chief General Zaluzhny, war has changed and created a new form of combined arms that integrates “radio-electronic environment control . . . [and] a combined operation using attack drones and cyber assets.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States can support this bottom-up military revolution by lowering costs for delivering components to Ukraine and supporting deeper defense integration to avoid duplicative resources and programs that could fall prey to corruption. Much of the battle network used to support Zaluzhny’s new war rests on commercial off-the-shelf hardware and software assembled in creative ways by Ukrainians. Accelerating that process means cutting through International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) restrictions and flooding Ukraine with the component parts it needs to keep producing drones and the battle networks that support them. This effort could include new ways of accelerating nontraditional and new defense entrants in the United States and using Ukraine as a battle lab for programs like the Replicator Initiative. Most important, it means using traditional security cooperation vehicles such as foreign military sales, direct sales, and other authorities to support indigenous efforts like Ukraine’s army of drones, a call to produce 1 million FPVs, and the creation of entirely new branches of service dedicated to the changing character of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;5-sustaining-ukraines-economy-and-strengthening-its-democracy&quot;&gt;5. Sustaining Ukraine’s Economy and Strengthening Its Democracy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the $175 billion appropriated to support Ukraine’s defense, over half has been dedicated to military support. A relatively small portion, nearly $31 billion, has gone to provide direct budget support (DBS) to the Ukrainian government to ensure it can fulfill basic obligations, such as paying teachers and healthcare workers. Such assistance is critical, as Ukraine is currently spending nearly 60 percent of its revenues, including foreign assistance, on defense. By comparison, the United States spent 12 percent of revenues on defense in fiscal year 2022. Sending military support to Ukraine will do little good if the United States stands by and allows the Ukrainian economy and state infrastructure to collapse. However, lawmakers have expressed wariness about economic assistance, as evinced by the 154 members of the House who voted in favor of an amendment to strike all nonmilitary assistance to Ukraine from the latest supplemental package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration’s strategy must contend with how to use limited resources to support the continued functioning of the Ukrainian economy. The economy has fared remarkably well under the circumstances. The International Monetary Fund projects a 3.2 percent increase in Ukrainian gross domestic product in 2024. To maintain the tax base needed to fund an active war, a robust economy is crucial. The ability to export goods to the international market, combat corruption, and enhance foreign investment are key to ensuring continued economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s gains in the Black Sea have been critical in this respect. While Ukrainian grain exports via the Black Sea have not reached the levels from before the full-scale Russian invasion, progress continues. In March 2024, 5.2 million tons of grain and maize were sent abroad compared to an average 6.5 million tons a month prior to February 2022. Securing Ukraine’s ability to export goods is a key area in which security and economic goals are inextricably linked. Of the five major Black Sea ports operational prior to the full-scale invasion, only three remain operational, and these have come under increased attack. Enhanced air defenses will protect not only Ukrainian civilians but also their livelihoods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, Ukraine has made significant progress in combating corruption despite simultaneously grappling with an active conflict within its borders. In 2015, Ukraine established NABU and SAPO. In 2023, NABU issued 238 official accusations and SAPO issued 100 indictments for charges of corruption, up from 131 and 56, respectively, in 2022. High-profile officials, including most recently the minister of agriculture, have been implicated. This demonstrates not an increase in corruption but a determination by the government to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse. Indeed, scores of public perceptions of corruption by Transparency International show a 10-point improvement over the past 10 years. U.S. support is critical to ensuring the government continues to make progress on reforms, which is key to increasing much-needed foreign investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasing foreign investment in Ukraine will not only help the economy during wartime but also ensure speedy recovery and reconstruction following the conclusion of the war. Presently, obtaining war insurance remains a major barrier for U.S. firms seeking to enter the Ukrainian market. Given the risks, financing remains scant for those who seek to do business in Ukraine. Proposals to confront these challenges include more nuanced risk mapping of the country by the State Department and the creation of a U.S. government–backed risk pool for businesses using interest from frozen Russian assets. As such, the administration’s strategy document should lay out steps to increase U.S. investment. Late in 2023, the Biden administration appointed former commerce secretary Penny Pritzker as the U.S. special representative for Ukraine’s economic recovery and gave her the mandate to accelerate Ukraine’s economic transformation. This position should be leveraged to develop strategies to confront these challenges in the congressionally mandated strategy document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A U.S. strategy should confront the oft-cited obstacles to increased private investment: rule of law, corruption, and political instability. These sectors are key not just to economic prosperity but also to the consolidation of democracy in Ukraine. In spite of the war, Ukraine is making great strides in these areas, bolstered by the quest to ensure long-term economic security through ascension to the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need for a U.S. strategy is urgent as Ukrainians are preparing for an anticipated Russian offensive this summer. The threat Putin’s despotic regime poses to the West has already crystallized in the string of recent arrests of Russian agents plotting violent acts of sabotage across Western Europe. The reality of the situation is that Ukraine will need further financial support beyond the most recent supplemental for continued defense and reconstruction activities. The strategy should be candid in this assessment while making clear the alternative — sending U.S. troops to Europe if Russia is not stopped in Ukraine — would be far more costly in blood and treasure. A one-time Ukraine skeptic, House speaker Mike Johnson stated: “To put it bluntly, I would rather send bullets to Ukraine than American boys.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the Biden administration is charged with writing the strategy, this is a task the administration and Congress must own jointly. In the days and weeks prior to the most recent vote on Ukraine assistance, Russian-linked media and online accounts sought to amplify narratives about the crisis on the U.S. southern border. By doing this, they aimed to embolden the argument that the United States should not spend money defending Ukraine’s borders but focus resources on its own borders. Russia capitalized on a similar narrative following the tragic wildfires in Hawaii in fall 2023 that suggested the United States was spending taxpayer dollars in Ukraine at the expense of disaster recovery at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These narratives have proved salient. Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Mike Turner stated, “We see directly coming from Russia . . . communications that are anti-Ukraine and pro-Russia messages, some of which we even hear being uttered on the House floor.” House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Michael McCaul noted that Russian propaganda has “infected a good chunk of my party’s base.” The U.S. public remains divided on Ukraine aid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The administration undoubtedly needs a strategy to communicate why supporting Ukraine is in the national security interest of the United States. Following the Russian invasion on February 24, 2022, President Biden did not address the nation on the importance of Ukraine until October 2023. However, members of Congress also bear this responsibility, as they are closer to their constituents and better positioned to make the case as to why Ukraine should matter to Americans living in places like Lima, Ohio, or Fort Worth, Texas. The 311 members of the House and 79 members of the Senate who voted in favor of the most recent national security supplemental package should go on the offensive and explain their support to their constituents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine requires more than U.S. financial and military assistance; it requires political leadership and courage. If Ukraine is to win the war against Russia, the most recent assistance package cannot be the last that Congress passes.&lt;/p&gt;

The countries that are able to secure their own supply chains for critical technologies will be in a position to write the rules of global economic governance for years to come.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-coming-chip-wars&quot;&gt;The Coming Chip Wars&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critical minerals are behind every modern technology, from the latest developments in commercial electronics to the strategic defense equipment required for national security; leading-node semiconductors require over 300 materials, presenting multiple vulnerabilities for adversaries to manipulate their supply. Given that these minerals are indispensable for semiconductors (and the equipment to manufacture them), countries are now more attentive to the necessity of shifting away from trade models that create dependency on strategic competitors. Instead, the United States has pursued a strategy of “friend-shoring” or “ally-shoring,” shifting production to friendlier nations with shared values that are less likely to wield trade as a weapon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s state-sponsored industrial policies, financing, and tax incentives have led to considerable political leverage worldwide over the raw materials required for semiconductor manufacturing; the country has positioned itself as the dominant supplier of raw material inputs for cutting-edge technology. Supply chains are fragile, especially for an industry characterized by its complexity, high-level expertise, and specialized manufacturing chains that cross international borders several times and depend on inputs from multiple private businesses and trusted suppliers. Self-sufficiency in the semiconductor industry is impractical and highly unlikely, but it is possible and desirable to diminish risks and increase resiliency. U.S. allies in the Western Hemisphere are crucial for this undertaking, and the United States should look at all segments of the value chain for the region, not just at assembly, testing, and packaging (ATP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reliance-on-china-as-a-strategic-vulnerability&quot;&gt;Reliance on China as a Strategic Vulnerability&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The semiconductor industry is expected to be worth $1 trillion annually by 2030. Increased demand for semiconductors, especially those at the cutting edge of advanced design and capability, will require greater quantities and new varieties of minerals and metals of all types. China’s concentration — bordering on monopoly — of supply and production of critical minerals creates a vulnerability, leaving the industry exposed to supply chain disruptions. The International Energy Agency claims that China maintains 60 percent of the world’s rare earth mining production and approximately 90 percent of processing and refining. The West’s reliance on China’s minerals poses worrisome risks of supply shocks and China exercising its leverage over prices. A secure supply of critical minerals for the semiconductor industry is not only necessary for the private sector but also a concern for national security and defense; since 2020, the United States has recognized it has no domestic production of 14 of the minerals on the critical minerals list and is “completely dependent on imports to supply its demand.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A detailed understanding of the risks associated with each material involved in semiconductor production is crucial to appreciating and measuring vulnerability. Dependence on China varies considerably for each critical mineral. Moreover, vulnerability should not be calculated merely by possible manipulations of supply but rather by the mineral’s sensitivity to price shifts; the availability of stockpiles, alternative suppliers, and substitute materials; and how quickly alternative production could be brought online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-actions&quot;&gt;China’s Actions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is highly reliant on chip imports from its geopolitical rivals to drive its domestic design and production. Aware of this vulnerability in its tech sector, the PRC has pursued policies to become more self-reliant in the semiconductor industry. In part, this national effort is spurred by the “information innovation” project, launched in 2016 and expanded significantly in 2022, and aims to reduce dependence on technology suppliers from abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2014, the PRC released a policy addressing semiconductors as a core technology. The “Guidelines to Promote National Integrated Circuit Industry Development” indicate “the goal of establishing a world-leading semiconductor industry in all areas of the integrated circuit supply chain by 2030.” As a stated objective, the strategy includes meeting 70 percent of the PRC’s semiconductor demand through domestic production by 2025. In response to U.S. efforts to build a multinational coalition to restrict its access to advanced semiconductor manufacturing technology, China increased its imports of lithography machines used to imprint circuits in silicon wafers by 450 percent in December 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responding to new U.S. export controls on chip manufacturing technology in October 2022 and additional controls in October 2023, the PRC has also increased subsidies to boost the domestic semiconductor industry — totaling an estimated $150 billion in the past decade. In March 2023, Huawei and the Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) spearheaded a technology initiative that managed to produce new chips “at the advanced 7-nanometer (nm) technology node” for the Mate60 Pro smartphone; SMIC, a partially state-owned company, is allegedly capable of creating 5 nm chips, though likely not yet at industrial scale. This has raised questions in the U.S. government about the effectiveness of technology export controls since China has nevertheless advanced in the semiconductor industry. For example, Beijing has prioritized “tool and material production lines free of Western inputs” and new approaches to lay out public-private collaboration to enhance innovation, mostly in advanced lithography technology. Yet despite the narrowing gap in technological advancement, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) continues to outpace its PRC competitors and rivals, as it has been producing 3 nm chips at industrial scale since 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, again as a direct response to U.S. export controls, the PRC has leveraged its dominance in the early stages of supply chains to restrict exports of gallium, germanium, and graphite, which are essential to high-performance chips. In July 2023, alleging national security concerns, China announced the restrictions, which took the form of licensing requirements that mandate exporters first apply for permission from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce. Rather than outright banning exports, China would therefore be able to selectively increase or decrease the flow of gallium and germanium to world markets. While gallium exports remain at historic lows, the PRC has seemingly not sought to choke off U.S. access to the metal completely, taking a “presumption of approval” approach to licensing exports. However, concerns persist that this could rapidly switch to a “presumption of denial” for gallium and a host of other minerals and technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-united-states-responds&quot;&gt;The United States Responds&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September 2020, the Trump administration recognized in an executive order that “America cannot be dependent on imports from foreign adversaries for the critical minerals that are increasingly necessary to maintain our economic and military strength in the 21st century.” The United States has further recognized the supply chain vulnerabilities and geopolitical risks of its dependence on China for critical minerals, with the Biden administration clamping down on China’s access to advanced chip technology and imposing export restrictions intended to flag its military advancement. Part of this acknowledgment was spearheaded by the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, signed into law by President Joe Biden that August and designed to boost U.S. investment and development. Two months later, the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) imposed trade restrictions to cap China’s access to the most advanced semiconductors by limiting access to design capability and manufacturing, blocking expert assistance, scrutinizing investments, or narrowing licensing. The restrictions were “substantially tightened” in October 2023 with measures such as preventing circumvention efforts through subsidiary companies, adding items to the list of manufacturing equipment for chips, or blacklisting companies “to which the export of certain technology is prohibited.” Most recently, the Department of Commerce revoked the licenses that major U.S. chipmakers Intel and Qualcomm relied upon to export semiconductors to Huawei. Establishing export controls to halt the advance of Chinese technology companies is a tactic intended to work in tandem with the stimulus of domestic manufacturing and nearshoring. Alongside the CHIPS and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) sought to catalyze a reorientation of mineral supply chains away from China and toward the United States and other like-minded countries in the Western Hemisphere through tax credits and subsidies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another policy to address the United States’ unsustainable vulnerability is the entry into force of the Minerals Security Partnership, a strategic, U.S.-led alliance that endeavors to diversify the sources of mineral supply. The interconnectedness of semiconductor supply chains has emphasized that the partnership is not comprehensive enough, especially because it does not include “key mineral producers” in the Western Hemisphere such as Argentina and Brazil. Reducing risks in supply chains is challenging, and regulatory and practical obstacles exist among Western allies. For example, just in the United States, the challenge of U.S. higher labor costs vis-à-vis competitors is one of the barriers to relocating industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;surveying-the-bottlenecks-and-defining-disruption-potential&quot;&gt;Surveying the Bottlenecks and Defining “Disruption Potential”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While China’s dominance over critical mineral supply chains has prompted concern from several corners of the U.S. government and private sector, understanding the nature of the threat is not entirely straightforward. Wielding coercive power through export restrictions, even when those exports are going toward an industry as globally important as semiconductors, is no easy task. Export restrictions are a blunt tool, and both governments and companies are more likely to adapt than cave to political pressures, at least if adaptation is possible in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case of neon gas is especially instructive in this regard. Used as a buffer in the lasers responsible for the deep- and extreme-ultraviolet lithography responsible for advanced chipmaking, the neon industry was highly concentrated in Russia and Ukraine until recently. Moscow’s full-scale invasion in February 2022 brought neon production in both countries to a crawl, cutting off as much as 40–50 percent of global supply. Neon gas prices subsequently surged, alongside those of other rare gases such as xenon and krypton, which also depended heavily on Ukrainian and Russian sources. Notably, however, this did not bring about a significant market distortion in the semiconductor industry, where major producers were able to employ existing reserves and adapt their lithography processes to use less neon. Just a year later, neon prices had practically returned to their prewar levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the neon shortage was an unintentional consequence of Russia’s revisionist foreign policy, even premeditated attempts to deploy critical minerals as a weapon in geopolitical competition can backfire on their wielders. One CSIS study found that in many cases, China’s attempts at economic coercion have proven counterproductive to Beijing’s strategic aims. In 2010, after a Chinese fishing vessel collided with the Japanese coast guard off the disputed Senkaku Islands, the PRC halted rare earth element (REE) exports to Japan. In response, the Japanese government created a budget of $1.2 billion devoted to mitigating its dependence on Chinese REEs. This fund supported investment in the use of alternative materials, recycling and stockpiling of REEs, and acquiring a stake in REE mines in friendly countries such as Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Past success at thwarting China’s economic coercion does not mean the United States and its allies should be cavalier about the ability to adapt should China’s posture change from its current presumption of approval to a presumption of denial for exporting critical minerals. To the contrary, governments and chip manufacturers need to use a more fine-grained approach when surveying vulnerabilities in their mineral supply chains. Rather than looking at market dominance alone, “disruption potential” serves as a more promising standard. This framework was originally used by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to synthesize the United States’ dependency on imports for a particular mineral and the estimated economic value that mineral provides. Applied to semiconductor manufacturing, inputs with the highest disruption potential are defined as those for which supply is highly concentrated in China and for which there are few to no readily available substitutes or alternative suppliers. The subsequent section evaluates five materials according to this definition of disruption potential: gallium, germanium, fluorine, arsenic, and copper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This list is illustrative, not comprehensive. It encompasses elements that are common to virtually all semiconductors, such as fluorine and copper, as well as those needed for specialty chips. Gallium, germanium, and arsenic in particular are widespread among the semiconductors serving national defense functions, including missile defense radars, high-frequency radio, and satellite communications. However, a more fulsome accounting is necessary to map the expansive supply chain for semiconductor minerals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Azxu6vk.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;gallium&quot;&gt;Gallium&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the most well-known semiconductor minerals, second only to silicon, gallium has been the topic of extensive coverage following China’s announcement of export controls in August 2023. Gallium wafers are used in lieu of silicon for “wide-bandgap” semiconductors, characterized by their resistance to high temperatures and ability to handle higher voltages and frequencies. Wide-bandgap semiconductors are especially sought after for defense applications (their size and efficiency being key to modern radars), telecommunications (especially 5G networks), and electric vehicles. Demand for gallium nitride (GaN) for the most advanced commercially available gallium-based semiconductors is projected to grow approximately 25 percent on average over the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gallium supply is overwhelmingly concentrated in China’s hands, with 98 percent of unprocessed gallium and 86 percent of total gallium coming from the PRC in 2022. China’s control over gallium is emblematic of Beijing’s broader critical minerals strategy, which seeks to dominate the midstream processing and refining stages of production. Raw gallium is a byproduct of bauxite processing, the primary ore for producing aluminum, of which China accounts for nearly 60 percent of global supply. Thus, while China has less than half the bauxite reserves of Brazil, and less than one-fifth of those of Australia, its willingness to shoulder the environmental externalities that come with mineral processing has provided an unexpected geopolitical edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disruption Potential: High&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gallium has the highest disruption potential of any semiconductor material. Finding alternative sources is dependent upon access to not only bauxite but also smelters capable of recovering gallium from aluminum production. The United States has just four primary aluminum smelters still in operation, while most smelters in Brazil, a country with sizeable reserves, have shuttered their production, unable to compete with China. Disruption potential is exacerbated by the fact that China has dramatically increased investment into its domestic semiconductor industry to advance GaN-based chip production. If the PRC succeeds in taking the lead in advanced semiconductor production using gallium-based chips, it will be able to restrict U.S. access to cutting-edge technology on two fronts, first in the finished products themselves and second in the raw materials needed to produce them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Substitutes for gallium in wide-bandgap semiconductors do exist, notably in the form of silicon carbide (SiC). However, these chips have different performance characteristics, and the near ubiquity of GaN semiconductors in certain sectors (especially defense technologies) would pose a major logistical challenge to merely replacing these chips with ones made from another material. China’s export controls have already made an impact in this regard, with the price of gallium metal more than doubling since July 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/c2utXbJ.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;germanium&quot;&gt;Germanium&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like gallium, germanium wafers can be used as substitutes for silicon in semiconductor technology. Germanium, too, boasts greater thermal resistance, making germanium-based chips suitable for high-performance electronics. Germanium is viewed as a possible solution to the ever-growing desire for smaller and smaller semiconductors. As a material, it boasts significantly higher electron mobility than silicon, allowing devices to wring greater power out of a chip of the same size. Germanium is already used in minute amounts as part of silicon chips to help improve electron mobility, and as the chip industry searches for new avenues to meet the future requirements for increased processing power, its prominence could rise substantially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Germanium is produced either as a byproduct of coal or from zinc production, with China dominating the latter as the source of roughly 65 percent of germanium worldwide. At present, the global germanium market is miniscule, with USGS estimates recording just 140 metric tons of primary production in 2021. By comparison, primary production of gallium was more than three times larger during the same period. Of this relatively small total production, much of this is used for applications such as infrared imaging and fiber optics, with only a small percentage going toward semiconductors. The marginal size of the semiconductor-grade germanium market, coupled with China’s considerable zinc-refining industry, means the PRC is likely sitting on an overproduction of germanium, allowing it to keep prices for the mineral artificially low while maintaining comfortable reserves of its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disruption Potential: Moderate to High&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Germanium occupies a niche but important role in the modern semiconductor industry. Disruption to supply would create problems for certain specialized chips that could potentially reverberate throughout the wider market. While supply is less concentrated in China than in the case of gallium, with important germanium producers located in Canada, low prices mean smelters have little incentive to increase their production. The lack of transparency into China’s minerals sector has generated consternation over Beijing’s ability to flood the market and outprice competitors, a relatively easy feat given the small market size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, while other producers of germanium are available, most do not currently have the capacity to meet the full market demand and have little incentive to build excess capacity so long as prices remain low. If germanium rises in importance for future advanced chips, the risk posed by China’s position in the market will grow. Furthermore, should China pursue a strategy of bundling export restrictions on semiconductor minerals, such as cutting off both gallium and germanium at once, the combined economic impact may be felt more acutely, as chipmakers will have fewer substitutes to turn toward for high-performance materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;fluorine&quot;&gt;Fluorine&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fluorine differs from the other materials considered here in that it does not make up a part of the final chip but is instead an essential input into the chip manufacturing process. Hydrogen fluoride (HF), produced through mining fluorite (also known as fluorspar), is essential both in the etching process for semiconductors and for removing impurities from the final chip. HF is especially valuable for its ability to dissolve the silicon wafer that comprises much of the semiconductor with the required precision to complete the electrical interconnections that allow the chip to function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for the United States, the world’s largest fluorspar mine is located in San Luis Potosí, Mexico, creating a strong proximity and trade advantage — including eligibility for IRA tax credits — while ensuring adequate supply to meet semiconductor demand. However, China retains a preeminent position both in mining raw fluorspar and producing HF. It is the source of approximately 63 percent of global fluorspar, with many semiconductor manufacturers throughout East Asia relying on Beijing for a sizeable portion of their supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disruption Potential: Moderate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If HF access were significantly constrained, there are few readily available substitutes that would be economical to use in semiconductor manufacturing, potentially snarling production timelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, HF supply chains have already been the subject of geopolitical contention. In 2019, Japan restricted exports of HF to South Korea in retaliation for a Korean court order seeking reparations from Japanese companies found to have engaged in forced labor during World War II. These export controls did not significantly affect the Korean semiconductor industry, which supplanted Japanese HF with domestic production and, more significantly, diversified its import sources. The downsides to both policy measures, however, were a significant uptick in South Korea’s dependence on China for HF. Furthermore, experts raised concerns regarding the relative quality of South Korea’s domestic HF vis-à-vis international suppliers. This episode is instructive for two reasons. First, it highlights the potential resiliency of semiconductor supply chains, at least provided substitute sources exist and can be integrated effectively into fabrication processes. Second, concerns over the quality of South Korean HF underscore the semiconductor industry’s risk aversion to “unvetted” suppliers and preference for dealing with well-established vendors in the chips sector — an important barrier to bringing supply back online quickly in the event of a disruption. Notably, South Korean HF exports remain low outside of China and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;arsenic&quot;&gt;Arsenic&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High-purity arsenic metal is primarily used in conjunction with gallium to produce gallium arsenide (GaA) wafers. The technology to produce these wafers can trace its origins to U.S. defense industrial production in the 1970s. Today, GaA wafers have been eclipsed in certain regards by true wide-bandgap semiconductors such as GaN-based ones but nevertheless remain a popular choice for many industries, with demand projected to grow over the coming years. Indeed, the vast majority of U.S. gallium imports come in the form of GaA wafers, whose higher radiation and temperature resistance has seen these chips used for a range of specialized applications from defense to telecommunications. GaA semiconductors are especially useful in LEDs, a sector which is forecast to drive demand through 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arsenic is also used for “doping” silicon — introducing arsenic atoms to the pure silicon to grant the resulting material unique, electrically conductive properties. While arsenic is a plentiful element, it is typically created as a byproduct of extracting and processing copper and gold. The high toxicity of arsenic to humans means these byproducts have little commercial use without the requisite facilities to safely handle and process arsenic metal, an undertaking in which few countries or companies have the desire to invest. Indeed, major copper and gold producers in the Western Hemisphere such as Chile and Peru have seen widespread outcry over arsenic contamination of water and soil as a consequence of their mining activities. China, however, has successfully built up a robust arsenic industry and in 2022 accounted for 95 percent of all U.S. arsenic metal imports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disruption Potential: Moderate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rising popularity of GaN for defense industrial purposes has limited the national security relevance of GaA. However, any restriction on Chinese arsenic exports could be paired with restrictions on gallium, a move that would have substantial ramifications for U.S. and allied chip supplies. The greatest disruption potential arises from the use of arsenic for doping purposes, since the atomic makeup of arsenic allows it to influence the properties of semiconductors in unique ways, with few available substitutes. Nevertheless, arsenic is plentiful enough as a resource, and Japan in particular possesses substantial technical know-how to produce high-purity arsenic metal, meaning markets could likely react to a loss of Chinese supply in time to avert major market distortions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;copper&quot;&gt;Copper&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copper is the industry standard for semiconductor interconnects, the microscopic wires responsible for connecting billions of transistors into the single integrated circuit that forms the backbone of modern computing power. Copper’s conductivity and flexibility make it ideally suited for this role. Indeed, when the first integrated circuit manufactured using copper was unveiled in 1997, it was estimated that this change alone helped increase microprocessor speeds by as much as 15 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copper’s importance in electrical applications extends well beyond the semiconductor industry. Demand for copper is predicted to skyrocket by 2050, driven most notably by the energy transition. According to some estimates, achieving net-zero emissions targets will require as much new copper as humanity has produced in all recorded history. Of this massive increase in copper demand, semiconductors will consume a fractional amount. Still, given the vital role the metal plays in modern chips, it remains important to account for possible vulnerabilities in the copper supply chain. Here China again dominates the midstream, and while the PRC’s copper reserves pale in comparison to those of mining powerhouses such as Chile and Peru, China’s dominance in refining and processing means these countries often ship their raw copper outputs across the Pacific to be converted into a workable final state. This allows China to punch well above its weight in global copper supply chains and, critically, keeps copper-rich countries from progressing further into value-added industries such as advanced refining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disruption Potential: Low&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copper is unlikely to present a bottleneck for semiconductor manufacturing. The sheer size of the copper market means that for China to meaningfully restrict access to copper for semiconductors, it would need to virtually cease all its copper exports. Meanwhile, chip manufacturers would likely be able to adapt swiftly either by procuring copper from alternative refinery countries or exploring substitution with other minerals. Finally, copper’s recyclability means much of a demand shortfall could be compensated by simply reclaiming materials from old chips. Accordingly, any move to restrict copper supply by China would likely deal far more damage to China than it would to U.S. and allied semiconductor production. For now, copper does not feature on the official critical minerals list — the subject of substantial debate — but a move by China to restrict exports would earn copper a spot on the list rather quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/BWJtIfs.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The complexity of modern chips and the ever-evolving chemistry of cutting-edge semiconductor manufacturing mean that a truly dizzying array of inputs are employed at every stage of production. The disruption potential analysis is encouraging, however, insofar as it demonstrates the surprising resiliency of many of these mineral supply chains. Apart from gallium and germanium, most mineral supplies have either moderate or low disruption potential. Nevertheless, supply chains for the minerals examined have a strong nexus in the PRC, granting China considerable freedom to manipulate its export controls across a range of material inputs, scaling up or down in accordance with its objectives. Building resiliency into semiconductor supply chains will require tapping into new networks of U.S. allies. In this respect, the Western Hemisphere plays an important but often overlooked role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bringing-in-the-western-hemisphere&quot;&gt;Bringing In the Western Hemisphere&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Western Hemisphere’s role in meeting future demand for critical minerals is increasingly evident. From copper and lithium to significant REE deposits, the region will be vital in fueling the energy transition and supplying the inputs for new technologies. Notably, it has the latent potential to supply all five of the mineral inputs discussed above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hemisphere’s bauxite reserves are far larger than China’s. Brazil is the world’s fourth-largest producer of bauxite; Jamaica, with an estimated 2 billion metric tons of high-quality bauxite reserves, has seen its industry grow dramatically in recent years, becoming the seventh-largest producer in 2022. The challenge in this case is not one of production but of developing the requisite processing capacity to recover gallium within the Western Hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/DsIP3YO.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of China, Canada and Mexico are among the largest producers of germanium and fluorspar, respectively. Teck Resources is already engaged in germanium recovery from its smelting operations in British Columbia, while the Las Cuevas mine in Mexico singlehandedly generates 18 percent of the world’s fluorspar production. Firms in both countries benefit from close trade integration with the United States through the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), making them natural candidates for strengthening semiconductor-critical mineral supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peru and Chile together account for over a third of total copper production. These copper deposits are often situated near large quantities of arsenic, with Peru in particular identified by the USGS as the largest producer of arsenic trioxide in the world. While neither country possesses the capability at present to produce high-purity arsenic, developing a safe and robust arsenic industry could not only benefit supply chain security but also alleviate some of the environmental hazards associated with copper production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, beyond the resources listed above, the hemisphere’s mineral wealth encompasses a host of other semiconductor-critical inputs. For instance, Brazil possesses an estimated 22 percent of graphite reserves and 17 percent of global REE reserves, both of which are key inputs for chipmaking equipment, including high-purity graphite crucibles and specialized lithography lasers. Brazil’s potential in this space remains locked behind a lack of both new mining and investment in advanced refining needed to process minerals to the required degree of purity. As advances in chip design unlock new processes and manufacturing requirements, it is difficult to predict which materials may come into vogue for the next generation of semiconductors. For this reason, ensuring that like-minded countries maintain the expertise and technical capacity to recover the necessary inputs will be critical for the United States to maintain its qualitative edge in advanced semiconductor design and construction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the hemisphere, the question of semiconductor mineral supplies is one of processing and refining. Gallium, germanium, and arsenic are all generated as byproducts from processing other minerals, while the relatively small quantities used to manufacture chips means it does not require substantial production in absolute terms to make a major impact on the ecosystem. Bolstering refinery capacity may also allow resource-rich countries to climb higher on the value chain by exporting high-purity minerals as opposed to raw outputs destined for Chinese refineries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;obstacles-persist&quot;&gt;Obstacles Persist&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greater supply chain resiliency implies and presupposes two converging interests: an intention to reduce risks for the incoming company and a positive outcome or gain for the receiving country. These two conditions do not necessarily always meet. Given the complexity of social and political dynamics in the region, countries in the Western Hemisphere epitomize this challenge. Although the hemisphere has the potential to serve as an alternative to China and reduce certain risks in semiconductor supply chains, especially in related mining and processing, stakeholders should anticipate some resistance and backlash from local communities and political authorities. In short, increasing mineral production and processing will be no easy feat for a region looking to shed a legacy of commodity dependence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The region certainly embodies an opportunity to mitigate risk — but the benefits countries can obtain from greater supply chain security need to be communicated better. Other benefits include opportunities for workforce training and development, foreign direct investment, addressing inequality in certain areas, increasing tax revenue, reducing irregular migration, and growing local economies. An expanded role for the Western Hemisphere cannot be separated from an effective communication strategy that constantly promotes a dialogue between businesses and impacted communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various political movements in the Western Hemisphere have historically identified themselves as obstacles to “extractivism,” representing strong political backlash. These cultural and ideological barriers persist within the hemisphere’s political environment and should be taken into consideration. The resistance to exporting raw materials in many regional countries has, on more than one occasion, underpinned the nationalization of strategic sectors of the economy because “higher prices for commodities favor resource nationalism.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to these ideological and political obstacles, the mining sector and the redrawing of supply chains have generated concern about local environmental impacts. These industries are not only highly polluting, they also require large amounts of other resources such as water and electricity. In many instances, considerable improvements have been implemented in recent years to address these ecological considerations and Indigenous people’s rights. However, countries with low environmental standards might have a comparative advantage in the short term: the inability of the Western Hemisphere to shoulder the environmental externalities assists not only China but any other countries willing to accept the pollution and associated costs with mineral processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the Western Hemisphere may not be ready yet to alleviate existing chokepoints, it can help address the current challenge. Due to its rich mineral reserves and highly skilled workforce, the region is of utmost importance for any successful de-risking strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;policy-recommendations&quot;&gt;Policy Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rerouting mineral supply chains for semiconductors will not happen overnight. Fortunately, China’s announcement of export restrictions has provided an early warning of the need to move quickly — but without significantly curtailing access to the necessary mineral inputs. A future U.S. strategy should emphasize multilateral coordination to friend-shore processing capacity, substitute critical mineral suppliers, stockpile for both defense and economic security needs, and survey for new and untapped sources of semiconductor-critical minerals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Processing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s privileged position in the semiconductor minerals supply chain is due not to its innate resource wealth but to its dominance in the realm of smelting, refining, and processing. Bringing processing capabilities back to the Western Hemisphere therefore promises not only to help counteract China’s influence over semiconductor supply chains but also to allow Latin American countries to advance in the value-added manufacturing space. Whereas countries such as Chile, Peru, and Brazil currently export much of their raw minerals to China for further processing, building up the domestic refinery capabilities in these countries would allow them to export finished materials. In areas such as high-purity arsenic production, it could even allow countries to break into otherwise-untapped new sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encouraging training and knowledge transfer on high-purity refining for semiconductor manufacturing could be one underappreciated element of the U.S. Department of State’s International Technology Security and Innovation (ITSI) Fund. This agreement has focused primarily on workforce development to make the most of limited available funds. Improving knowledge of mineral processing could therefore be a natural extension of ongoing projects that would find purchase in ISTI partner countries such as the Dominican Republic, which already has a robust mining industry. Upscaling mineral processing also goes hand-in-hand with incentives laid out by the IRA, which prioritizes critical minerals originating in countries with free trade agreements (FTAs) with the United States, a category that includes a dozen Western Hemisphere nations. Extending IRA tax credits to include microelectronics produced using minerals from FTA countries could send a powerful signal to further encourage supply chain reorientation for these critical technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should prioritize existing smelting and refining infrastructure, both domestically and in partner countries. It is far easier to upgrade and expand infrastructure than to build new facilities from scratch. Nevertheless, as recently as January 2024 one of the five remaining aluminum smelters in the United States shuttered its Missouri facility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Substituting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two avenues for substituting Chinese-sourced critical minerals. First, the United States and chip manufacturers can look into alternative materials that can fulfill similar requirements in semiconductor design but are not so heavily controlled by the PRC. Encouraging research and development into potential alternatives could present another impactful deployment of ITSI funds with a salutary effect on supply chain security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the United States should seek to identify and connect alternative suppliers with chipmakers who can substitute in for Chinese sources. This latter dimension is perhaps even more critical, as the chip industry’s winner-take-all environment means manufacturers tend to build relationships with just a handful of highly specialized vendors and are strongly risk-averse to new supply sources. According to one analysis, just five companies account for 99 percent of the profits from semiconductor manufacturing equipment sales. The United States can spearhead an international effort to identify, vet, and connect alternative suppliers to semiconductor manufacturers in an effort to subvert this tendency toward market concentration. Within the Western Hemisphere, the U.S. Department of Commerce, in conjunction with embassies throughout the region, can lead delegations from the semiconductor industry to materials suppliers. Bringing vendors and manufacturers closer together can help reassure the latter of the quality and benefits to be gained from diversifying their supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Stockpiling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Defense Stockpile (NDS) previously served as a contingency against potential disruptions to the flow of minerals needed for U.S. defense production. However, following the end of the Cold War, this stockpile has withered to a shadow of its former self. In 1989, the material in the NDS was worth an estimated $9.6 billion (more than $24 billion once adjusted for inflation). Today, it is just under $1 billion. Furthermore, semiconductor-critical minerals such as gallium are not included in the list of materials under management. Scaling up the NDS will be critical for U.S. security as a whole and especially for improving the resiliency of the semiconductor industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to building up national reserves such as the NDS, the United States should encourage semiconductor companies to maintain their own stockpiles. This would ease the reverberations of unexpected disruptions in the materials market and give breathing space for supply chains to reorient. The United States can also provide financial incentives for companies to increase their own stockpiles, such as by offering tax credits on the value of excess minerals purchased but not consumed in a given production year. There may even be potential for the U.S. government to offer to buy excess minerals supply from semiconductor manufacturers to contribute to a revitalized National Defense Stockpile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Surveying&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identifying new sources of minerals for semiconductors demands continued focus. In the Western Hemisphere, countries are investing growing sums to better understand the potential resources beneath their feet, a push that has led to impressive discoveries in both North and South America. This includes one of the world’s largest lithium deposits in the world in the U.S. Pacific Northwest, new REE finds across Brazil, and a rare nickel find in Canada. Nevertheless, gaps persist, especially in South America, where many surveys are either outdated or incomprehensive. The more countries conduct geological surveys, the more likely they are to discover further important reserves. Identifying these and bringing them online will be an important complement to increased processing capacity and help weaken China’s predominance in global minerals markets.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;辯方申重新傳召張劍虹出庭 就「飯盒會」紀錄盤問 官押後至周四宣布決定&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（14日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第76日審訊。辯方申請重召前《蘋果》社長張劍虹出庭作供，冀就通訊群組 Slack 內的「飯盒會」紀錄提問。辯方作口頭補充陳詞，指稱雖然證人供詞有提及過「飯盒會」，但是當中從沒提及會議紀錄存在；惟法官杜麗冰質疑黎智英本來是 Slack 群組的成員之一，辯方團隊沒有理由不知道 Slack 內有會議紀錄存在。法官押後至周四宣布是否批准重召張劍虹。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表黎智英的羅拔臣律師行合夥人兼事務律師何俊豪（Johnny Ho）昨日親自作供，他指控方證人供詞和文件中從未提及過「飯盒會」的會議重點會被上載至通訊軟件 Slack，直至今年1月29日，辯方庭上盤問張劍虹期間，張才首度提及 Slack。何指，辯方團隊遂於1月30日去信控方索取 Slack 群組的通訊紀錄；控方於2月1日以書信回覆稱沒有相關紀錄。其後辯方團隊嘗試以其他途徑取得過往的 Slack 紀錄，直至2月26日才透過黎智英的女兒 Claire Lai 取得。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方資深大律師彭耀鴻今陳詞指，雖然控方材料包含一張由張劍虹傳出的「飯盒會」會議重點截圖，但是證人供詞從沒提及這是來自 Slack 的截圖，因此不能說辯方可以就此自行調查。惟法官李運騰指，從表面上看，該截圖明顯是一些紀錄。彭則指，雖然證人供詞有提及過「飯盒會」，但是當中從沒提及會議紀錄存在。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官又問，辯方有否向當事人黎智英索取過指示，從而確認黎不知道「飯盒會」有任何會議紀錄。彭則回應，雖然不爭議黎是部份「飯盒會」的主持人，但是黎已還柙了數年，他無法接觸任何電子器材。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰打斷，指問題並非黎能否接觸電子器材，而是辯方在盤問張劍虹時率先向他指出，每次「飯盒會」之前，均會開設 Slack 聊天群組，因此辯方沒有理由不知道 Slack 紀錄存在。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭則表示，「見林不見樹」的情況時有出現，強調他並非指責控方或任何一方。杜官聞言激動地指，他們已經花費很多天、很多小時來研究本案文件，而彭背後亦有一整個辯方團隊，質疑沒有理由「見林不見樹」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰一度問，假設法庭不批准重召張劍虹的話，會如何對被告黎智英造成不公；又問若然不傳召張劍虹，轉而傳召黎智英女兒 Claire Lai 作辯方證人，以確認相關 Slack 紀錄，會否同樣協助到辯方。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰追問，辯方能否提出任何合理理由，解釋到為何在張劍虹作供期間不就 Slack 紀錄提問。她並強調，司法公正除了包括辯方的利益之外，也包括控方的利益和公眾利益。彭指當時辯方尚未知道 Slack 群組的會議紀錄存在。杜官卻質疑，當張劍虹庭上首次提及 Slack 之後，辯方大可以向法庭表示需時索取相關紀錄，申請押後數天，待取得相關紀錄後才繼續盤問。彭則稱，事實上當張劍虹確認了 Slack 紀錄存在之後，辯方團隊已經即時採取相應行動，包括向控方查問。杜官質疑，黎本來是 Slack 群組的成員之一，辯方根本毋須等待張劍虹確認之後才開始找尋 Slack 紀錄。法官李運騰補充，Slack 群組是由黎智英開設的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行陳詞指，若果法庭批准重召張劍虹的話，並不符合司法公義，而司法公義包括控方的利益及其所代表的公眾利益。控方亦補充，他們手上並沒有任何 Slack 群組紀錄，所以沒有提供予辯方，但是強調控方已經盡了他們的責任去舉證。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭耀鴻最後回應指，看不到若果法庭批准重召張劍虹的話，會怎樣損害公眾利益。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官押後至周四（16日）宣布決定。控方另外確認有5名警員證人準備好出庭作供。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;辯方申重新傳召張劍虹 事務律師稱今年1月才首度知悉「飯盒會」會議紀錄存在&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（13日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第75日審訊。辯方申請重召前《蘋果》社長張劍虹出庭作供，冀就通訊群組 Slack 內的「飯盒會」紀錄提問。代表黎智英的事務律師何俊豪（Johnny Ho）親自作供，他稱在今年1月29日張劍虹被辯方盤問期間，才首次在庭上聽到「飯盒會」的會議紀錄會被上載至通訊軟件 Slack，辯方翌日去信控方索取 Slack 紀錄不果，之後嘗試自行透過其他途徑，直至2月26日才成功取得 Slack 紀錄。翻查報導，其時張劍虹已作供完畢。控方則質疑，在張劍虹出庭作供之前，辯方團隊理應有足夠時間就「飯盒會」向控方提出詢問，或者自行作出調查。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表黎智英的羅拔臣律師行合夥人兼事務律師何俊豪（Johnny Ho）親自作供，他在2006至2008年做見習律師，之後由2009年起正式執業至今，職責一直都是處理刑事訴訟案件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何確認，自黎智英於2020年8月10日被拘捕起，他一直是黎的法律代表，對於控方的指控內容熟悉，亦收妥由控方提交的書面證人供詞，包括前《蘋果》社長張劍虹、前《蘋果》副社長陳沛敏和前主筆楊清奇。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何亦確認，他大約於2021年12月收妥上述3名「從犯證人」的書面口供，當中有提及過「飯盒會」，至2022年6月21日再收到3人案件轉介至高院的文件。控方其後於2022年11月17日將控方開案陳詞提交予辯方。換言之，辯方從一系列文件中可以知悉「飯盒會」是控方的重要指證。何亦確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/HHrG3th.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 左起：張劍虹、黎智英、周達權（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方盤問時質疑，辯方團隊有足夠的時間去查問控方或自行作出調查。何則表示「呢方面可能有少少唔同意」，他指控方證人供詞和控方文件中並未提及過「飯盒會」的會議重點會被上載至通訊軟件 Slack，直至今年1月29日，辯方庭上盤問張劍虹期間，張才首度提及 Slack。何指，辯方團隊遂於1月30日去信控方，要求提供 Slack 群組的通訊紀錄；控方於2月1日以書信回覆，稱沒有相關紀錄。何表示，從那時起辯方團隊才開始想辦法，嘗試以其他途徑取得過往的 Slack 紀錄，直至2月26日才成功透過黎智英女兒 Claire Lai 取得。翻查報導，其時張劍虹已作供完畢，接著陳沛敏上庭作供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑，辯方在張劍虹作供之前，分別3次收到控方文件和證人口供，理應有充足的機會及時間向控方查問關於「飯盒會」的材料。惟何表示「有少少唔同意」，因為 Slack 從沒在證人供詞和控方文件中出現過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在辯方資深大律師彭耀鴻的覆問下，何確認，控方所提供的證人供詞從沒有提及「飯盒會」有任何會議紀錄，而他第一次聽到證人使用 Slack 來上載「飯盒會」紀錄的時候，是在今年1月29日張劍虹作供期間。何又提到，本案的已被使用材料（used material）和未被使用材料（unused material）的總和，是他15年律師生涯以來見過最多的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方表示會於今天下午提交陳詞，辯方則於明早提交回應陳詞。法官押後至明日下午續審。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;控方專家指決定制裁對象涉主觀判斷 難免錯誤詮釋和濫用、構成脅迫&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（10日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第74日審訊。控方庭上讀出城大法律學院教授、梁美芬丈夫王貴國的專家報告，他指在美國的《香港人權及民主法案》之下，當某名人士符合「須為法外引渡、隨意拘留或施以酷刑行為負責」，或者「其他嚴重地侵犯香港人權的情況」，便會被制裁；可是王認為上述條件牽涉非常主觀的判斷，加上須與美國法律一併詮釋，難免被錯誤詮釋和濫用，在實際執行上構成脅迫。王又指，《香港人權及民主法案》可能影響美國公民和機構，以及非美國公民，包括被拒批出入境簽證、資產被封鎖及影響與美國企業做生意等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;王貴國毋須出庭作供-庭上讀出其專家報告&quot;&gt;王貴國毋須出庭作供 庭上讀出其專家報告&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控辯雙方早前經商討後達成協議，專家證人、梁美芬丈夫王貴國的證供可以書面形式處理，而毋須傳召他出庭作供。控方代表、高級檢控官陳頴琛遂讀出王貴國的專家報告，他現時為香港城市大學法律學院、中國法與比較法講座教授，曾取得美國哥倫比亞大學法學碩士和耶魯大學法哲學博士。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;王貴國於2022年11月17日就本案提交一份專家報告，其後於2023年11月15日提交另一份補充報告，以講述外國制裁、封鎖和禁運措施的法律後果和時效。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;報告列出美國就香港而實施的制裁和政策等：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;2019年6月，美國議員盧比奧動議《香港人權及民主法案》（Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act），同年11月，參議院和眾議院先後投票通過，至11月27日獲時任美國總統特朗普簽署，使它正式成為美國法律。法案授權美國總統對有關中國官員實施制裁，包括禁止入境美國、資產封鎖；並要求美國國務卿每年提交有關香港的報告。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;2020年6月30日，有美國議員提出《香港安全港法案》（Hong Kong Safe Harbor Act），要求美國政府向示威者批出難民資格。惟至今法案尚未正式成為美國法律。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;2020年7月14日，特朗普正式簽署《香港自治法》（Hong Kong Autonomy Act），成為法律。法案授權美國政府制裁有份損害香港自治權的中國及香港官員、以及與制裁對象有業務往來的金融機構與企業。法案亦支持被「迫害」的香港永久性居民入境美國。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;同日，特朗普簽署《香港正常化總統行政命令》（President’s Executive Order 13936 on Hong Kong Normalization），指稱香港的情況對美國國家安全、對外政策及經濟構成威脅，宣布暫緩或取消對香港的特別待遇，以及授權制裁與香港有關人士及機構（entities）。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;2020年8月7日，美國政府宣布對11名中央及香港特區政府官員實施制裁，包括時任特首林鄭月娥，指他們落實國安法及損害香港高度自治。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;2020年8月11日，美國國土安全部宣布由同年9月25日起，從香港進口美國的產品須註明原產地是「中國」，而不能標籤「香港」。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;2020年8月19日，美國國務院宣布終止與香港簽署的三項雙邊協議，包括逃犯的移交、被判刑人士的移交、豁免國際船運利得稅。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;2020年10月14日，美國國務院根據《香港自治法》向國會提交第一份報告，列出10名被指有份「削弱香港自治」的中央及特區政府官員，以及威脅制裁與該10人有關的金融機構。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;2020年11月9日，美國國務院宣布制裁4名中央及香港特區官員，包括國安公署副署長李江舟、時任國安處副處長劉賜蕙、時任高級警司李桂華（現為總警司）和時任港澳辦副主任鄧中華，指他們威脅香港的和平、安全和自治。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;2020年12月7日，美國國務院以人大常委會製訂《國安法》及DQ 4名反對派立法會議員為由，制裁14名人大常委會副委員長。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;2021年1月15日，時任美國國務卿蓬佩奧發表聲明，以香港警察拘捕55名民主派為由，宣布制裁6名中央政府及香港特區政府官員。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;2021年3月16日，美國國務更新《香港自治法》報告，稱有見人大通過「完善」香港選舉制度的決定及實施《國安法》，宣布更新制裁名單和追加金融制裁措施。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;2021年7月7日，美國白宮發布《與香港有關國家緊急狀態繼續實施的通知》（Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency with Respect to Hong Kong），宣布延長針對香港狀況而頒布的國家緊急狀態，以及延長美國對香港制裁措施一年。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;2021年7月16日，美國國務院、商務部、國土安全部和財政部，以實施《國安法》及《蘋果日報》關閉為由，聯合發表「香港商業警告」（Hong Kong Business Advisory），並宣布制裁7名中聯辦官員。同日美國國務卿布林肯（Antony Blinken）發表一份《國安法》實施一周年的聲明，指稱《國安法》使香港營商環境轉差。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;王貴國指制裁條件牽涉主觀判斷-難免被錯誤詮釋和濫用&quot;&gt;王貴國指制裁條件牽涉主觀判斷 難免被錯誤詮釋和濫用&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;王貴國在報告中指出，在《香港人權及民主法案》之下，當某名外國人符合一些條件的話，便會被實施制裁，包括「須為法外引渡（extrajudicial rendition）、隨意拘留（arbitrary detention）或施以酷刑（torture）行為負責」，或者「其他嚴重地侵犯（gross violation）香港人權的情況」。可是王貴國認為上述條件中，「負責（responsible）」、「隨意（arbitrary）」和「嚴重（gross）」等字眼牽涉非常主觀的判斷，加上須與美國法律一併詮釋，因此上述條件難免被錯誤詮釋和濫用，在實際執行上構成脅迫（coercion）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;王貴國指，《香港人權及民主法案》可能影響美國公民和機構，以及非美國公民，包括被拒批出入境簽證、資產被封鎖及資產利息被拿掉等，如果他們和美國企業做生意的話，也會受到影響。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;王貴國指，《香港人權及民主法案》亦會對香港和中國內地的金融機構造成直接影響，因在全球化營商環境下，美元仍然是國際交易裡的主導貨幣，而且金融機構需要全球化地運作，法案會影響相關金融機構的運作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;王貴國又指，制裁政策與美國其他法律互有關連，所以制裁的實質影響是累積性的，而不能獨立於其他政策，例如美國的《移民和國籍法》、《香港關係法》和聯合國制裁措施等。就大部份人而言，為了避免觸犯《香港人權及民主法案》，他們自然地會避免處理或接觸任何被法案針對的人士和機構。若然被制裁的人在美國境內的銀行戶口有存款，該人便不會提取該筆款項；若然該人持有美國的物業，而且有第三方租用該物業，業主便未能收取租金，因為收租也會被視為一項商業交易。##&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;周達權堅稱飯盒會曾討論過一人一信救香港&quot;&gt;周達權堅稱「飯盒會」曾討論過「一人一信救香港」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，前壹傳媒營運總裁兼財務總裁周達權第4天出庭作供。辯方盤問時指出，在周達權過往出席的所有「飯盒會」之中，從沒有出現過任何有關特刊《自由之夏》的討論。惟周表示：「我唔係好記得。」辯方又指，周出席過的「飯盒會」中也沒有出現過任何關於「一人一信救香港」的討論。周則堅稱：「呢個記得有傾過嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在控方覆問下，周確認他在2020年8月10日被拘捕，當時他向警方提供了手機解鎖密碼，但提出了法律專業保密權（Legal Professional Privilege），但他其後於2022年1至2月左右透過代表律師去信政府，表明放棄相關權利。法官李運騰問，當時是農曆新年之前還是之後，周則表示：「對唔住法官閣下，嗰段時間我都好迷惘，所以我記唔到呢啲嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周供稱，後來警察聯絡他，表示手機和 iPad 均無法以他所提供的密碼解鎖，周當時回覆警方「係得呢個密碼」，對方依然無法解鎖，之後便沒有再聯絡他。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周達權作供完畢。由於辯方申請重召前《蘋果》社長張劍虹出庭作供，法官押後至下周一（5月13日）處理申請，並擬聽取辯方事務律師何俊豪（Johnny Ho）的證供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（9日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第73日審訊。前壹傳媒營運總裁兼財務總裁周達權第3天出庭作供。控方案情指稱黎智英透過召開「飯盒會」來下達編採指示，不過辯方盤問時指，大部份「飯盒會」的討論內容均與《蘋果》生意業務相關，而且「飯盒會」的目的並非讓黎智英下達編採指示。惟周達權不同意。另外，辯方指2018年，前特首梁振英在其社交媒體專頁上公開點名和批評《蘋果》的廣告商，所以《蘋果》便透過其他方式來增加收入，包括推行網上訂閱計劃、支持小店和隨報附送刊物。周確認，並指若果附送比較特別的刊物，會對當日的報紙銷售有幫助，但效果不長久。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周達權第三天出庭作供，代表黎智英的資深大律師彭耀鴻開始盤問。周早前供稱加拿大公司 Lais Hotel Property Limited 是由黎智英持有，辯方今質疑周的說法是否準確，因公司是黎以信託形式持有。惟周表示這方面不太清楚，但以他所知，「黎生係有畀錢去買嗰啲酒店，同埋佢有去畀指示點樣去營運。」辯方又指，周是該公司的信託保護人。惟周表示不清楚。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指飯盒會目的非讓黎智英下達編採指示-周達權不同意&quot;&gt;辯方指「飯盒會」目的非讓黎智英下達編採指示 周達權不同意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就《蘋果》高層定期召開的「飯盒會」，周達權指以他理解，開會之前同事會先透過通訊軟件詢問出席人士有什麼問題或議題想討論，然後黎智英有可能會作出回應，或者表示屆時開會再討論。周稱他們曾經有一段時間使用通訊軟件 Slack，之後有使用 WhatsApp。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方向周達權展示 Slack 群組介面截圖。周相信他有出席2019年12月16日的「飯盒會」，當辯方指黎說過未能出席該次會議，周則表示不記得。辯方指，黎智英有時候未能出席「飯盒會」，在這些情況下，時任《蘋果》社長張劍虹便會負責主持會議。周確認：「係會嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指某些「飯盒會」上談及廣告和銷售方面遇到的困難，並提出改善建議，而2019年12月6日的「飯盒會」則首次談及替小店登廣告，惟該次會議黎智英並沒有出席。辯方指，大部份「飯盒會」的討論內容均與《蘋果》的生意業務相關，而且「飯盒會」的目的並非讓黎智英下達編採指示。惟周達權不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黎智英2014年12月辭去主席後錄得虧損-2018年重回集團後虧損放緩&quot;&gt;辯方：黎智英2014年12月辭去主席後錄得虧損 2018年重回集團後虧損放緩&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，在2001至2012年之間，壹傳媒有限公司錄得合共超過20億的盈利，惟在2003至2004財政年度裏，因為沙士爆發而錄得接近9千萬虧損。周達權補充，當年除了沙士以外，《蘋果》亦有在台灣開設電視台，因而支出增加。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方總結指，在大約10年之間，壹傳媒經歷台灣的業務投資、2003年的沙士疫情和2008至2009年的全球金融危機，壹傳媒仍然錄得盈利，可謂在黎智英的領導下非常成功。周達權同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，可是在全球而言，紙媒漸漸衰落，為壹傳媒的生意帶來隱憂，因此在2001年起，壹傳媒一直花費不少功夫令收入來源多元化，正如黎智英以主席身份在年報撰文，稱集團正面對挑戰，會研究開拓不同收入來源和迎接新科技，包括在台灣開設電視台及加強數碼平台。辯方指，不幸地台灣電視台不太成功，最終集團以一個大的虧損金額來賣出電視台。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指2014年12月12日，黎智英辭去壹傳媒集團主席一職，往後3年，壹傳媒每年均錄得以億計的虧蝕，直至2018年，黎智英重返壹傳媒集團。辯方續指，往後2018至2021年，集團每年錄得的虧蝕金額有所減少，而且期間碰上反修例運動和新冠疫情爆發。周同意，並補充壹傳媒當時亦有發展網上訂閱系統。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指前特首梁振英點名批評廣告商-故蘋果以不同方法增收入&quot;&gt;辯方指前特首梁振英點名批評廣告商 故《蘋果》以不同方法增收入&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，一般而言營運傳媒的主要收入來源是廣告費，事實上2002至2017年期間《蘋果》的廣告收入，是報紙銷售額的1.6至2倍。辯方續指，在2018年，前特首梁振英在其社交媒體專頁上公開點名和批評在《蘋果》落廣告的企業。周達權則表示，他有聽說過此事，但他未有親自進入梁的專頁看過相關內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，在那時開始，《蘋果》便開始推行網上的免費訂閱計劃，之後轉為收費訂閱，又透過其他方式來增加收入，例如支持小店。此外，辯方指在2019至2020年期間，《蘋果》希望盡可能賣出最多數量的報紙，所以其中一個做法是隨報附送一些刊物。周確認，又指如果附送一些比較特別的刊物的話，會對當日的銷售有幫助，「我觀察到係會有幫助，但唔係長久嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周達權作供未完，案件明日續審。另外，辯方擬向法庭申請重召前《蘋果》社長張劍虹出庭作供，就員工通訊的 Slack 群組提問，法官表示明日將聽取辯方陳詞及處理申請。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;executive-summary&quot;&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This workshop report presents a summary of observations and discussions related to an event on the use of AI in intelligence by 2040, held in February 2024. The future scenario workshop was held to examine the use and implications of AI in a hypothetical 2040. It was based on a hypothetical scenario in which the relationship between a technically advanced economic and military power called Roland and the neighbouring island state Islay deteriorates. It unfolded in three parts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The build-up of military exercises by Roland near Islay and the potential for invasion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roland’s full-scale invasion of Islay.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roland establishing civilian authority over Islay.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop was structured around the scenario phases. The following are key observations that participants made in the context of each scenario phase but have relevance to the broader question of what AI use in an intelligence context will look like by 2040 and what implications and questions follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;part-1-pre-invasion&quot;&gt;Part 1: Pre-Invasion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The adversary’s widespread AI integration in military structures likely constitutes a strategic advantage, increasing accuracy and efficiency, especially for data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, AI dependency and integration also constitutes an additional risk where access can be achieved to the adversary’s systems and data, for example for information on the adversary’s movements of troops and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The quality, not just the quantity, of data is decisive for intelligence purposes. Authenticating information is therefore a key capability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Communication and assessment of information is likely challenging in this scenario, including the communication of accurate information and analysing available information at fast pace.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is unclear how the UK achieves deterrencein this context or what deterrence looks like in a zero-trust, AI-fuelled environment. This relates to both the communication of information and the sharing of capabilities for deterrence purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;part-2-full-scale-invasion&quot;&gt;Part 2: Full-Scale Invasion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI can be used to design efficient evacuations, for example to identify British individuals and their next of kin , or to design and optimise exit plans.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;UK support to allies includes sharing intelligence capabilities and assisting integration and coordination of datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be prepared for a full-scale invasion scenario, the UK government needs to invest in and support the development of key enable rs, such as computing power, communication infrastructure and critical technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The UK government also needs more credible technology leadership to implement such aims.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Procurement needs to become more agile to enable shorter innovation cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;part-3-civilian-authority-established&quot;&gt;Part 3: Civilian Authority Established&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Information operations may be less effective in a context of information chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a significant need for authentication methods.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is important that both AI systems and humans are trained in cultural comprehension. At the same time, AI can help to understand culture, history and their lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants further assessed wider implications, such as the need for the UK to expand AI training for all sectors and skills levels, and identified further research questions based on these observations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This workshop report presents a summary of observations and discussions related to an event on the use of AI in intelligence by 2040, held in February 2024. The future scenario workshop was held to examine the use and implications of AI in a hypothetical 2040. The report highlights two major aims of the workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, by using a future scenario, it aimed to contribute to the discussion by setting out how the use of AI might enable a profoundly different approach to intelligence by the year 2040. Second, it aimed to improve UK preparedness for this scenario by informing questions for future research, as well as potential challenges, implications and milestones that need to be reached, both for such a scenario to come about, and to enable mitigation of any risks that could arise as a result of such developments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hypothetical scenario concerns the deteriorating relationship between a technically advanced economic and military power called Roland and the neighbouring island state Islay. The scenario progresses in three parts: the build-up of military exercises by Roland near Islay and the potential for invasion (Part 1); Roland’s full-scale invasion of Islay (Part 2); and Roland establishing civilian authority over Islay (Part 3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;workshop-methodology&quot;&gt;Workshop Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report is based on a two-part workshop with practitioners, representatives from the public and private sectors, and academics. The workshop was co-organised by the Trustworthy Autonomous Systems (TAS) Hub and RUSI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first part of the workshop, participants discussed a hypothetical future scenario illustrating the use of AI in a 2040 intelligence context. They received several prompts for a future scenario (listed below as Parts 1–3). These mirrored the six phases of conflict to structure the discussion. The scenario evolved in three parts, each representing two phases of the conflict cycle (colour-coded below on Figure A). For the second part of the workshop, participants were split into breakout groups reflecting the stages of the scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/3p51NcI.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Six Phases of Conflict, Grouped in Line with Workshop Discussions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;limitations&quot;&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workshop discussions were held at an unclassified level. Access to information, particularly in an intelligence context, and participants’ ability to share their knowledge, was therefore, at times, limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scenario is hypothetical, and participants did not receive background information on Roland’s or Islay’s capabilities or additional context. Given the lack of details about the cultural, historical or political context of Roland, discussion remained speculative at times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;structure&quot;&gt;Structure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report’s structure follows the three phases of the fictional scenario. Each section of the report introduces the specific setting of each part of the scenario. It then offers reflections from the plenary and the respective breakout groups that were charged with examining each part of the scenario in further depth. Finally, a fourth section addresses wider implications that follow from the overall scenario, including legal, ethical and workforce implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-scenario&quot;&gt;The Scenario&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The information boxes in each of the following subsections describe the initial scenario input participants received. The boxes are divided into three progressive phases of the escalation and are followed by the participants’ reaction to each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scenario-part-1&quot;&gt;Scenario Part 1&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Description&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Over the next decade and a half, a large and economically powerful adversary – a state called Roland – expands its technological advantage in AI and uses its technological and economic power to advance its geostrategic ambitions. Through a combination of industrial cyber espionage operations, innovation, widespread exports of its technologies and internal implementation strategies, the country manages to roll out the wide use of AI, including in its defence, intelligence and police sector. Roland has access to some of the most advanced AI systems. Roland has different cultural and ethical norms from the UK and is willing to use AI technologies in ways the UK would not.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It is now 2040. Over the past few months, Roland has repeatedly held large-scale military exercises. It is now feared that Roland will invade a neighbouring country, Islay, an island state. Out of fear of such invasion, Islay has forged close bonds with regional allies and NATO countries seeking to deter conflict.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/V0yD6xV.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: Lead-up to Invasion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI integration as a (dis)advantage?&lt;/strong&gt; Participants considered whether Roland’s widespread integration of AI is a strength or a weakness. Initial assumptions implied that widespread AI integration would lead to greater efficiency and high technological advancement. However, there was disagreement and uncertainty about what AI-enabled weapons and systems would be available by 2040, and whether they might introduce new vulnerabilities. Participants reflected that, while in the medium to long term, military adoption of AI is likely to confer strategic advantage, early adopters may inadvertently introduce new, difficult-to-predict weaknesses. Such weaknesses can be exploited by technologically adept adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wider AI integration could therefore also constitute a weakness if access to Roland’s datasets can be achieved. For example, if Roland is widely using AI systems in its military operations, it would also do so for its troop mobilisation and exercises. If access to such data can be secured, Islay and its allies could accurately monitor equipment and troop movements. A comparison was drawn with the fitness data collected by the app Strava, popular among military personnel tracking their exercise. In 2018, data shared by athletes as part of a public social network revealed base locations and patrol routes. Similar information can draw a telling picture for Islay and allied intelligence services if access to the adversary’s data can be secured. In that sense, the widespread integration of AI could constitute a weakness for Roland as it possibly leads to new vulnerabilities. High standards of operational security are therefore likely to be an even more critical factor in future military conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communication and decision-making in a disinformation environment.&lt;/strong&gt; Observations also addressed implications of sharing genuine information and disinformation. In view of expected domestic but also international disinformation campaigns, enabled by deepfakes and tailored to individuals, experts considered that there is a real risk that any information acquired might be manufactured. One expert described this scenario as an “arms race for who can manufacture and identify fake information more effectively”. In such a context, communicating accurate information also poses a challenge. Technologies such as cryptographic watermarking to verify the provenance of authentic media such as governmental communications will be increasingly important. Experts were concerned about building communication bridges but also the speed at which decision-makers must rely on, assess and judge available information. It is expected that time pressure for data assessment and decision-making is likely to increase by 2040. This enhances the risk that decision-makers do not have sufficient time or inclination to assess the quality of data underlying their decision-making process. AI assistance could be helpful in this context, to address the scale and pace of this challenge, although it might limit the involvement of meaningful human oversight and understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality of data.&lt;/strong&gt; Participants anticipated that more data will be available by 2040, but expressed concern about the quality of data fuelling AI technologies and intelligence work more generally. How do you ensure the data collected or used to train your own AI systems is accurate and useful? Experts argued that the decentralised nature of the UK intelligence community can constitute an advantage, as different institutions would likely use different datasets, thus making them more resilient to false information and enable checks and balances. However, data analysts pointed out that any available data is only useful if it can be turned into information that is useful – a process that currently still requires human input, and that human input is unlikely to scale to meet the data needs in 2040. Testing the information pace prior to such a scenario is thus a key element of preparation. The participants also pointed out that by 2040 it is likely that a large proportion of data available for machine learning models may, in fact, be AI generated. The implications of this remain to be clarified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to communicate for deterrence.&lt;/strong&gt; In this zero-trust context, disinformation and the validation or reliance on false information determine a pre-conflict scenario of the kind given here between Roland and Islay. This includes potential communication between conflict parties and their allies. A fundamental concern is how to deter the adversary without being misinterpreted. Even communication to de-escalate a situation may not be trusted. It is even unclear what deterrence looks like in such scenario, raising questions such as what kind of deterrence signals Islay, the UK and allies would want to send, and what channels to use to send them. Traditional deterrence relies on hardware such as nuclear missiles to signal capabilities and willingness to use them. For some experts, AI technology’s deterrence is much more communication-based, with doubt and need to interpret the adversary’s capabilities remaining. The adversary would have to rely on its own intelligence to assess allied AI capabilities. Other participants considered that deterrence in this context remains of a physical nature , in that AI would be implemented in weapons and other sys tems. One expert added that AI enabled more opportunity for deterrence without putting humans at risk , for example where subsurface weapon systems could patrol the waters around Islay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capability sharing as deterrence.&lt;/strong&gt; Similarly, it was unclear what kind of AI-enabled military capabilities the UK and other allies can provide to Islay to ensure deterrence. Some were sceptical about providing AI technologies to Islay which might be an ally in that context but not in the future. They drew attention to the risk that the UK and its allies might regret providing technologies that could be used against them in the future. This concern reflects experiences of the Cold War, when Western allies provided capabilities to states for deterrence against the Soviets, but which were later used against them. This was the case with training and weapons supplied to the Mujahedeen in Afghanistan, who were equipped by Western powers to withstand the Soviet Union but later turned against former supporters. Providing capabilities to Islay may, however, also become easier with the expansion of AI technologies. One practitioner pointed out that in Ukraine, the delivery of capabilities is restricted due to concerns that weapons may be used for escalation. AI systems, however, could be programmed to only be used for predefined purposes, eliminating the risk of escalation and enabling earlier capability sharing. A technologist supported this assessment, explaining that if Islay were able to circumvent the programmed restrictions by reverse engineering the delivered AI systems, it would have the necessary skills to make them in the first place. However, one participant pointed out that it might not be within allies’ power to decide what AI technologies to share if they are increasingly open source or off-the-shelf technologies. In this scenario, the bar to diffusion may be quite low. The assumption that the UK and its allies can determine who has access to what technologies and capabilities might be a false premise , according to this expert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relationship between AI, deterrence and implications for (de-)escalation were identified as areas of great interest for future research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI to enhance cultural understanding.&lt;/strong&gt; Socio-technical approaches that combine AI with behavioural and social science understanding to improve cultural understanding featured in many additional observations participants made on the scenario. AI was perceived as helpful in some instances but less so in others. For example, some considered that AI technologies could help understand adversaries and their culture, history and ethical norms, including their online security culture. AI’s perceived role in fostering understanding of other cultures was considered particularly helpful given that it has been challenging for the UK and its allies to understand how the adversary thinks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Back to human intelligence?&lt;/strong&gt; Others, however, found that in this convoluted space of misinformation and big data, the importance of human intelligence stood out to provide situational awareness. One human task includes developing indicators and warnings that ensure the UK and its allies are not being deceived. While AI systems can help identify when these thresholds are met, turning these variables into programmable logic in the first place is a human task. This is especially challenging to develop when determining the adversary’s i ntent to launch an invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop, participants in the breakout group focusing on this scenario discussed three questions that they considered required further attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/wpc7zrJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;description-1&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Description&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A sophisticated propaganda campaign enabled by AI technologies pushes the message of a historical claim to Islay. A purported mass exercise concurrently masks a full-scale invasion of Islay.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/wZTNfnL.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 4: Roland Invades&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI to design efficient evacuations.&lt;/strong&gt; In case of a full-scale invasion, the UK and other countries would seek to evacuate their citizens located in Roland. Experts argued that collected datasets and AI technologies to analyse them can help to identify not only UK citizens and their next of kin but also their locations. Furthermore, AI technologies can be used to identify and optimise exit plans. One participant suggested creating a foreign office evacuation app that leverages AI. An app such as this could disseminate targeted instructions to respective citizens, identifying their best route to evacuation and sending instructions about when to go and where. For example, it could identify an airfield, as well as provide packing instructions. A challenge here is that the app would depend on reliable communication systems – which may be switched off or disrupted in a conflict scenario. However, it was countered that current practices imply that communication systems are too valuable to both parties to a conflict. As a result, it may be unlikely that one party would attempt to switch them off completely. Another challenge was raised by a military practitioner , who pointed out that UK citizens are not normally targetable abroad. In these circumstances, however, exactly that is required. The underlying AI systems would need to be sufficiently flexible and fed by appropriate data. This raises both questions about how and when this data is collected in the first place, and whether it is done so in a way that complies with GDPR and other pri vacy laws. A practitioner in the private sector saw this as less of a problem , based on recent experience of identifying UK citizens for evacuation in Sudan , where some of these capabilities were already implemented. The commercially available information they relied on was indeed GDPR compliant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UK intelligence support for Islay to maintain situational awareness.&lt;/strong&gt; Experts were generally positive about the ability to upskill the intelligence capability of UK allies based on recent experience. While it comes at the risk of losing some of the UK’s control, upskilling Islay by handing over considerable capability of the UK and its allies would improve both Islay’s and the UK’s intelligence-gathering abilities. Data integration is currently still a challenge and takes weeks. By 2040, it will be vastly quicker. One data expert estimated timelines to integrate datasets could move from weeks to hours or days. One expert pointed out that in this scenario, a UK military response is unlikely , as Islay is not part of NATO or another military alliance. Instead, UK support likely plays out in other ways, such as coordination of classified and non-classified data resulting in shar eable intelligence. Allies benefit from the UK’s decentralised intelligence institutions, with data collected by one agency verified by another. Assured quality of data allows the UK and its allies to maintain situational awareness and inform s other steps, for example the designing of particularly effective sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk of centralised technology capabilities.&lt;/strong&gt; The concentration of power in the technology field was considered a risk in this scenario. While militaries retain some autonomy, much of technology capability is developed and implemented by the private sector. The concentration of power is particularly stark for AI technologies, where a few large technology companies hold considerably more knowledge and capability than the public sector. While currently, much of this power is in a few allied hands, this could change by 2040, particularly with the growing capability of open-source AI models. Much depends on the relationship between public and private sectors. Experts warned that it was prudent to assume that whe n a company resides in a specific country, its alliance also sits with said country in a scenario such as this. While commercial concentration is a risk that is difficult to address, possible geostrategic implications are considerable for this future scenario. While some steps have already been taken to diversify and de-risk supply chains, for example for semiconductors, experts were sceptical that these would be significantly decentralised by 2040.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A breakout group discussed these issues further, focusing on three requirements considered necessary to put the UK in a strong position by 2040.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;description-2&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Description&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;After months of occupation, protests in Islay City, one of Islay’s largest smart cities, are gathering momentum in support of resistance. Roland’s regime seeks to suppress these protests.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/7jwdeLf.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 6: Occupation of Islay&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information chaos limiting impact of information operations.&lt;/strong&gt; Experts were sceptical about the impact of information operat ions in this scenario, as large parts of the population may have become desensitis ed to fake news and other misinformation. It is therefore questionable whether propaganda campaigns by Roland would be impactful. On the flip side, even if Islay’s resistance were to produce evidence of atrocities or other unlawful behaviour from occupying forces, there would be questions about whether the wider population would accept them as such, possibly hindering further resistance. One expert argued that if disinformation campaigns continued to proliferate, there would be a risk that, by 2040, people might have become jaded by the overload of genuine information and disinformation. Instead, they might end up believing what they want, closing themselves to genuine information and rational evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need for authent ication methods.&lt;/strong&gt; In this scenario, authentication methods become particularly important for reaching Islay’s as well as Roland’s population. One way to authenticate information is by watermarking it, for example to make fake news or AI-generated information easily identifiable. However, it was unclear who watermarks information and how effective watermarking is. Social media platforms were considered to play a special role in this context – both as potential authorities to regulate or watermark information but also as platforms for intelligence competition, especially prior to an invasion. Another suggestion was that end-users’ technology, such as smartphones, might provide a scoring of the information the user consumes to indicate its accuracy or potential fakeness – a valuable tool that governments might be interested in funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wider technology and communication infrastructure.&lt;/strong&gt; How the UK can support opposition to the occupation and reach Islay’s population also depends on how general communication structures and related technologies will evolve to 2040. One expert referred to the possibility of bypassing government or commercially controlled networks, and the availability of quantum computing to bypass encryption or AI’s capability to break encryption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop, the breakout group discussion focused on the following three aspects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Y37hvUy.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 7: Key Requirements Identified by Breakout Group in Response to Part 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;wider-implications&quot;&gt;Wider Implications&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fourth breakout group remarked the wider implications following from the scenario, particularly focusing on legal, ethical and workforce implications. Its three main takeaways are as follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The UK needs to increase AI training for all sectors and skills levels.&lt;/strong&gt; Participants argued in favour of widespread AI training to develop the UK’s AI literacy. This ensures that people are ready to use AI technologies in their everyday work. More specifically, it is necessary to train people in AI-related critical thinking skills and human–AI teaming methods. In a defence context, that might mean training intelligence analysts so they can prompt AI bots/tools in the right way and optimise results from AI in human–AI interactive engagements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The UK needs to develop its AI assurance capacity.&lt;/strong&gt; Participants suggested creating centres of excellence for AI model auditability and the quantification of AI model uncertainty and predictability. However, they argued that these should be managed by the government, regulators or academia. The involvement of AI vendors was viewed critically, due to a perceived conflict of interest. Importantly, assurance should take place prior to the deployment of AI technologies. This is not the case in current AI models: large language models, such as ChatGPT, are released fast and problems fixed later – an approach deemed undesirable by participants.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The UK needs to actively build resilience into UK data and compute capacity for AI.&lt;/strong&gt; Participants agreed on the vital role of data needed to train AI systems. Dependency risks arise where much of this data is sourced from outside the UK. Data access might be contested in the future – for example in a scenario such as the one examined here. Participants therefore agreed that maintaining a UK data archive for AI training could become even more important. Furthermore, GPU clusters are needed to train AI models. Again, clusters outside the UK might be contested, so more local capacity – such as the UK national AI compute cluster in Bristol – is needed. Participants also agreed that there needs to be more UK sandboxing capacity to evaluate AI models, including to test models that are ethically challenging to UK’s stance. Experts pointed out that competitors are often not as ethically constrained as the UK, but considered there is a need to ensure that the UK’s AI models work effectively within and outside the country’s current ethical stance. This would also allow AI models to operate if the UK’s ethical stance changed in the future, particularly if there were an existential threat to the UK. This was considered necessary as it takes years to develop AI models. Therefore, readiness – including sandboxing – needs to happen years before any such changes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report has set out the use case and implications of AI technologies in an intelligence context taking place in 2040. The hypothetical scenario underlying this analysis concerned the deteriorating relationship between the technically advanced economic and military power Roland and its neighbouring island state Islay. The scenario progressed in three parts: the build-up of military exercises by Roland near Islay and the potential for invasion (Part 1); Roland’s full-scale invasion of Islay (Part 2); and Roland establishing civilian authority over Islay (Part 3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the observations made in this analysis are specific to a particular phase of the conflict. For example, the role of deterrence and potential ways in which the UK can communicate or demonstrate deterrence clearly relate to a pre-full-scale invasion scenario. Similarly, some specific use cases, such as the AI-enabled data analysis for evacuation purposes, are context specific and not equally relevant to all scenario stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majority of observations about the UK’s ability to secure a strategic advantage from AI technologies and how to implement and benefit from these technologies by 2040 applied across all stages of the scenario. Participants repeatedly returned to several core themes. From a human perspective, these included the need for more skills development at all levels and training in human–machine interactions, as well as the need for clear technology leadership among senior UK government officials. On the more technical side, there was uncertainty about the exact use cases and advances that could be expected by 2040. Similarly, questions remained as to the legal, ethical and technical restrictions that should be applied to any AI systems in use. However, there was wide agreement on the urgent need for stronger collaboration with the private sector and the wider technology and innovation ecosystem to harness AI’s full capabilities. This also includes need for stronger governmental leadership on technology investment and development of AI and other related technologies, such as compute and future telecommunication infrastructure. Participants also repeatedly stressed the urgent need for a more agile procurement process to enable shorter innovation cycles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nature of the exercise and the limited information on the fictional states involved left room for speculation and uncertainty. However, this also allowed the conversation to identify interesting questions that can guide future research projects. These included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What does deterrence look like in an age of zero trust and disinformation enabled by AI?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How can procurement become more agile to enable shorter innovation cycles and include more start-ups?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What does it mean to be “a global AI superpower”? How does this translate to areas such as compute, data capture, assurance regimes and effective test environments?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How can the UK’s aim of being a global AI superpower be translated into more concrete short- and medium-term goals?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How can the UK fill the skills gap that arises at all levels, including at a leadership level where more technology expertise is needed to be able to set a concrete vision for UK technology leadership?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How can the UK achieve effective human–machine teaming while setting adequate limitations (for ethical, technical and legal aspects) and implementing appropriate regulation?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What data environment is required to effectively use AI-enabled intelligence capabilities by 2040? What does adequate data governance look like that effectively protects individual freedoms while allowing the UK to secure a strategic advantage through AI-enabled analysis? And what data does the adversary use to train its AI systems? Does it rely on data on its own past military practices? What are the implications?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is the historical and cultural context, and how can the UK use AI to understand this context?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the considerable amount of uncertainty and the fast-moving technological developments that underpin any analysis of the geopolitical and national security implications of AI in an intelligence context, further research into these areas is valuable to the public, private and third sectors of the UK and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;周達權確認有份處理黎私人戶口&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/klOkY0T.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;壹傳媒創辦人黎智英與《蘋果日報》3間相關公司，被控「串謀勾結外國勢力」等罪，案件周三（8日）在西九龍裁判法院（暫代高等法院）展開第72日審訊。控方證人、壹傳媒集團營運總裁兼時任財務總裁周達權第二天作供，控方續問及黎智英名下公司的運作，而周亦確認，佢有份處理黎私人戶口帳目。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周周二確認，自己與黎為離岸公司「LACOCK」董事。及至2020年初，陳梓華成為公司新股東及董事，但他不認識陳，而黎的助手 Mark Simon 曾向他解釋「因為呢個陳梓華，幫阿黎生手、做到嘢，所以黎生將呢間公司轉畀佢作為酬勞」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件由高院《國安法》指定法官杜麗冰、李素蘭及李運騰審理。控方由副刑事檢控專員周天行、助理刑事檢控專員張卓勤、高級檢控官陳穎琛代表；黎智英由資深大律師彭耀鴻、大律師關文渭及有香港執業資格的新西蘭御用大律師 Marc Corlett 代表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1008-開庭&quot;&gt;10:08 開庭&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1010-控方續問黎智英名下公司運作&quot;&gt;10:10 控方續問黎智英名下公司運作&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方繼續就黎智英名下加拿大公司「Lais Hotel Properties Limited」提問，周達權指公司於2010年之前成立﹐主要管理加拿大酒店，例如 Prince of Wales Hotel、Queen’s Landing Hotel，以及 Pillar and Post Hotel，業務與壹傳媒無關，他本人、Mark Simon 和 Robert Jackson 為公司董事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，誰是「Lais Hotel」股東？周稱「上高有一間公司 hold 住」，但不記得該公司名稱，「我記憶應該係黎智英先生擁有」。控方問，周在「Lais Hotel」有何工作？周稱，公司每三個月有一個董事會，每半年一次與核數師開會，每年一個股東大會，「咁我實際上、日常運作我係冇參與」。控方問，周需向誰人匯報？周回答是董事局，主席應該是 Mark Simon。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方再問，周供稱每半年一次與核數師開會，那麼他是否需要處理公司的財務事宜？周稱，不需要處理公司日常財務事宜，而是核數師開會後告知他相關情況，他再去處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1030-周確認有份處理黎智英私人戶口&quot;&gt;10:30 周確認有份處理黎智英私人戶口&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2019年4月25日、由力高顧問有限公司助理財務總監 Linda MENDOZA 傳送至周、Mark Simon 的電郵，副本傳送至員工 Evan Lau，「Kindly approve via return email the following Request For Payments from Lai Chee Ying’s SCSB USD account（請透過回覆電郵，批准黎智英 SCSB 美元帳戶付款請求）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周解釋，Evan Lau 是會計，他向 Linda MENDOZA 或 Mark Simon 匯報，電郵中的「SCSB美元帳戶」是指黎個人的上海商業儲蓄銀行美元帳戶。控方指，該付款請求與 Mark Simon 的計劃有關，涉及200萬美金，詢問周是否知道與甚麼有關？周稱，若 Mark Simon 的計劃獲批准，就會發出付款請求，「我相信黎生 approve 咗，呢個係會計部有嘅程序」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周續指，「咁如果 Linda 佢畀 email 我，就應該已經將呢啲程序行晒，所以我亦都會 approve」。法官李運騰詢問，這是黎的個人銀行帳戶，為何需要周的批准？周稱「我嘅批准，係批准個 payment request form」，讓黎私人公司的核數師查核紀錄，又指他接任工作時，「我係跟返我上手一路咁樣做落嚟」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰再問，周不僅處理黎的私人公司，還處理他的私人銀行戶口？周稱「私人公司就會係 accountant（會計師）做」，又指 Mark Simon 的計劃已獲黎批准，他只是批准相關付款憑證（payment voucher）。周稱，Mark Simon 向 Linda 傳送電郵，「應該有埋黎生嘅 approval」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，為何周稱「應該」？周稱「因為呢一個係公司要有嘅程序，我都認為 Linda 會做咗呢一啲工作，先出呢個 email」。他同意電郵沒有佐證文件紀錄，但重申「呢個係應該有嘅 procedure 嚟，相信 Linda 有做到」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰聞言指，周沒看文件、僅相信 Linda，可算是「橡皮圖章（rubber stamping）」？周稱「如果係咁講，可以係咁講，但係最尾因為呢個戶口係黎先生私人戶口，如果張 cheque 或者 remittance，都係要黎生佢簽返嘅」。控方問，誰設立這程序？周稱「我唔知邊個 set up，但呢個程序係恆之已久」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;針對電郵內的 Mark Simon 計劃，周稱不知道內容，「因為如果寫 Mark’s project，我係唔需要問⋯Mark Simon 同我講，黎生同意呢樣嘢」。李運騰問，周不論如何都會相信 Mark Simon 說法？周稱「咁以往都有其他關於Mark 嘅 project，都有畀過錢，黎生見到個 report 都冇任何嘅異議，咁我覺得係佢冇講到大話囉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1050-控方問及黎名下台灣公司&quot;&gt;10:50 控方問及黎名下台灣公司&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方詢問，是否有一間離岸公司名為「Chartwell」？周同意，以他理解是黎名下的一間台灣公司，但並非由他處理，而是由台灣同事或 Mark Simon 處理，「我實際上係冇參與呢間公司」，亦不清楚 Mark Simon 在這間公司的工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，周如何得悉「Chartwell」是黎名下？周稱「因為我時常都去台灣，咁黎生喺台灣都有佢一班同事，處理佢嘅私人事務，咁有時佢啲私人公司嘅同事會嚟傾計，從而得知」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1054-控方問及黎墊支李宇軒登報事宜&quot;&gt;10:54 控方問及黎墊支李宇軒登報事宜&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示 Mark Simon 於2019年6月27日傳送給 Linda 的電郵，「Linda, Please see the attachment, we are making some payments to newspaper for various advertisements as the groups cannot get their money transferred in time. I will be sending one to you shortly for payment today. We need to pay in this person’s name. Pay in name of Mr Li= LI YU HIN」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;（中譯：請參閱附件，我們正在向報館支付廣告費，但未能及時匯款。今天我會盡快向你發送款項，我們需要以李宇軒名義付款）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，此交易關於甚麼？周稱，Mark Simon 通知 Linda，需要向李宇軒支付500萬元，電郵附件為 Mark Simon 與黎的 WhatsApp 對話，當中提到 Mark Simon 從 Martin 得悉，有人需要500萬元過渡性貸款（bridge loan），Mark Simon 可以在7月4日取回款項，黎遂表示「OK」。至於電郵內所指的廣告費，周稱「我理解係一啲文宣廣告」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，為何 Mark Simon 要向 Linda 發送電郵？周稱，因需要 Linda 簽發支票或轉帳，「阿 Mark 都要（向 Linda）畀埋黎生 approval 先可以做到」，因此在電郵附上他與黎的 WhatsApp 紀錄。控方問，周是否牽涉在內？周稱「我諗我冇參與到」，指 Mark Simon 予他電郵密件副本，僅因他每個月要製作關於黎個人支出的報表，亦不知道該500萬元來源。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2019年6月27日由 Mark Simon 傳送至周、壹傳媒行政總裁張劍虹等人的電郵，「Guys, can you inform them that they have credit for one week and so we will run the ad. And they can pay us within one week. Mr Lai has approved Assisting as they are having trouble moving their money.」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;（中譯：你能否告訴他們，登報人有一周寬限期，我們會投放廣告，而他們可在一周內向我們付款。因為他們在轉移資金方面遇到困難，黎先生已批准了協助。）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周解釋，此有關李宇軒向台灣《蘋果日報》登報事宜，「收到呢個 email 睇到有黎生 approve，我哋就畀咗一個星期 credit 畀呢個客人啦」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1116-小休&quot;&gt;11:16 小休&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1159-周mark-simon-在壹傳媒大樓有固定辦公室&quot;&gt;11:59 周：Mark Simon 在壹傳媒大樓有固定辦公室&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方圍繞《蘋果》「飯盒會」提問。周確認，2019年至2020年期間，自他任職營運總裁後，每周都會參與由黎主持的「飯盒會」，周本人、張劍虹、ICT 部門主管 Connie Chan 會出席。控方問，還有誰人出席？「因為飯盒會有唔同主題，所以要睇吓當時傾啲乜」，例如《蘋果》實體版編輯、壹週刊、《蘋果》網上版、廣告部及業務發展。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰問，Mark Simon 在壹傳媒的角色是甚麼？周稱他沒有正式職銜，「就係黎先生嘅私人助理」，周會聽從其指示。法官李素蘭問，Mark Simon 辦公室在壹傳媒大樓？周同意，他有固定辦公室在壹傳媒大樓，重申他會替黎執行壹傳媒、私人公司上的決定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1212-周飯盒會談及反政府運動黑暴&quot;&gt;12:12 周：「飯盒會」談及反政府運動、「黑暴」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方進一步問及「飯盒會」的內容，周先解釋形式，出席者在開會前在 WhatsApp 提出問題，黎通常會回覆「到時再討論」。其後，「食飯大家有啲傾講啦，咁黎生亦都會講吓，佢對當時個睇法啦，例如當時嘅反政府示威」，亦會討論員工提出的問題。周再指，黎針對問題作出決定，由張劍虹撰寫會議紀錄，再傳送予各出席者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，飯盒會涉及甚麼主題？周指，如果跟報紙相關，「好多時啲話題，都會連帶到當時嘅反政府運動、『黑暴』，咁黎生就會有佢指示，有啲咩會做啦，例如需要多啲人注意，或者可以令到外國有關注」，但不清楚之後編輯做法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;針對周稱「令到外國有關注」，控方問如何達到目的？周舉例，推出《蘋果》英文版、、「一人一信計劃」、「自由之夏」特刊，「咁嗰本特刊有中文版同埋英文版，最主要都係啲相呀、畫冊，關於當時反政府示威呀。咁亦都有少量文字，我冇詳細閱讀，咁英文版係中文版嘅翻譯啦」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方再問，是希望獲得甚麼關注？周稱，是關於香港反政府行動，「或者佢哋所謂嘅『警暴』咁囉，咁亦都希望得到外國嘅支持啦，咁或者係再厲害啲，就係制裁啦」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1230-周蘋果英文版為吸引外國支持&quot;&gt;12:30 周：《蘋果》英文版為吸引外國支持&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，《蘋果》網上版如何吸引更多人關注？周稱，在「飯盒會」曾討論，要多報道反政府示威、示威者，「令到多啲人同情佢哋，呢啲最主要都係啲 video 嚟」。周補充，他由2019年9月、10月任職營運總裁起，參加「飯盒會」，至2020年12月初。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於周有否參與《蘋果》英文版，周稱，他參與 ICT 部分，「make sure launch 到個英文版嘅《蘋果日報》囉」。周解釋，行政總裁著他幫忙管理 ICT，「咁喺呢個情形 make sure 可以準時 launch 到英文版《蘋果日報》，睇住個進度、有咩問題，同埋有咩難題可以幫佢解決到」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，《蘋果》英文版目的是甚麼？周稱讓外國、尤是美國政要閱讀《蘋果》，「咁希望可以爭取到佢哋嘅支持」。他續指，因為當時情況，黎覺得外國支持很重要，令到反政府、反修例運動可以成功，重申「我相信係為咗吸引外國嘅讀者、外國嘅支持」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1240-休庭午膳&quot;&gt;12:40 休庭午膳&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1433-控方就自由之夏特刊提問&quot;&gt;14:33 控方就「自由之夏」特刊提問&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方繼續圍繞「自由之夏」特刊提問，指中文版於2019年9月20日刊出，英文版於同年10月9日刊出；周確認。控方問，刊物是否派發出去？周稱「我嘅理解係賣㗎喎」，刊物同時是一個畫冊，「記錄返佢哋認為嘅警暴，吸引返啲讀者，同埋想增加多啲力量啩」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，「自由之夏」有否在海外派發？周稱「我記得我冇直接 involve 喺海外發行，但係我記得 Mark Simon 有要求過我攞二千幾本」，包括中文版及英文版刊物，用作海外派發，「我嘅理解佢嘅外國係美國、英國嗰啲地方」，但 Mark Simon 沒詳細交代派發至哪些組織。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰問，在刊物英文版寫有「扣除成本捐 612 人道基金」，為何中文版沒有標明？周稱不清楚，但指「可以做呢個決定，我相信係黎生或者 CEO」，又指記得刊物中英文版的淨收益都捐予 612 人道基金。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1448-周mark-simon-年終奬金由黎私人給予&quot;&gt;14:48 周：Mark Simon 年終奬金由黎私人給予&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2019年12月10日、周與黎的 WhatsApp 紀錄，周稱「老闆，你好，以下是 Mark Simon 過往四年的年終獎金你參考：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 2015 US$200,000
2 2016 US$250,000
3 2017 US$300,000
4 2018 US$200,000」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎回覆「跟去年 US$200,000 Thanks. Jimmy.」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周庭上解釋，年終獎金並非由壹傳媒予 Mark Simon，而是黎私人予他，但不記得哪個戶口，「我理解獎金就係你辦事做到得嘅獎金」。周再指，「因為我收到佢指示係畀呢個 bonus，冇提過係咪因為喺壹傳媒定係同黎生私人做咗嘢而畀，我嘅理解 bonus 係你嗰一年工作做得好，所以佢畀呢個 bonus」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周續指，他收到黎的訊息後轉發給 Linda，由她處理付款，強調相關支票由黎簽發。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1455-周一人一信予特朗普會引好多注意力&quot;&gt;14:55 周：「一人一信」予特朗普會引「好多注意力」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年5月13日黎向周傳送一條眾籌網站連結，名為「US Supporting Apple Daily」，「Anna contacted me, I gave them the rate after speaking with our ad department. Now they put an ad up that lets everybody our discount. (So I just tell everybody it’s subsidized).（Anna 聯絡了我，我與廣告部討論後，給了他們折扣，現在他們登廣告，讓每個人都可以享受折扣。（所以我只是告訴大家，這是有補助的）。）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎再稱「Does this crowdfunding campaign come from Simon lee and his friends? Great idea! We can go the same channel for our US subscription effort. Thanks.（這次眾籌活動來自 Simon Lee 和他的朋友嗎？好提議！我們可以透過相同渠道進行美國訂閱工作，謝謝。）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周回覆「Copy that. I will look into it and come back to you. We also have 美蘋撐蘋果計劃和贈閱卷 and will start work immediately. thanks.（收到。我會調查一下後再回覆你，我們還有美蘋撐蘋果計劃和贈閱卷，即將開始工作。謝謝）、「Hi Boss, this one is not coming from Simon Lee. Thanks!（老闆，這不是 Simon Lee 發起的，謝謝）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，訊息提到的眾籌是甚麼？周稱「我諗我其實當時都唔知，都要一段時間先覆返（黎）」，後來他回覆黎有關「美蘋撐蘋果計劃」，「我問咗其他同事，我之後回覆唔係由 Simon Lee（發起）」。周續指，這並非公司舉辦的計劃，他沒進入連結閱讀相關內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，誰是 Simon Lee？周稱是李兆富，之前曾替《蘋果》工作，「之後我理解佢都有幫黎生做嘢」，但不清楚其實際工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方再展示周與黎有關「一人一信行動」的訊息，黎稱「紙信有蘋果 logo 而且傳媒一定會印出來和報道，有助我們之後推廣美國人訂閱蘋果」，周則稱「會立刻跟進」。控方問，他所指的跟進是甚麼？周稱「咁我應該係搵咗劍虹、印刷廠去準備印呢封信」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，為何「一人一信」有助推廣美國人訂閱《蘋果》？周稱「如果要一人一信寄去畀特朗普，咁個聲音會好大囉，咁亦都會有好多注意力囉，咁從而希望多啲人去subscribe、去訂閱《蘋果》」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closer engagement between Russia and China has fuelled assumptions of an emerging axis. The Arctic is often cited as evidence of Sino-Russian alignment due to their growing Arctic ties across the security, strategic and commercial spheres. Beijing frames its Arctic relationship with Russia often in terms of “win-win” agreements and strategies. This term, “win-win”, reflects Beijing’s Confucius thinking, and indicates that the two countries’ bilateral mutually beneficial interests in the region remain far short of the increasingly popular assumption of a brewing Arctic alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resources and transportation (that is, the future history of global maritime trade) are the two primary strategic interests driving China’s Arctic gambit. All components of the Arctic resource “prize” are of interest to Beijing and feature across various policy statements and indeed within China’s 2018 Arctic Strategy. As a burgeoning global trade power, the ability to cut logistics costs and, indeed, transportation times, is of central interest to China. Here, the Northern Sea Route (NSR) – largely hugging the Russian Arctic coastline – links Asia to Europe. Through the Arctic Ocean, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans are connected. Travel time between Asia and Europe via the NSR is about 23 days on average, compared with the Suez Canal’s 37-day average. In 2013, the first Chinese merchant ship transited the NSR and was the first container vessel ever to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s Arctic interest dates to 1925, when it acceded to the Spitsbergen (now Svalbard) Treaty. The treaty benefited the signatories economically by facilitating access to mining rights on the Svalbard archipelago, while agreeing to protect Svalbard from any military buildup. This Arctic archipelago’s scientific and research value was further tapped by China in 2004 when Beijing built the Yellow River Arctic research station – cementing Chinese presence in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the Xue Long (Snow Dragon), China’s first icebreaker, has conducted numerous Arctic research expeditions since 1999. Today, it is joined by Xue Long-2, China’s first indigenously built icebreaker. Murmurs of a nuclear-powered icebreaker about to roll off China’s production yard further point to Beijing’s growing polar capability. In securing observer status to the Arctic Council in 2013, China inserted itself into the Arctic governance ecosystem. But this does not place Beijing at the decision-making table – observers do not vote or lead multilateral discussion within the Arctic Council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond transportation, Beijing seeks to diversify its energy imports across the globe. This makes the resource-rich Russian Arctic Zone (both inland and offshore) an attractive component of China’s diversification strategy. While the Sino-Russian Arctic relationship is predicated on economic foundations, for now, Russia has yet to fall into Beijing’s “debt-trap diplomacy”. Moscow maintains stringent domestic legislation on joint ventures and ownership of sovereign energy deposits. This is a delicate balance. Russia relies on sustained future Chinese demand for Arctic liquified natural gas (LNG), but Moscow has also worked to diversify its capital pools. India, Japan, Saudi Arabia and South Korea are all linked to Russian Arctic energy ventures in one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China does not have a majority share in either of the two key LNG projects on the Russian Arctic’s Yamal Peninsula. Beijing’s share in the Yamal LNG venture is 29.9%, while Russia’s Novatek holds a controlling 50.1% and France’s Total holds 20%. In the Arctic-2 LNG project, China holds 20%, Novatek 60%, Total 10%, and the remaining 10% is held by a Japanese consortium. Russia’s upcoming Arctic energy projects, located in proximity to the existing Yamal Peninsula ventures Ob (LNG), Vostok (oil), Arctic-1 (LNG) and Arctic-3 (LNG), can be expected to attract diverse capital pools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, on the NSR or “polar silk road” front, Russia maintains the upper (controlling) hand. The NSR wraps along the Russian coastline for most of its route. This is important to Russia for two reasons. First, much of the NSR falls within Russia’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and therefore Moscow has deemed it necessary to charge transit tariffs. The tariffs have been accompanied by Russia’s introduction of tight rules and domestic laws for foreign firms looking to use the route. Second, Russia insists vessels can only navigate the NSR when accompanied by Russian nuclear icebreakers. Tapping into NSR potential is thus subject to strict Russian directives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The notion that there is a Sino-Russian Arctic alliance is a misinterpretation of the realities that drive China and Russia together in the Arctic&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While mutually beneficial interests – and the overall sense of “win-win” agreements – facilitate close engagement between Beijing and Moscow in the Arctic, it is still problematic to assume an Arctic “axis” is forthcoming. China’s efforts to increase its engagement in the Arctic are occurring far beyond the Russian Arctic Zone. Iceland was the first European state to sign a free-trade agreement with Beijing, and China’s first intergovernmental framework in the Arctic was struck with Iceland in 2012. Various Chinese state energy interests have been floated in geothermal resources in Iceland – but to date the projects have been abandoned. In 2018, the China–Iceland Arctic Science Observatory opened and continues to operate. Iceland strategically presents as a logistics hub that would act as a key shipping port between Europe and Asia along the NSR. It seems clear that Chinese Arctic strategy is to “internationalise” the Arctic in a way that features and promotes China’s strategic benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is also driven by great power ideology and the prestige afforded by having a global polar footprint. Russia is aware of this simmering rationale for Chinese Arctic strategy. Efforts by China to move beyond the agreed terms of its mutually beneficial arrangement with Moscow within the Russian Arctic Zone, and how closely China adheres to the existing legal and sovereign arrangements of the Arctic Ocean, will certainly be a litmus test for the Sino-Russian Arctic “alliance”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Sino-Russian strategic tensions remain, well beyond the overhanging fear of centuries of mistrust and the issue of the Russian Far East. In June 2020, Moscow accused one of its leading Arctic scientists, Valery Mitko, of spying for Beijing. Mitko was charged with treason for handing over classified information on Arctic research and submarine sensor technology to China. But perhaps more telling is the way that both countries have hushed up the incident, with neither formally commenting on the arrest. For now, Beijing and Moscow appear to agree to disagree – so long as Arctic LNG business is booming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The narrative of Moscow and Beijing working together to carve up the Arctic riches and take control of new global transport corridors has started to make its way into the policy and defence planning documents of Arctic-rim states. Washington’s litany of Arctic strategic planning documents – Naval, Air Force and Coast Guard strategies – feature renewed great power competition in the Arctic as a central security threat. However, the notion that there is a Sino-Russian Arctic alliance is a misinterpretation of the realities that drive China and Russia together in the Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The realities of the Sino-Russian relationship (dubbed by both as one of “mutual benefit”) in the Arctic is best grasped when the limits of the partnership are considered. There are, first and foremost, limits in terms of geographical boundaries. The Russian Arctic Zone is the lion’s share of the Arctic region, home to the NSR and a vast percentage of Arctic resources. The Russian Arctic Zone is also the geographical “limit” of Sino-Russian Arctic “cooperation” as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the eight members of the Arctic Council, Russia took the most convincing to grant China its observer status in 2013. Moscow approved membership, and with it, legitimacy, on the basis that Beijing explicitly acknowledged the sovereignty of Arctic-rim states and reaffirmed its commitment to the legal architecture of the Arctic region – the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia watches, with tempered suspicion, Beijing’s Arctic high sea missions and scientific research agenda in what China sees as a global commons. Yet within the Russian Arctic Zone, Russia welcomes Chinese engagement, but on Kremlin terms. Since 2014, with Western sanctions over Russia’s annexation of Crimea and sustained aggression in Ukraine, Moscow has had a cashflow problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite key economic strategic partnerships in the Russian Arctic, China is busy diversifying itself throughout the region. China is actively engaging with other Arctic-rim powers and has commercial ventures, investment plans and entrenched soft-power strategies in Norway, Canada, Iceland and Denmark (through Greenland).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Despite mutually beneficial interests in the Arctic, commercial realpolitik is at the heart of China and Russia’s engagement in the region&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s Arctic strategy is built on both economic security and frontier border security objectives. The Sino-Russian relationship lends itself to these economic security interests and ambitions, but it is less effective at navigating Russia’s Arctic “siege mentality”. This is largely because of the kind of increased interest and activity that China is undertaking in the Arctic – and against which Russia seeks to secure its vast open frontier. Any deterioration in Sino-Russian ties could threaten this delicate balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian efforts to securitise its economic interests in the Arctic fall short of an expansionist agenda. Beyond the posturing, ultimately Moscow’s Arctic priority remains regional stability. Continued regional cooperation with its NATO-member and Western Arctic neighbours remains a central strategic objective. After all, keeping the arena free of conflict is crucial to ensuring the NSR (and Russia’s future economic resource base) remains open and commercially viable. Russia needs to be able to deliver secure, trusted and unimpeded energy supplies from its northern frontier to Asian and European energy clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same cannot be assumed of Chinese Arctic interests, with clear indicators of an emerging expansionist agenda. While much of Beijing’s recent Arctic Ocean missions have been primarily about “raising the flag” and promoting soft-power public relations campaigns for domestic consumption, it is evident that China is set to stay in the Arctic. While much of the Arctic Ocean is delineated by territorial seas and agreed maritime boundaries, the central Arctic Ocean does hold international waters, which facilitates Chinese engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fragmentation of Sino-Russian relations in the Arctic context might yet emerge from the outcomes of the Arctic continental shelf debate. Via the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, Russia, Canada and Denmark have all submitted formal, yet overlapping, claims to this continental shelf. Should a claim be upheld, the awarded state will then claim exclusive rights to the seabed and the resources beneath the area of the North Pole. This would block China’s access to seabed or resources in the international Arctic waters around the North Pole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, continued efforts to put Moscow and Beijing in the same “basket” when it comes to great power competition in the Arctic “great game” is short-sighted and misses critical opportunities to futureproof the Arctic as a zone of international cooperation, collaboration and low tension. Sino-Russian Arctic ties will continue to be predictable to a large extent. Ties will remain mutually beneficial – until they are not. Predicting this point should be the priority for Arctic stakeholders. The problem appears to be, for now, that many stakeholders assume a fractured or fragmented Sino-Russian Arctic relationship does not exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia and China’s Arctic relationship is not an alliance – it is driven by “win-win” thinking. Such framing is extremely subjective and prone to change. Despite mutually beneficial interests in the region, commercial realpolitik is at the heart of their engagement. For now, the partnership in the Arctic navigates existing fault lines elsewhere, such as Beijing’s failure to acknowledge Russia’s annexation of Crimea and Moscow’s nonalignment in the developing India–China conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sino-Russian mutually beneficial cooperation and engagement within the Russian Arctic Zone is not a Sino-Russian alliance in the Arctic. In a somewhat Confucius-informed position, Beijing wants to “seek harmony and keep differences” when it comes to engagement with Russia in the Arctic. Both countries will remain engaged proactively and collaboratively across industrialisation projects, diplomatic relations and various commercial dealings in the Russian Arctic Zone. But when this “win-win” situation sours, Western Arctic states may indeed be faced with another Arctic security threat – a conflict between Russia and China in the Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;

The question is, “where will the money come from?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe finds itself at both a geopolitical and fiscal crossroads. On the one hand, the European Union is no longer in danger of collapse after a decade of crises. The bloc is beginning to play a stronger global role, with European Commission president Ursula Von Der Leyen endeavoring — and largely succeeding — to lead a “geopolitical commission.” But on the other hand, Europe is facing growing threats and acute challenges to both its security and its economic and governance model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the threat posed by energy dependence and climate change have awakened Europeans to the need to invest in both defense and the energy transition. Europe also fears the possibility that the United States will be less engaged in ensuring European security, especially under a potential second Trump administration. Additionally, the need to support Ukraine and facilitate its European future has revived the potential of EU enlargement, which will require considerable resourcing. Lastly, the rise of China and its predatory business practices has prompted the European Union to take economic security seriously and advance efforts to “de-risk.” As Mario Draghi aptly summed up in the Financial Times, the era of relying on the United States for defense, China for exports, and Russia for energy is over. The former president of the European Central Bank and former Italian prime minister posited: “The geopolitical, economic model upon which Europe rested since the end of the second world war, is gone.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the threat posed by energy dependence and climate change have awakened Europeans to the need to invest in both defense and the energy transition.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet Europe is also finding that this new era of geopolitical competition is costly. Despite having created a monetary union with a common currency, the euro, and a powerful central bank, the European Union lacks a fiscal union and a common fiscal policy. The entire EU budget is less than $200 billion per year (about 1 percent of EU GDP), with 33 percent of that money going to agricultural subsidies. It also has tight fiscal rules (the so-called Stability and Growth Pact) that limit debt and deficit levels for EU member states. A recently agreed reform increases spending flexibility, but the new rules also put pressure on member states to reduce deficits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the quandary facing Europe. It must meet the demands of this new geopolitical era, support Ukraine and strengthen its own defense, provide European public goods, and tackle the climate crisis, but it lacks the appropriate political and institutional mechanisms to fund these investments. The question is, “where will the money come from?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This white paper outlines Europe’s fiscal terrain and presents potential paths forward for the European Union. Whether Europe develops its collective fiscal capacities is of tremendous geopolitical importance and of relevance to the United States. NATO’s defense spending goal of 2 percent of GDP is directly tied to Europe’s fiscal landscape and EU fiscal rules. Moreover, Europe’s capacity to accelerate the energy transition, reduce its energy insecurity, increase its competitiveness, and ensure its economic security crucially depends on the creation of a fiscal union to finance European public goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe is thus at a crossroads. It will not fall apart, as feared in the previous decade, but it could easily stagnate economically and geopolitically without major advances in its fiscal integration. For the European Union — and therefore Europe as a whole — to become a relevant geopolitical actor, Brussels will need to develop its own fiscal capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;For the European Union to become a relevant geopolitical actor, Brussels will need to develop its own fiscal capacity.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;europes-fiscal-terrain&quot;&gt;Europe’s Fiscal Terrain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike in the United States, where the federal budget is much larger than that of individual states, countries in the European Union have relatively high levels of public spending relative to GDP (the EU average is around 50 percent, with some countries, such as France, well above that level). But the bloc, in contrast to the U.S. federal government, spends very little. Also, while U.S. states have credible rules for limiting spending and debt (precisely because federal spending is high), in the European Union such rules are not credible, which generates problems of excess debt and deficits in some member states. This prompted the creation of the Stability and Growth Pact in 1997, which stipulates that deficits should be below 3 percent of GDP and debt levels below 60 percent of GDP. However, these rules were suspended during the Covid-19 pandemic and have recently been reformed because there is wide consensus that applying them without substantial changes would force the European Union into austerity precisely when it needs fiscal flexibility to address its huge challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reasons for the differences between the EU and U.S. fiscal structures are historical. In the United States, political union came before monetary and fiscal union. In 1790, Alexander Hamilton, then secretary of the treasury, transferred the outstanding debts of the federated states to the federal government in exchange for a compromise where states promised to run balanced budgets. On the monetary side, it was only in 1913 that the Federal Reserve was created, inaugurating the contemporary structure of American monetary policy. Otherwise, federal spending in the United States grew as the need to finance public goods, such as defense and infrastructure, increased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the European Union, on the other hand, economic integration began in the 1950s, as most countries had already created or were creating their welfare states, which entailed taxes and spending at the national level. In that context, the EU budget, known as the Multiannual Financial Framework, was created. But it was envisioned — and still is — as a small complement to national budgets for common policies (including agriculture and cohesion funds). In fact, EU rules stipulate that the European budget, which is negotiated for periods of seven years, has to be balanced (i.e., contributions from member states and EU taxes, which are negligible, have to finance all EU spending, and debt issuance is not allowed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, efforts to invest in European public goods with strong positive externalities, such as decarbonization, digitalization, transport and energy infrastructure, or defense, are left to member states. This inevitably leads to shortfalls and discrepancies in investment due to the varying financial capacities of each country, conditioned by its debt and differing national priorities. It also makes pan-European, cross-border investments, whether in infrastructure or defense, more difficult. This creates a typical collective-action problem where joint European action that would benefit all is put on hold, leading to major gaps in European capacity. Not only can this tie the hands of the European Union, leaving it unable to take strong action, but it can also threaten the single market, creating significant disparities between European countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, the European Union (and in particular the eurozone) does not have a coherent and common fiscal policy, but a poorly coordinated one that prevents the adequate financing of many of the urgent European public goods that the new global economic and geopolitical reality makes increasingly necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not news. It has long been recognized that the lack of a common fiscal capacity is a significant gap in the European project. However, in the last year, calls for Europe to take the next step in its integration and develop a fiscal union are coming from increasingly prominent voices and in unexpected places. Leading them is Mario Draghi, who recently wrote in the Economist that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Europe must now confront a host of supranational challenges that will require vast investments in a short time frame, including defense as well as the green transition and digitisation. As it stands, however, Europe neither has a federal strategy to finance them, nor can national policies take up the mantle, as European fiscal and state-aid rules limit the ability of countries to act independently.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He further developed his ideas and called for a fiscal union in the 15th Annual Feldstein Lecture in 2023 (“The Next Flight of the Bumblebee: The Path to Common Fiscal Policy in the Eurozone”). But Draghi is not alone. International institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and a variety of thinktanks and academics have long argued that the European Monetary Union requires a fiscal (and also a political) union to be sustainable — an idea that is backed by significant historical evidence. More recently, Paolo Gentiloni, the European commissioner for economy, has suggested that the bloc establish a central treasury to finance common goods through issuing eurobonds in order to address massive spending demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Momentum is moving toward fiscal union. Should the European Union decide to develop its fiscal capacities, it would be emulating the history of U.S. economic integration. As Jacob Kirkegaard and Adam Posen write, “US national economic institutions formed gradually during the 19th and 20th centuries not only within the confines of a changing federal constitution but also often in response to the specific political events and natural disasters of the time” (emphasis added).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-europe-needs-to-spend&quot;&gt;Why Europe Needs to Spend&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current geopolitical environment provides a clear rationale for collective European investment. There are three clear lines of effort for greater EU spending: defense and foreign policy (including military and economic support for Ukraine), the energy transition, and economic competitiveness. These goals have proved exceptionally difficult given the fiscal constraints explained above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On defense, Europe faces an urgent crisis that requires massive expenditures. The European Union needs to not only support Ukraine’s war effort militarily, but it also needs to urgently rebuild its own militaries. As for Ukraine, wars are incredibly expensive and require massive fiscal outlays and expenditure. The European Union collectively has provided significant economic and military aid to Ukraine. But EU member states have now given away most of their stockpiles of ready military equipment, meaning additional military support for Ukraine requires buying from industry, which is more costly. Moreover, European militaries also require major investment to acquire immediate capabilities — to make up for present shortfalls and to ensure Europeans have the basic capabilities to defend themselves. European states need to spend not just to replace equipment given to Ukraine but also to drastically increase their own stockpiles. Yet, Europe also needs to invest in major capabilities over the medium and long term that both reduce and mitigate Europe’s dependence on the United States. These include the capacity to procure major enabling capabilities, such as air-to-air refueling, as well as invest in the next generation of weaponry, from fighter jets to tanks to air defense systems. This both requires an immediate injection of funding as well as a sustained financial pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While defense is a collective European problem, it is presently funded almost exclusively at the national level. This creates significant gaps in European collective military capabilities, leaving the European Union utterly dependent on the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While defense is a collective European problem, it is presently funded almost exclusively at the national level. This creates significant gaps in European collective military capabilities, leaving the European Union utterly dependent on the United States.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On energy, the needs are great not just for climate but for the competitiveness of European firms, especially in a context in which most great powers, including the United States through the Inflation Reduction Act, are heavily subsidizing energy and green investments. Europe needs to dramatically accelerate the green transition not just for climate purposes but to lower its energy costs, which now largely come from expensive hydrocarbon imports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe needs energy interconnections in order to increase the flexibility and resilience of its electricity system, as well as to be able to leverage the comparative advantages of the different member states in the production of different types of energy. For instance, Spain is becoming a major producer of solar energy, but this energy cannot currently be exported in large quantities to the rest of Europe due to inadequate transmission infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, a subsidy race has begun in the world economy for which the European Union is woefully unprepared. China has increased its support for all types of domestic manufacturing and technology industries, while the United States has revived its own industrial policy with generous support for green and digital industries. The situation is potentially pernicious for European industry because many of the U.S. subsidies consist of tax credits (which are much simpler to implement than European ones). Moreover, the American economy is not permeated with as much bureaucracy as the European Union, and, in addition, its trade and industrial policies contain a series of protectionist clauses that are incompatible with World Trade Organization (WTO) rules (“Buy American”), whereby only products almost entirely manufactured within the United States will be able to benefit from federal subsidies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European response cannot come from each of its individual member states because this would lead those with more fiscal space to inject public funds into their companies, thus undermining fair competition within the internal European market. Therefore, Europe’s response would need to come from industrial policies at the European level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all of these investments, the private sector has an important role to play. However, the fragmentation of European financial markets makes it difficult for private investment to adapt adequately to European needs and thus complement public investments. The European Union therefore will also need to promote the deepening of its banking and capital markets union and move toward the creation of a truly European, risk-free sovereign asset. But since financing public goods and risky investments requires that the public sector takes the lead, it is essential to increase the bloc’s public financial capacities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-europe-could-spend&quot;&gt;How Europe Could Spend&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address Europe’s challenges and to take on a larger geopolitical role, the European Union will need a substantial increase to its budget. In 2022, which is the latest official available figure, the bloc’s GDP was almost €16 trillion ($17 trillion) and the EU budget was €168 billion ($182 billion), equivalent to 1.1 percent of its GDP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union could increase its budget in three ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, member states could increase contributions to the EU budget.&lt;/strong&gt; Member countries pay the European Union every year based on their population and GDP, and those funds are then spent on common policies. To grow the EU budget, larger and richer countries would have to pay more. These countries are typically the ones that benefit most from the existence of the single market. In addition, since the European Union cares about economic convergence and social cohesion between its regions, it is logical that richer countries contribute more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the next EU budget negotiations will not take place until 2027. Member states could in the interim create off-budget vehicles to fund certain priorities. For instance, the European Peace Facility is an off-budget EU instrument, meaning it is not funded by the “EU budget” but by member states contributing at a national level to a separate pot of funds allocated toward a policy priority that benefits the whole bloc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second, the European Union could issue more joint debt.&lt;/strong&gt; More debt issuance at the central level raises complex legal and distributional questions. However, it makes little economic sense that the bloc is unable to issue common debt on a regular basis to finance some specific investments. All other great powers do it. Moreover, the experience of the Next Generation EU (NGEU) — the program launched in 2020 to finance the economic recovery from Covid-19, by which the European Union is issuing up to €750 billion ($814 billion) worth of debt and transferring funds to member states as grants and loans — provides a useful blueprint. In fact, if the European Union were to issue large amounts of debt, it could take advantage of economies of scale which would structurally reduce long-term financing costs and therefore increase the sustainability of national public debts. It would also increase the international role of the euro. There are growing calls from countries such as Estonia for the European Union to issue eurobonds to invest in defense and to provide aid to Ukraine. The issuing of debt for the NGEU program is also leading to investments in the green transition and economic competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debt-financing payments will come out of the EU budget, as they are intended for the NGEU. But increased debt-servicing payments will either require increases to the EU budget or difficult trade-offs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third, the European Union could introduce European taxes.&lt;/strong&gt; These are called “own resources” in the EU jargon because they are collected directly by the European Union. These new European taxes could be “green” taxes, tariffs (such as the Common Border Adjustment Mechanism), levies on multinationals’ profits (as agreed by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development), and levies on financial transactions. Another option, capable of raising much more revenue, would be to transfer a percentage of what member states collect in value-added tax (VAT) to the EU budget. In any case, more EU taxes would be politically difficult, as they may or may not imply lower taxes at the national level (using VAT solves this problem). But they might increase the centrality of the European Union in European politics because citizens would see more clearly that their taxes directly finance European public goods. In this sense, the American saying “no taxation without representation” in the European Union works backwards. There is representation (directly at the European Parliament) and indirectly at the European Commission and European Council, but Brussels has virtually no taxation powers. Approving these new “own resources” requires unanimity by member states, which is not easy, but it does not require treaty change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-political-challenge&quot;&gt;The Political Challenge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is momentum for more EU spending, there is also strong resistance inside the European Union to developing the bloc’s fiscal capacities. The major problem is resistance to the redistributive nature of fiscal integration and common debt issuances, particularly in wealthier Northern European countries. Opposition has become deeply entrenched politically, with claims that the NGEU was merely a “one-off.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difficulties of increasing the EU budget were demonstrated in December, when, despite all the pressing challenges, the increases requested by the European Union were cut. The European Commission’s initial proposal to add €99 billion ($107 billion) between 2024 and 2027 (€66 billion of grants and €33 billion of loans) was reduced to €66 billion (€33 billion of loans and €33 billion of grants), of which only €21 billion is new financing (the rest comes from existing EU funds).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the euro crisis during the 2010s, a divide was created between creditor countries in the north and debtor countries in the south that still persists and impedes consensus. Germany, the Netherlands, and other northern countries are particularly reluctant to mutualize risks and to create financial instruments that increase their solidarity commitments with southern countries, which exhibit higher levels of debt and deficits. They argue that until the usefulness of the NGEU funds can be assessed in 2027, it is premature to consider new joint debt issues. They are also unwilling to increase their contributions to the Multiannual Financial Framework due to tight domestic fiscal environments related to low economic growth, as well as for fear that this will increase support for extreme right-wing parties. The discourse in northern countries is still anchored in the need for rules and spending restraint to avoid the rise of extreme right-wing political groups, which continue to accuse the southern countries of being profligate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the fact that the European Union currently has a majority of center-right (and even some far-right) governments, whose liberal economic visions preach fiscal prudence and a reduced role for the state, also makes it difficult to reach ambitious agreements. Additionally, the ascendency of some far-right parties to positions of power in Europe may make reaching agreement on EU financing efforts extremely challenging. There are tremendous political hurdles to moving forward on fiscal integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it has become cliché to say that Europe is forged through crises. A crisis prompts the need for tangible action, which prompts European states to act. This was evident in response to the Covid-19 pandemic when the European Union bought vaccines for the entire bloc and allocated €750 billion ($814 billion) for its economic recovery, funded extensively through issuing joint debt. The security and energy crises caused by the war in Ukraine may therefore spur further action. The European Union will likely create a fiscal union, perhaps not by setting out with that goal but instead by seeking to address tangible and urgent issues, such as the need to arm Ukraine or accelerate the energy transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-road-toward-fiscal-union-a-permanent-fiscal-capacity&quot;&gt;The Road toward Fiscal Union: A Permanent Fiscal Capacity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that increasing the EU budget will be politically difficult in the short run, an alternative option could be to create a permanent fiscal capacity, which would function as an embryo of a European treasury. A permanent fiscal capacity would be an independent extension of the European budget. It would issue triple-A-rating debt backed by revenues from the European Union’s own resources, thus guaranteeing that the debt would be repaid (if there is political agreement, the issued debt could be rolled over indefinitely, as is the case for most countries with sound fiscal policies).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fiscal capacity would enable the European Union to respond to crises and urgent issues. It could also play a countercyclical role during crises for the eurozone as a whole, complement national automatic stabilizers, support investment in highly indebted member states, and finance specific European public goods with positive externalities, such as those outlined above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to create this permanent fiscal capacity would be the institutionalization of the NGEU as a common financing tool. The logic behind the instrument is simple. The European Union borrows and gives grants or “cheap” loans to member states to finance specific investments and reforms previously negotiated with the European Commission and approved by the European Council. The investments have to focus primarily on the green and digital transitions, as well as defense, and the reforms have to address recommendations that the European Commission makes every year to improve member states’ socioeconomic performance (the so-called “Country Specific Recommendations” of the European Semester).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The disbursement of the funds is conditional. It only takes place once member states have passed the reforms or started the investments. Therefore, it provides a positive incentive for reform: there is a carrot, but there is no stick. If a country does not pass the milestones and targets established in their Recovery and Resilience Facility agreed to with Brussels, it does not receive access to the funds, but it is also not fined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the NGEU funds can be improved in terms of efficiency control or agility in their provision, it would be a mistake to give up the possibility of extending the use of an already implemented and relatively successful (although improvable) mechanism such as the NGEU debt. Some countries insist on canceling the instrument and confirming this experience as a one-off, but the truth is that the current geopolitical demands go far beyond the mere economic recovery needs of Covid-19, which were the original justification for the NGEU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper’s proposed permanent fiscal capacity would imply transfers to member states similar to the current NGEU, but they would be demand-based and without preassigned amounts by country. They should focus on the priorities established above: defense, the energy transition, and competitiveness. Access to the permanent fiscal capacity should be subject to a stricter conditionality, better in terms of milestones, reforms, and assessment than that of the current NGEU mechanism. Governance and ownership should be enhanced through a coordinated decisionmaking process between the European Commission and member states, later ratified by both the European Council and the European Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, part of the spending coming from the fiscal capacity could go directly to European companies that develop investment projects instead of going through member states. This is particularly relevant for defense spending, trans-European infrastructure, and projects of strategic interest entailing substantial research and development investment. Direct procurement by the European Commission could speed up the projects, reduce the administrative burden, and help develop a culture of collaboration between companies from different member states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union will struggle to make progress in addressing the collective European challenges it is facing without massive investment. Yet it is trying to achieve vital goals — ensuring Ukraine’s survival, decarbonizing, rebuilding EU militaries, and enhancing competitiveness — without an adequate budget that supports these objectives, finances basic European public goods, and contributes to the macroeconomic stability of the eurozone. The current debate, however, is focused not on the financial tools needed to achieve preset objectives, but on reducing debt imbalances. While it is important for the European Union to ensure the long-term sustainability of national budgets, it is also important to gauge the financial capacity of the European Union as a whole to take on the current challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While it is important for the European Union to ensure the long-term sustainability of national budgets, it is also important to gauge the financial capacity of the European Union as a whole to take on the current challenges.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, if the European Commission were to issue large quantities of debt on a permanent basis, the international role of the euro would be strengthened. The euro is already the second-most internationally traded currency after the dollar, but it still lags in terms of some of the key functions of an international currency, such as serving as a reference for private and official use. Beyond economic factors, the euro has also lacked the political support to become a more entrenched reserve currency. But things have changed. The erosion of the so-called liberal economic order and the increasingly hostile external environment have alerted the bloc’s leaders to the urgent need to bolster their defense and strengthen economic security. The euro is one of the remaining reliable foundations upon which Brussels can strengthen its geo-economic might. The euro, an orphan currency at its inception, can thus find more backing now than could previously have been imagined. Thus, a permanent fiscal capacity or a fiscal union in the European Union would greatly contribute to the project of making the bloc a geopolitical actor.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;前壹傳媒營運總裁周達權：黎智英將其名下離岸公司轉至陳梓華作為「酬勞」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/aS5Vo8M.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（7日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第71日審訊。已認罪的陳梓華早上作供完畢，結束13天的作供。控方下午傳召前壹傳媒營運總裁兼財務總裁周達權出庭作供，他需就黎的控罪提供真實而全面的證供，來換取控方免於起訴。周提及黎智英名下有很多公司，包括力高顧問有限公司和 Lais Hotel Property Limited，其中力高是黎自資營運的私人公司，財務由黎和 Mark Simon 掌控。早前庭上證供顯示黎智英透過力高向陳梓華支付逾8萬元，以歸還陳去台北和英國的開支費用。就黎智英名下的離岸公司 LACOCK，自2020年1月起，陳梓華成為銀行戶口唯一簽署人，周轉述 Mark Simon 稱陳「幫阿黎生手做咗啲嘢」，所以黎「作為酬勞」把公司轉至陳梓華名下。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華稱國安法後黎智英繼續呼籲制裁 惟辯方質疑陳沒細閱文章內容&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已認罪的被告陳梓華第13天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。控辯雙方昨日均完成提問。其後在法官的提問下，陳稱在國安法生效之後，有在網上見到黎智英繼續呼籲制裁，包括推動「避風港法案」（Harbour Act），又邀請很多外國智庫和政經界名人來做訪問，以及在社交媒體上繼續發表意見。惟辯方代表之一、紐西蘭御用大律師 Marc Corlett 質疑，陳梓華只在 Telegram 上看過一篇或多於一篇的文章標題，便說黎有繼續呼籲制裁，可是他並沒有按進去連結來細閱文章內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方今繼續圍繞此話題盤問，陳承認很多黎智英的文章和訪談均沒有看過，但是他並不是只從文章或訪談去得知黎有繼續呼籲制裁。陳又指，在 Telegram 轉載一個連結的時候，該訊息不會只顯示標題，而是會顯示訪談或文章的摘要，所以他不只看過標題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳稱該訊息是在一個 Telegram 群組收到的，但他不記得是誰人傳送出來，印象中該人傳送連結的同時，有說「喺國際線上嘅新消息或新情報」，而連結內容是關於「外國政府可以限制中國的經濟發展」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華確認從朋友口中得知黎智英邀請外國人訪談-不知道黎有否節目中呼籲制裁&quot;&gt;陳梓華確認從朋友口中得知黎智英邀請外國人訪談 不知道黎有否節目中呼籲制裁&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於陳稱黎在《國安法》生效後推動「避風港法案」（Harbour Act），以及邀請外國智庫和政經界名人進行訪談，辯方質疑以上均是陳從朋友口中得知。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳則指「避風港法案」並非從朋友口中得知，而是他在壹傳媒大樓會見黎智英期間，黎講過「佢會喺美國爭取」，惟他當時不知道黎爭取什麼，後來從黎的私人助手 Mark Simon 得悉黎爭取的是「避風港法案」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就黎智英邀請外國智庫和政經界名人進行訪談，陳確認是因為朋友告知他，所以知道，而他並沒有參與任何相關訪談、不知道訪談內容，也不知道黎有否在訪談節目中呼籲制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3間涉案蘋果公司時任董事周達權出庭作供-獲控方豁免起訴&quot;&gt;3間涉案蘋果公司時任董事周達權出庭作供 獲控方豁免起訴&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方下午傳召前壹傳媒營運總監兼財務總裁周達權出庭作供。周在本案中沒有被起訴，他循法庭特別通道進入庭內，之後以非宗教形式宣誓。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周達權確認，他學歷至大學程度，自1993年加入壹傳媒集團，擔任財務主管；在2016年1月1日至2020年8月25日之間，他擔任壹傳媒集團的財務總裁；在2019年10月至2021年7月2日之間，他亦是壹傳媒的營運總裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周達權亦確認，在2019年1月1日至2021年7月2日期間，他是本案被告3間公司的董事，即蘋果日報有限公司、蘋果日報印刷有限公司及蘋果互聯網有限公司，也是壹傳媒有限公司的行政董事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年8月10日，周達權被警方以「欺詐」罪名拘捕，同日再以「串謀勾結外國勢力危害國家安全」罪拘捕，之後在8月11日獲警方批准擔保。至2020年12月2日，周與黎智英和黃偉強共同被控「欺詐」罪，涉及向科技園有限公司提供虛假陳述。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年6月24日，《蘋果日報》停運。至2021年7月2日，周辭去公司秘書和營運總裁，及至同年9月，他辭去壹傳媒內所有職務。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2022年2月16日，周獲控方發出「免予起訴令」，只要針對黎智英和黃偉強的欺詐、「串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示或複製煽動刊物」和「串謀勾結外國勢力危害國家安全」罪，提供真實而全面的證供，便可以豁免被起訴。在欺詐案件中，周經已出庭作供，黎和黃被裁定罪成，而周的案件則押後。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;周達權指作為壹傳媒財務總裁-需向董事局主席黎智英匯報&quot;&gt;周達權指作為壹傳媒財務總裁 需向董事局主席黎智英匯報&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就周的職責，周指他作為壹傳媒的營運總裁，負責確保整個集團能夠營運，亦負責廣告營銷。此外，他會協助時任行政總裁張劍虹管理資訊科技部門。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而作為財務總裁，周負責管理公司財務部和其他後勤部門，例如行政部、發行部和法律部。他指在職線上，他需要向行政總裁張劍虹、壹傳媒集團董事局和董事局主席即黎智英匯報。周指，黎智英有時會就廣告方面提供意見，也會問及一些公司財務問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周達權指，黎智英名下有很多公司，包括力高顧問有限公司（Dico Consultants Limited）、加拿大公司 Lais Hotel Property Limited 和公明織造廠有限公司（Comitex Holdings Limited）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;周達權指由力高顧問財政事宜由黎智英或mark-simon決定&quot;&gt;周達權指由力高顧問財政事宜由黎智英或Mark Simon決定&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就力高顧問有限公司，周確認他在案發期間以信託形式持有力高的股份，即是代表黎智英持有股份，而黎則是另一名股東和董事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於力高的財務事宜，周稱乃由黎智英或 Mark Simon 其中一人有決定權，有時較細額的帳目則由時任壹傳媒行政總監黃偉強決定，例如公司名下的汽車續保、續牌以及日常行政事宜。除此之外，力高所有其他開支都需要黎或 Mark Simon 批准。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示力高的文件，顯示力高銀行帳戶的授權簽署人是黎智英、Mark Simon、周達權和洪志強。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;力高透過支票向陳梓華支付約8萬元-周達權表示簽署時不知道詳情&quot;&gt;力高透過支票向陳梓華支付約8萬元 周達權表示簽署時不知道詳情&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又展示由力高簽發的支票，顯示抬頭是陳梓華，款項為80,273港元，支票簽署人為周達權和 Mark Simon。周憶述，當時有一個付款要求，而黎智英亦批准了相關付款，財政部同事開了一張支票，周遂簽署。惟周並不知道為何要透過力高來付款，黎也沒有談及相關支票。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;據陳梓華早前證供，在他的英國和台北之旅之後，黎智英把陳和林姓女示威者的旅程相關費用，以支票形式歸還給他，款項合共為80,273元。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英於2019年6月向mark-simon支付300萬元-周達權稱用以籌辦項目惟不知詳情&quot;&gt;黎智英於2019年6月向Mark Simon支付300萬元 周達權稱用以籌辦項目惟不知詳情&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示2019年6月由周達權傳送給黎智英的電郵，顯示2019年5月黎的個人開支報表，其中一筆是給予 Mark Simon 的300萬款項，用來籌辦專案項目，另有一筆200萬美元款項由黎智英匯款至 Lais Hotel Property Limited。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就300萬元款項，周稱他理解是給予 Mark Simon 籌辦一些專案項目：「我理解嗰時2019年6月，可能都係用嚟做吓一啲海外文宣。」惟法官李運騰指周現在是作供，只需要說出他所知道的事情，而不要猜測。周遂表示，Mark Simon 並沒有告知他該300萬元的用途，而且周也不知道該300萬元是從哪一個銀行戶口支取。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示2019年7月的電郵，顯示黎智英在2019年6月的個人開支報表，其中有一筆85萬元美金匯款至加拿大。不過周則表示，因為事隔多年，他不記得自己有否經手這一筆匯款，也記不起誰人或哪個機構是加拿大那邊的收款人。此外，報表顯示黎向壹傳媒支付了一筆貸款。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;周達權指力高沒有實際生意-是黎智英自資營運的私人公司&quot;&gt;周達權指力高沒有實際生意 是黎智英自資營運的私人公司&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，周知不知道力高的性質是什麼，是一間商業上活躍的公司，還是一間空殻公司，或是一間持有物業的集團公司。周則稱，按他理解力商「冇乜實際 business」、「我記憶中係冇乜定期收入」，但是持有一些車和船，以及聘請了一些員工。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官問，那麼力高成立的目的是什麼。周僅表示：「呢間公司喺我接手之前，已經有好多年喇。」周又指，按他理解力高是黎智英的私人公司，由黎自資營運。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;周達權指黎智英轉讓名下離岸公司lacock作為陳梓華的酬勞&quot;&gt;周達權指黎智英轉讓名下離岸公司LACOCK作為陳梓華的「酬勞」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指黎智英名下有一個在英屬處女群島註冊的公司 LACOCK，在香港有一個匯豐銀行本地戶口。控方指，根據控辯雙方承認事實，在2018年4月26日至2020年1月13日之間，黎智英、Mark Simon 和周達權是 LACOCK 銀行戶口的授權簽署人。由2020年1月14日開始，該銀行戶口唯一授權簽署人轉為陳梓華。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周達權指，LACOCK是一間離岸公司，「我記得呢間公司係唔活躍。」他記得，大約在2016年1月1日至2019年中左右，公司董事有黎智英及他本人；不過他不肯定自己有否持有公司股份，還是以信託形式持有公司股份，即「掛名股東」，但是他可以肯定的是黎智英百份百擁有這間公司。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周供稱，在2019年9月處理 LACOCK 的轉讓手續期間，Mark Simon 曾告知他，「呢個陳梓華，幫阿黎生手做咗啲嘢」，所以黎把公司轉至陳梓華名下，「作為酬勞」，之後周便沒有追問下去。電郵紀錄顯示，轉名手續在2019年12月完成。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周達權作供未完，案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

On this basis, the authors evaluate the policy options for the United States.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-hong-kong-matters-to-the-united-states&quot;&gt;Why Hong Kong Matters to the United States&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong has been a valuable partner to the United States for decades, and consequently, the United States has an important stake in the city’s future. Hong Kong is the 15th-largest export market for the United States and a top destination for U.S. consumer products. As of 2023, approximately 1,300 U.S. companies were based in Hong Kong, with banks, law firms, accounting firms, and other financial services the most prominent among this group. What is more, roughly 84,000 Americans live in Hong Kong, while about 250,000 Hong Kong–born immigrants live in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong’s long-standing business climate — characterized by open markets, judicial independence, rule of law, and the free flow of information — has helped embed the city at the center of global trade and investment networks and positioned it as a critical interface between mainland China and the rest of the world. Hence, beyond the bilateral commercial and people-to-people ties, Hong Kong has served as an entrepôt between the United States and the rest of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), playing a critical role in trade, investment, finance, travel, and legal services. Until recently, the people of Hong Kong enjoyed considerable civil liberties relative to those in mainland cities. As a result, beyond the clear utilitarian value of how Hong Kong has benefited the United States and the world commercially, support for Hong Kong’s political pluralism and vitality — and the human rights of the city’s residents — had long been core to U.S. policy toward the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet since 2019, Beijing has taken major steps to significantly erode the once-high degree of political, judicial, and economic autonomy Hong Kong has enjoyed since its handover from the United Kingdom in 1997. The most dramatic of these moves was the imposition of a sweeping national security law in 2020, the Law of the People’s Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (NSL), which marked the key turning point of a years-long effort by Beijing to extend its de jure and de facto control over internal elements of the city’s governance and way of life. The move followed several years of increasing social activism and demands by Hong Kong residents on a range of issues, including for Chinese authorities to fulfill their pledge in the Basic Law to allow for universal suffrage by Hong Kong’s population for the members of the Legislative Council (LegCo) and the chief executive. With major protests emerging during the “Occupy Central” movement of 2014, Beijing began to tighten its grip, culminating in the harsh crackdown on pro-democracy protests and marches in 2019. Authorities followed the NSL with electoral reforms to ensure that Hong Kong is governed by “patriots,” thereby disqualifying many viable candidates for no other reason than the perception that they are not sufficiently “pro-Beijing.” With these concerted legal and political efforts, capped by the recently adopted Article 23–based Safeguarding National Security Ordinance, Beijing has gone a long way to undermining Hong Kong’s “high degree of autonomy” promised in the Joint Declaration, weakening the civil liberties of its residents, and degrading the independence of its legal and judiciary system. Taken in total, these developments have substantially eroded the “One Country, Two Systems” (一国两制) framework that has been in place since 1997 and was supposed to remain intact until 2047, casting a pall over the city’s future as a regional — and global — financial and economic hub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing’s erosion of the “One Country, Two Systems” framework came at an inflection point in U.S.-China ties. When the NSL was adopted, Washington and Beijing were sparring over the origins of Covid-19, but tensions had grown in prior years. The Trump administration had jettisoned strategic engagement in favor of a more punitive approach, reflecting built-up frustration in Washington over China’s unfair trade practices, growing regional assertiveness, deteriorating domestic human rights conditions, and increased economic coercion. The events of 2019–2020 also took place amid growing concern in Washington about the centralization of decisionmaking authority in China’s political system under Xi Jinping and the entrenchment of a statist, security-driven approach to economic and political governance on the mainland. Since 2014, the Xi administration had been centralizing power in party organizations and overhauling the mainland’s national security architecture to address a host of perceived external and internal threats, while continuing to advance the country’s international power and influence. Anti-corruption campaigns targeting political rivals, a suite of new security policies, and crackdowns on civil society were part of this push.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against the backdrop of these developments, Washington and partner capitals tracked the growing activism and protests of 2019 and the subsequent 2020 NSL closely. Congress and the Trump administration quickly enacted punitive measures on individuals and entities involved in eroding Hong Kong’s autonomy, signaled support for the human rights and civil liberties of Hong Kong’s residents, and began to pare back privileges granted to the special administrative region (SAR) based on an expectation of its sustained autonomy — for example, by curbing differential treatment for Hong Kong relative to mainland China under U.S. export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid growing U.S.-China tensions on other issues ranging from technology to Taiwan, as well as the ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, Hong Kong features less prominently in today’s policy conversations. Its Covid-19 control policies arguably compounded this problem, as few international travelers could visit the city for three years. As a result, international perspectives on Hong Kong risk being out of step with the reality on the ground. With that in mind, this report aims to provide an objective analysis of Hong Kong’s status based on on-the-ground discussions with various stakeholders in the city, open-source research, and consultations with the business community, policymakers, and the Hong Kong diaspora.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two of the coauthors (Blanchette and Kennedy) visited Hong Kong in September 2023, and over nine days conducted 35 interviews with a wide range of stakeholders, including representatives from the Hong Kong government, former Hong Kong government officials, members of the LegCo, executives from local and multinational companies and financial institutions, university professors, local and international journalists, NGO leaders, and public interest legal experts. Interviews were also conducted with experts, members of the overseas Hong Kong community, and U.S. policymakers before and after this trip. These discussions were supplemented by wide reading of primary and secondary sources about Hong Kong, China, and U.S.-China relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of this project is to understand ongoing developments in Hong Kong’s political, legal, and economic environment; likely implications for the city’s future as a global business hub; and the options available for U.S. policymakers to preserve a productive relationship that advances U.S. commercial interests and is supportive of any remaining autonomy, consistent with Beijing’s international commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several key findings of this report:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An authoritarian turn in China under Xi Jinping has significantly eroded Hong Kong’s “high degree of autonomy” that was supposed to be maintained until 2047. These challenges are compounded by divisions within the SAR about its appropriate roles within China (and globally) due to growing U.S.-China geostrategic tensions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There remains some resilience of autonomy, and life in Hong Kong is qualitatively different than in other mainland Chinese jurisdictions. However, the overall trend is clearly in the direction of further erosion of autonomy across nearly all domains — the legal and political system and civil society, as well as the climate for companies and investors. Not all of this erosion can be captured quantitatively. Such change does not become obvious until one sees how on-the-ground actors are adjusting — often in subtle ways — to a new political-legal reality.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The U.S. government should reevaluate its current approach to Hong Kong and consider some adjustments. Its policy should be rooted in a pragmatic understanding of what strategies are likely to be most productive (or counterproductive) for U.S. interests and Hong Kong’s autonomy and resilience, rather than symbolic measures. The choice is between three broad policy alternatives:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Penalization. This approach would enact punitive measures against the individuals and entities most closely involved in the erosions of Hong Kong’s autonomy, seeking to raise the costs to Beijing for its behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Resignation. This would assume that Washington and partners are powerless to change clear trends toward erosion in Hong Kong’s autonomy, and it would seek to remove, incrementally, all policy exemptions giving the SAR special treatment under U.S. law.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strategic Engagement. This more proactive approach would seek to extend the SAR’s distinctiveness — and its remaining autonomy — within the PRC for as long as possible, by solidifying practical interactions between state and non-state actors in the United States and Hong Kong but also, when necessary, using punitive measures in a more targeted manner.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-pathway-to-the-current-dilemmas-over-hong-kong&quot;&gt;The Pathway to the Current Dilemmas over Hong Kong&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After over 150 years of British rule, Hong Kong reverted to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. This followed the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration (“Joint Declaration”), which set the conditions for this transfer. Beijing committed to permit Hong Kong a “high degree of autonomy” from the mainland for five decades, except in foreign affairs and defense. Beijing frames this arrangement as “One Country, Two Systems,” a national unification policy Deng Xiaoping outlined for Taiwan and Hong Kong in the early 1980s. Pursuant to the Joint Declaration, China’s National People’s Congress (NPC) enacted the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administration Region of the People’s Republic of China (“Basic Law”) in 1990, a de facto “mini-constitution” for Hong Kong. The Basic Law enshrined this “One Country, Two Systems” arrangement for Hong Kong’s governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For roughly two decades after returning to China’s control, the city enjoyed a relatively high degree of autonomy, facilitating its prosperity and success as a global business hub. Even as China, under Xi Jinping, took a more pronounced authoritarian turn beginning in 2013, Hong Kong’s courts, its civic freedoms, and its economic and regulatory environment all possessed relative autonomy. U.S. policy toward Hong Kong largely reflected this. Under the 1992 United States-Hong Kong Policy Act (USHKPA), Washington treated the Hong Kong SAR as distinct from the rest of China in trade, finance, immigration, and other fields based on the assumption that China was committed to maintaining the city’s autonomy through 2047. The USHKPA was designed to bolster the SAR’s autonomy through this distinct treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Beijing had incrementally made tactical curtailments of Hong Kong’s freedoms in the initial decade after the handover in 1997, its efforts intensified from the mid-2010s. These efforts fueled sequential local protests in Hong Kong. In 2012, for example, more than 90,000 residents, by one estimate, took to the streets to oppose proposed amendments to the city’s school curriculum intended to foster Chinese national identity. In 2014, hundreds of thousands came out to support universal suffrage as part of the “Umbrella Movement” — named for the use of umbrellas to defend against police pepper spray. A new high in public protest was reached in 2019, in response to a Beijing-endorsed legislative proposal to enable extradition to mainland China of criminals accused in Hong Kong. Then chief executive Carrie Lam later withdrew the proposal, but the repression of protestors drew global attention. As a result, the pro-democracy movement received greater public support; in the November 2019 district council elections, voters delivered the pro-democracy camp a majority of seats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This marked a turning point in Beijing’s approach, with the Xi administration apparently feeling that there was a political crisis emerging that could no longer be managed through traditional means and that fulfilling Beijing’s original pledge to maintain Hong Kong’s autonomy and widen suffrage would undermine China’s sovereignty over the city and erode Chinese Communist Party (CCP) control. In June 2020, the NPC Standing Committee bypassed Hong Kong’s legislature to impose sweeping national security legislation on the city. The NSL sent shockwaves through Hong Kong and the international community owing to its expansive conception of national security. It adopted broad and vague definitions for crimes such as subversion, terrorism, secession, and collusion with foreign forces, and it effectively criminalized public dissent of any variety. In the years since, the law has been used to disqualify pro-democracy candidates from public office, decimate opposition parties, curb media freedoms, and quiet public complaints about central government erosion of Hong Kong’s autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The events of 2019–2020, particularly the adoption of the NSL, accentuated the polarization of views among Hong Kong residents about the city’s future in ways that have continued in the years since. A central theme of this debate is over what it means to preserve Hong Kong’s way of life. Pro-establishment stakeholders highlight that Hong Kong has never been fully autonomous or a multi-party democracy in which political leaders were chosen through open elections. Moreover, in their view, Hong Kong residents are apolitical, and they value stability most of all. The push for universal elections, for this camp, is a deviation from the past and tantamount to advocating for a Hong Kong that is entirely independent from the PRC. Those who identify more with the opposition or “pro-democracy” camp point to the fact that although Hong Kong was never a democracy due to British rule, the city has a long history of rule of law, a vigorous civil society, an independent media, an open economy, and direct elections for a portion of the city’s political leadership. In their view, the move toward universal suffrage and opposition to the NSL was important for consolidating and protecting these underlying features of the city’s life. This division about the essence of Hong Kong and its future was on full display during this project’s interviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;signs-of-resilience-and-erosion-of-autonomy&quot;&gt;Signs of Resilience and Erosion of Autonomy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;defining-autonomy&quot;&gt;Defining Autonomy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of the 2023 trip was to assess how Beijing’s tightened grip has affected the city’s autonomy and to evaluate confidence among key stakeholders, such as foreign and domestic businesses, university faculty and students, and the general public, about the city’s future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One challenge in assessing the degree of backsliding in Hong Kong is formulating a clear conception of “autonomy” and determining what would constitute a “high degree” of local discretion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this analysis, autonomy can be conceptualized in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, differences in the way of life between mainland China and Hong Kong, in terms of political liberties, the legal system, social norms, and economic openness — in other words, the extent to which a “One Country, Two Systems” framework is evident in practice. The narrower the gap between these “systems,” the less autonomy there is for Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, the authority Hong Kong officials and members of society have to make their own decisions about the city’s way of life and its system. The more authority for keeping (or changing) this system that lies in Beijing, the less autonomy the SAR has.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two ways of measuring autonomy were referenced when evaluating trends in the city’s status. Through interviews, review of primary documents, and further research, this report identifies signs of retained resilience but also clear erosion of autonomy across three key areas: governance, the economy, and civil society. While in every instance it is a mixed picture, in most domains, more signs of erosion than resilience were evident, and the general trajectory is toward continued erosion going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;legal-and-political-environment&quot;&gt;Legal and Political Environment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ELECTORAL SYSTEM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most obvious loss of autonomy since 2020 is in Hong Kong’s political environment. Far from moving toward universal suffrage as promised under the Basic Law, Beijing now has almost total control of the selection of Hong Kong government authorities. Much of this relates to the adoption and implementation of the NSL and the use of older colonial-era laws to crack down on freedom of association and expression, as well as a set of electoral changes that were enacted in 2021. As one interlocutor shared, these reforms were designed to intentionally remove the “electoral” element from Hong Kong’s political system. Candidates must now be vetted for political loyalty to Beijing, with the aim of a city governed by “patriots.” In addition, the LegCo has been expanded (from 70 to 90 seats), while the number of seats elected directly by Hong Kong residents has been reduced (from 35 to 20). Further, the power of an election committee composed largely of Beijing-controlled organizations to vet and choose legislative candidates has been expanded. Later “reforms” to district council elections in 2023 likewise dramatically reduced the number of seats chosen directly by the populace (from around 90 percent, or 452 of 479, to around 20 percent, or 88 of 470), with most of the remainder chosen by the chief executive and government-appointed committees. Candidates up for election via direct vote must still be vetted for their political loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pro-democracy representation was largely snuffed out by the introduction of these rules, in effect disqualifying those with a history of criticizing Beijing or the Hong Kong government for departing from the political reforms promised in the Basic Law. Simultaneous to these electoral changes, pro-democracy lawmakers were detained for charges under the NSL. In 2021 (the latest LegCo election), only one non-establishment candidate was elected, representing a dramatic drop from 2016, when pro-democracy and centrist or localist candidates won a third of seats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several interlocutors suggested that these changes move Hong Kong’s legislature and district council closer to the mainland’s NPC model, with representation controlled from the top down and no real resistance to proposals from Beijing. Elections for seats in the legislative council and district council continue to be contested, but voter interest has declined precipitously in line with pre-vetting of candidates. In the recent district elections of December 2023, for example, voter turnout stood at a mere 27.5 percent, a new record low, down from a high of 71 percent in 2019 amid the pro-democracy protests. Turnout at the 2021 LegCo elections was a record low of 30.2 percent, down from 58 percent in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RULE OF LAW AND JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong’s strong rule of law tradition has long served as the backbone of its economic success, and in fact Hong Kong’s legal system remains qualitatively different from the one on the mainland in some important ways. Conservative voices interviewed for this report suggested that the then-forthcoming national security legislation, as stipulated under Article 23 of the Basic Law, would be necessary in part because Beijing has shown restraint in exercising its privileges to impose national laws on the SAR. For example, Beijing has not extended its Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law or Counter-Espionage Law to Hong Kong. Interlocutors in this Beijing-leaning group also cited Xi Jinping’s 2022 speech emphasizing that Hong Kong remains a Common Law system as evidence that Beijing is committed to preserving Hong Kong’s legal system and judicial independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, some suggested that Hong Kong’s national security law is not out of step with international practice; many Commonwealth of Nations countries have national security legislation of some variety. They highlighted specifics around the implementation and scope of the 2020 NSL — such as the fact that issuance of charges, warrants, and arrests under the law have been public and visible — to suggest that the legal system remains transparent. Of course, in these countries, national security legislation is embedded in an independent rule of law system that is accountable to voters and faces scrutiny from an independent media, so the comparison has only a superficial logic. Perhaps the most important distinction is that Hong Kong increasingly has less discretion to define its own local national security concerns in the face of Xi Jinping’s expansive framework of the “holistic view of national security” (国家安全观). While the final Article 23 national security law did not contain any references to Xi or his “outlook,” the “public consultation” document released in January by the Hong Kong government made explicit reference to both Xi and his “holistic view of national security.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One important measure of judicial independence is a record of court rulings that go against the Hong Kong government and the clear interests of Beijing. In a prominent case this past year, a judge blocked a government effort to ban the broadcast or distribution of “Glory to Hong Kong,” a song largely understood as an unofficial protest anthem, on online platforms such as YouTube. In recent years, Hong Kong’s courts have also fended off government challenges to the rights of same-sex couples. As another example, the Court of Final Appeal, the city’s highest court, overturned the conviction of a journalist accused of making false statements to access car registration records while investigating attacks on pro-democracy protestors in 2019. Despite high-profile departures in the years since the 2020 NSL, foreigners still serve as judges in Hong Kong’s Court of Final Appeal and foreign law firms remain among the most respected in the city, representing clients on a wide variety of issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Establishes new committee responsible for managing national security affairs in Hong Kong (12), chaired by the SAR chief executive (13) but supervised by and accountable to the central government in Beijing (12) — including through direct oversight by Beijing-vetted secretary-general (13) and national security advisor (15). Committee’s work is not subject to judicial review (14).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Sets up a powerful new central government office tasked with overseeing and supporting national security affairs in the SAR (48–53), with the power to take over national security cases in certain instances (55–56).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Vests power of interpretation of the NSL in the NPC Standing Committee (65).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Extends to a vast jurisdiction, including to alleged violations by non–Hong Kong residents overseas (38).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Requires all candidates for public office to swear oath of allegiance to the SAR (6) — a more expansive provision than in the Basic Law — and disqualifies those convicted for national security–related charges from running in elections (35).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Circumvents due process in trial procedures, including removing presumptive approval of bail (42), closed trials in certain instances (41), and appointment/removal of judges by the chief executive (44).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Commits the SAR to promoting national security education among public, including in schools, universities, and civil society organizations, in the media, on the internet (10).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Note: The numbers in parentheses refer to the relevant articles of the NSL. Source: Information gathered from the 2020 National Security Law.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, while Hong Kong’s legal system may remain qualitatively different than that of mainland China, there are signs of substantial erosion. The 2020 NSL clearly pared back judicial independence as well as due process. One need only look at the administrative build-out of NSL governance and security architecture, which formalizes Beijing’s influence over judicial affairs in the city when national security, broadly and vaguely defined, is concerned. The NSL stood up a new committee equipped with broad authority for national security matters in the SAR, led by the Beijing-aligned chief executive, accountable to and supervised by Beijing, and not subject to judicial review. Local authorities may hand-select personnel in law enforcement and prosecution to manage national security cases and appoint and remove judges to hear national security cases. The Hong Kong government may conduct NSL-related trials without a jury. The central government in Beijing also stood up an office to monitor national security matters in the SAR, and it can take over NSL cases under certain circumstances, including where a “foreign country or external elements” are involved. The NSL rests power of interpretation with the NPC Standing Committee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simultaneous with the build-out of the NSL architecture, older legislation has been repurposed to cover security-related crimes not covered by the NSL itself, including a colonial-era sedition law that remained dormant for 50 years. A large number of opposition activists and politicians have been pursued under the NSL and related ordinances in recent years. As of February 23, 2024, 291 people had been arrested for suspected activity endangering national security since the NSL was enacted. Of these, 174 individuals (and five companies) have been charged under either the NSL or other laws, and 111 have been convicted or await sentencing; 32 have been convicted or await sentencing under the NSL. Cash bounties have been issued for information leading to arrest of least 13 opposition figures and activists overseas, compounding an environment of fear even for activists who manage to escape Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first large-scale case under the NSL came in February 2021, when 47 pro-democracy activists were charged with “conspiracy to commit subversion” for efforts to improve pro-democrats’ electoral chances and force a positive government response to the ongoing protests. Of the 47 charged, 31 pleaded guilty. The trial for the 16 pleading not guilty began in February 2023, almost two years later. Their trial had no jury, and the three presiding judges were all appointed by the chief executive (with approval of a Beijing-controlled committee) under the NSL. Another prominent and ongoing case involves Jimmy Lai, a UK citizen and a long-standing critic of Beijing, charged under the NSL on counts of colluding with foreign forces and, under the sedition law, with publishing seditious material. Lai founded the Apple Daily, among the most popular newspapers in Hong Kong, which ran until June 2021, when it was forced to close after Hong Kong authorities raided and froze the assets of its publishing company under authority of the NSL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local lawyers suggest there is insufficient due process for those accused of security-related crimes. Authorities have the power to detain defendants indefinitely without bail as long as the crime in question is a national security–related one. Trials and pretrial detention times for political charges have been lengthy. Some of the “Hong Kong 47” defendants, for example, were jailed for nearly two years before their trial began. Jimmy Lai spent over 1,000 days in pre-trial detention. His trial was slated to begin December 2022, but was delayed a year after Hong Kong authorities rejected his choice of legal representation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual adoption in March 2024 of the Article 23–based national security ordinance provides additional evidence of the erosion of the SAR’s political autonomy. Local advocates argue that an additional version was needed to fill in the gaps of the 2020 laws passed by the NPC, to account for additional kinds of violations, including colluding with external forces, insurrection, sedition, and espionage. Moreover, they emphasize that because of Hong Kong’s Common Law system, implementation of the law would align with Hong Kong’s historic respect of due process. That said, the law is far from reassuring. It was sprung on the public with little warning, rushed through its review, and adopted by a LegCo bereft of diverse voices in a vote of 89–0. There is sufficient vagueness in terms such as “state secrets” and “external forces” that could give the Hong Kong government substantial leeway in charging and prosecuting defendants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Builds on 2020 NSL by targeting five offenses, broadly and vaguely defined — treason, insurrection, sabotage, “external interference,” and theft of state secrets and espionage (parts 2–6).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Empowers the chief executive to make subsidiary legislation deemed necessary to protect national security (110).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Gives police and courts power to extend pre-charge detention period, restrict access to lawyers in certain cases (76–78).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Allows major offenses, such as “sabotage” and “external interference,” to apply to persons for activities committed outside of Hong Kong (9).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Moves toward mainland’s broad definition of “state secrets,” to include “secrets” on the economic, technological, and social development of mainland China or the SAR (29).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;References “external interference” frequently throughout, consistent with SAR officials’ emphasis on protecting the city from “foreign forces.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DAY-TO-DAY GOVERNANCE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interlocutors shared various perspectives on the degree to which Hong Kong operates autonomously from Beijing in terms of day-to-day governance. One former top official suggested that the fact that the People’s Liberation Army has never been called on to intervene is a sign of Hong Kong’s sustained autonomy. Another former official emphasized a need for realism about the extent of autonomy that Hong Kong as “a local city,” like any city within China, would be granted under the PRC system (which is not a federal system). On the other side of the equation, interlocutors noted that Hong Kong’s civil servants are largely trained to be apolitical, which means they are not able to defend their self-interest and authority when challenged. Two interview sources outside the government suggested that self-censorship among authorities in Hong Kong is on the rise, and although officials may not be receiving direct orders from Beijing, they see it within their professional interests to try to guess what Beijing’s preferences are and to adapt accordingly. Such a dynamic, which is also not uncommon in the mainland, leads to officials often taking more hardline stances than Beijing has requested or potentially desires. While some interlocutors indicated that this dynamic is part of an “adjustment period” as Hong Kong navigates the post-NSL period, it seems likely that this is a lasting, not transient, trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economy-and-business-environment&quot;&gt;Economy and Business Environment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FINANCE AND MONETARY POLICY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong has long had among the world’s most vibrant financial sectors, which represents almost a quarter of the city’s GDP and employs over 7 percent of its population. Local authorities clearly want to preserve this reputation. Monetary policy, macro-prudential regulation, governance of the securities market, and maintaining the peg of the Hong Kong dollar to the U.S. dollar appear largely unchanged since the imposition of the NSL. Innovation in the financial sector remains a focus. Hong Kong is, for example, building out regulatory infrastructure for crypto assets. The city government has issued green bonds that align incentives in favor of decarbonization and instituted disclosure requirements to promote environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals. Government interlocutors pointed to Hong Kong’s role in resolving a U.S.-China audit dispute in 2022 — inspectors from the U.S. audit watchdog Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) reviewed Chinese audit documents on the ground in Hong Kong — to suggest the city was poised to remain a bridge between the mainland and international markets in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, financial sector resilience is not guaranteed. Political instability is a key concern for investors. Many clients of Hong Kong’s private wealth managers, for example, including clients from mainland China, have relocated assets away from the city to the benefit of other regional hubs such as Singapore. Looking ahead, foreign and local businesses and investors have expressed concern that Article 23 and uncertainties associated with broad definitions of key terms like “state secrets” may complicate the picture, jeopardizing research and acquisition of economic and financial data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond this, greater financial integration of Hong Kong and mainland China and involvement from Beijing in this integration are clear trends. “Stock connect” programs, launched before the NSL, enable cross-border investments between Hong Kong and mainland markets. These require extensive consultations with the central government and creation of special systems to allow funds from mainland China to enter Hong Kong’s capital market and economy. In mid-2023, the Hong Kong stock exchange introduced RMB-denominated shares, potentially aiding Beijing’s efforts to drive up use of the Chinese yuan overseas. In January 2024, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority introduced further measures to deepen financial links with the mainland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE REAL ECONOMY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trends in the real economy are a mixed picture. Hong Kong’s economy is still dominated by local private firms and remains deeply connected to global supply chains. The city’s formal approach to international commercial engagement has been stable since 2019, with few formal restrictions on flows of goods and capital. According to U.S. consul general Gregory May, foreign businesses have also been largely spared non-tariff barriers to trade (unlike the situation on the mainland). Businesses involved in pro-democracy activism have encountered trouble, but Hong Kong remains a substantially freer economy than the mainland (ranked second globally in a long-running index).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong authorities appear determined to retain this status, and they still clearly consider the city the connective tissue linking China and the rest of the world — not just through trade but also through arts, sciences, and technology. Hong Kong has signed 250 bilateral agreements with other countries in areas covering trade, taxation, and investment protection and promotion. The SAR is applying to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). Chief Executive John Lee frequently refers to the city as a “super-connector” in China’s international relationships (aligning with terminology deployed by Beijing).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even so, research for this report revealed declining autonomy in many areas that will likely jeopardize Hong Kong’s economic resilience going forward. Local officials with whom the authors spoke were careful not to directly criticize Beijing’s economic policies. They blamed the pandemic and U.S.-China tensions for Hong Kong’s economic troubles over the past years, not policies from Beijing. Similarly, the authors witnessed limited willingness of officials and others in Hong Kong to offer alternative estimates of China’s economic growth rate or challenges that differ from official data and positions. Such differing assessments were common in the authors’ previous engagements with Hong Kong officials in the pre-NSL period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong is aligning with the positions of mainland China in international economic bodies as well. In 2021, Hong Kong stepped in to block the election of an official representing “Chinese Taipei” (the name Taiwan uses when participating in international bodies) to serve as the chair of the World Trade Organization (WTO) government procurement committee, aligning with Beijing’s declared position. The election was uncontested and most other parties were in support. Pro-Beijing interlocutors claimed the Hong Kong position was made on its own, not directed by Beijing. But many capitals have warned that such trends amplify Beijing’s voice in international bodies. Further, interviews also revealed that Hong Kong authorities do not believe Chinese Taipei has a right to join the RCEP — another sign of alignment with Beijing’s positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, the SAR government is driving forward greater economic integration with the mainland, a trend that aligns with the Xi administration’s articulated priorities for the national economy. Many interlocutors highlighted the “Greater Bay Area” (GBA), which connects Hong Kong, Macau, and nine cities in Guangdong, and they identified specific policies designed to promote regional integration and innovation. One was the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Cooperation Zone, announced in 2017, which follows a “one zone, two parks” model purportedly to reflect a “One Country, Two Systems” framework. Yet the clear intent is to reduce the relevance of the boundary between Hong Kong and the mainland. Beijing has been explicit about leveraging Hong Kong’s international reputation and positioning to advance national priorities, such as industrial and technology upgrading. Indeed, the GBA intends to incubate technology companies and research institutes in areas critical to Xi’s high-tech vision, such as semiconductors, AI, aerospace, and biomedical technology. Yet when various Hong Kong officials were asked how coordination within and among the GBA localities would work, there was little by way of concrete — or convincing — answers. It is arguably the case that Beijing would play a key role in facilitating GBA integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jI3mZ8V.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relatedly, interviews for this report demonstrated greater interest than ever before among Hong Kong authorities in the need for industrial policy to promote the city’s role in various industries, including ICT and pharma. Government interlocutors referred frequently to “blueprints” and “plans” for R&amp;amp;D and innovation, including joint efforts with the mainland. Despite making integration with Shenzhen and other mainland cities in the GBA a priority, officials were hard pressed to marshal evidence that the initiative would actually strengthen Hong Kong’s economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a sign of closer integration, for the first time in at least 30 years companies from the mainland with regional headquarters in Hong Kong outnumbered U.S. ones in 2022. U.S. firms operating in Hong Kong have fallen continuously in the past years, reflecting growing anxiety among the U.S. business community. Eighty percent of U.S. businesses surveyed by the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) HK in late 2021 said the NSL had impacted their operations. While many U.S. firms and investors plan to remain in the city, less than a third of U.S. companies surveyed by AmCham HK at the end of 2023 planned to expand investment in the next two years. Aside from U.S.-China ties and a slowing Chinese economy, challenges related to the political and legal environment ranked high among the list of complaints. Some business travelers now revert to “burner” devices when traveling to Hong Kong — mirroring a common practice for the mainland — due to concerns about government surveillance. Crackdowns on due-diligence and consulting firms on the mainland, including the Mintz Group and Capvision, and Beijing’s increasingly draconian approach to security have not helped investor confidence in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;civil-society&quot;&gt;Civil Society&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space for Hong Kong’s once vibrant civil society has shrunk substantially in the past years. According to major indices tracking freedom of expression, assembly, and association, Hong Kong’s position has worsened substantially since 2020, although the situation remains qualitatively different from any mainland city. Criminal charges under the NSL and other security-related legislation, high-profile detainments, and the risk of legal difficulties have led to the closure of many independent news outlets and NGOs either by force or preemptively, while journalists, academics, and activists operate in an environment of self-censorship and fear. This trend has accelerated in the wake of the Article 23 national security law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NGOs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to NGO interlocutors, conditions have deteriorated considerably, and NGOs are reportedly dissuaded informally from engaging in policy advocacy. Many civil society organizations, particularly those with international connections, have been forced to disband or relocate. A 2023 report from Amnesty International estimated over 100 civil society organizations have left or been shut down since the enactment of the NSL in July 2020. The group itself famously closed its two offices in Hong Kong in October 2021, citing the NSL which “made it effectively impossible for human rights organizations in Hong Kong to work freely and without fear of serious reprisals from the government.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For civil society groups that continue to operate in Hong Kong, barriers to resourcing and operations have grown. Amended guidelines for charitable groups specify that any group that “takes part in acts or activities . . . contrary to the interests of national security” will not be qualified (or will be disqualified) as a charitable organization. The bounds of acceptable behavior have become more uncertain, given the vague and expanding definition of national security and sensitivity to it under both national security laws and related legislation. Civil society organizations report challenges in obtaining essential services, as providers increasingly worry about running afoul of security restrictions, according to those interviewed for this report. Those receiving international funds, hiring non-local staff, or having overseas connections worry about the potential application of the joint national security laws (which cover foreign collusion) to their work. In a high-profile case illustrative of government paranoia and associated risks for NGOs around foreign engagement, Hong Kong national security authorities in March 2022 pursued a UK-based NGO (Hong Kong Watch) for breach of the NSL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MEDIA AND PUBLISHING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Media freedoms are also generally on a downward trend, although local and international journalists interviewed felt that the reporting environment in Hong Kong is still more open than in the rest of China. This is a relatively low bar, however, given that Beijing has kicked out a substantial portion of the U.S. press corps in the mainland. Hong Kong’s English and Chinese press still run stories about Chinese politics, economics, and society that would not be able to run in the mainland. Journalists remain able to conduct interviews and cover most events largely free of harassment, interlocutors shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, the NSL and the revival of colonial era anti-sedition laws have left a clear mark. On an index of press freedom from Reporters Without Borders, Hong Kong dropped from 58th in 2013 to 140th in 2023, of the 180 countries and territories included. Prominent independent news outlets have been forced to close, with leadership staff arrested. Most notable was Apple Daily in June 2021, but Stand News (a free online news site that adopted a generally pro-democracy editorial position) was also forcefully shut down that year. At least five other independent media outlets chose to close, citing heightened risks for staff. Public broadcaster Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) overhauled its programming under new pro-government management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign publications have gotten in trouble for routine coverage of political events. Hong Kong authorities, for example, reprimanded the Wall Street Journal and New York Times in December 2021 for publishing op-eds on Beijing’s bid to prevent low turnout during the city’s inaugural “patriots only” LegCo election that month and warned they may be guilty of “incitement.” Some journalists shared that the breadth of stories Hong Kong media can cover has narrowed significantly, particularly concerning sensitive topics such as the Hong Kong government, the question of autonomy, and the NSL. Corporate and government records once available to journalists have been shut down or made more difficult to access, interlocutors shared. Foreign journalists who covered the 2019 pro-democracy protests have had visa applications or renewals denied. The New York Times, prominently, moved a third of its Hong Kong–based staff to Seoul following imposition of the 2020 NSL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changes have contributed to a climate of fear and self-censorship. The Foreign Correspondents’ Club of Hong Kong, for example, suspended its annual Human Rights Press Awards in 2022 out of concern that its plans to recognize the pro-democracy outlet Stand News would put staff and members at risk under the NSL and anti-sedition law. A string of arrests under the laws have accentuated the climate, including most notably that of Jimmy Lai. Some journalists and editors simply choose to avoid stories that may be seen by the Hong Kong government or Beijing as too sensitive even in the absence of any codified prohibition. Better safe than sorry is a posture that many have adopted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While bookstores still have a range of books, particularly in English, the spectrum of views in Chinese-language books and periodicals in particular has narrowed considerably, as has the distance between the types of material that one would find in Hong Kong versus mainland Chinese bookstores. There are no longer books available that dig into the professional and personal lives of Chinese officials, for example, and there is a narrower range of books on China’s political history. Instead, more copies of the collected works of Xi Jinping and CCP documents fill the shelves of bookstores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UNIVERSITIES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At universities, the formal tenure and promotion systems, open library access, and curriculum structure largely remain intact from the pre-NSL days. Some university leaders (presidents, provosts, and deans) have shown substantial courage to protect their universities, schools, programs, and students while faced with significant external pressure to limit research, push out heterodox views and faculty, and circumscribe debate and exploration among students. One source said that the worst time for university life was in 2020–2021, but that the situation has stabilized since then. A dependable source said that law schools have been largely able to preserve academic freedom, with their curriculum remaining the same as prior to 2019. Cooperation remains between Hong Kong law schools and those in the West, including the University of Pennsylvania, Harvard, and Columbia, among others, one source shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although formal systems protecting academic freedom remain intact, both external and internal pressures threaten the future of Hong Kong’s globally respected universities. There has been substantial pressure on universities to voluntarily introduce “patriotic” coursework to stay in the good graces of city authorities and Beijing. In August 2022, after Xi visited Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Education Bureau distributed thousands of copies of his speech to schools across the city. Interviews with relevant parties revealed that the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) “reorganized” its Universities Service Center for Chinese Studies to make its collection of Chinese documents unavailable to scholars in Hong Kong, and that online forums for students and teachers have been closed down or made unavailable in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Informal pressures on academics to self-censor have grown. Interlocutors said that on some campuses, “patriotic” faculty members have started social media and whisper campaigns to attack other faculty members and block promotions, some of whom have responded by leaving those universities and Hong Kong altogether. Prominent scholars have faced disciplinary action from Hong Kong authorities or from universities themselves. Soon after NSL enactment, the University of Hong Kong’s governing board moved to fire key 2019 protest organizer Benny Tai under pressure from pro-Beijing lawmakers. Academics now worry about being overlooked for tenure or having their contracts cut short for political expression. University community members interviewed for this report also expressed concerns about the how the Article 23 NSL, which had yet to be passed at that point, could further chill Hong Kong’s research environment by adding uncertainty about what topics and research methods may violate national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These changes have catalyzed a brain drain and created a less robust and diverse academic ecosystem. Indeed, research showed that most new applicants for open positions in social sciences and humanities are PRC citizens with Western academic training, with a major drop in applications from scholars from Europe and North America. One of Hong Kong academia’s traditional strengths is that it attracted top-tier talent from around the world, so a diminishment of that advantage would be a great detriment to the city’s human capital. The 2022–2023 period saw the highest turnover in 20 years at Hong Kong’s eight government-funded universities, with 380 academics leaving, marking a 7.6 percent increase from the year before. Quality scholarship on a range of issues beyond domestic Chinese politics and society is at stake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FREEDOM OF RELIGION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the 2020 NSL and the 2024 Article 23 national security ordinance raise worrying questions about the protection of religious freedom in Hong Kong. In October 2022, Pastor Garry Pang Moon-yuen was jailed for a total of 13 months after being found guilty of sedition and seditious speech. In May 2022, 90-year-old cardinal Joseph Zen Ze-kiun was arrested under the NSL on the charge of “collusion with foreign forces.” Later that year, Zen and five others were found guilty of failing to register a fund that supported individuals arrested in connection with the 2019 protests. Given the focus from the twin national security laws on punishing individuals who support or aid ill-defined “external interference,” the space for Hong Kong’s vibrant Catholic community is certainly at risk, given that it communes directly with Rome (as opposed to the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association in the mainland). As Cardinal Stephen Chow Sau-yan stated in a 2023 interview, “If you come out with something that violates the national security law, then that’s a problem.” He added, “In the past, you could freely say whatever you want. Now you have to be careful how you say it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong is not yet like a regular city in mainland China, but the trajectory is clear and worrying. Areas of resilience remain, but in ways that look largely unsustainable, for example, coming down to the impressively brave behavior of discrete individuals, such as university administrators fighting off curriculum changes. As one analyst shared, Hong Kong is perhaps closer to how Chinese cities operated in 2004–2005 under Hu Jintao: when governance was less ideologically oppressive, there were more open consultations with government authorities, civil society organizations were constrained but growing, and village leaders were chosen through direct elections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The text of the Joint Declaration and elements of the Basic Law indicate that Hong Kong has certain political, social, and economic rules and practices that will remain different from the rest of China, and the decision of whether (and how) to change them rests in part with the officials and people of Hong Kong. However, the reality appears to be that when push comes to shove — both figuratively and literally — the extent of autonomy that Hong Kong authorities have is determined unilaterally by Beijing. Hong Kong can propose how the boundary is drawn and what powers its officials have, but it can only do so through requests. In an interview for CSIS’s China Field Notes podcast, LegCo member Regina Ip noted that Hong Kong could make proposals to and have consultations with Beijing, but that policy across a wide range of domains was ultimately at Beijing’s discretion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within Hong Kong, there is debate about the city’s future and whether the developments of the past years have been positive or negative. There is a clear divide between conservatives, who believe Hong Kong is finally stable and better than it has ever been, and liberals, who believe the city’s vitality is in the process of being snuffed out. One person with a conservative perspective said, for example, that “the ‘one country’ part of ‘one country, two systems’ was ignored by everyone, but things are much better now.” By contrast, liberals are deeply disheartened. One shared that they feel Hong Kong now is a “semi-police state.” They sense a drumbeat toward the city’s “mainlandization.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The distribution of views on these issues is difficult to discern. For one, elections no longer address these questions. Campaigns at the district level, for example, largely focus on bread-and-butter issues with debates about Hong Kong’s degree of autonomy and critiques of Beijing’s oversight largely off limits. Low turnout at elections since the NSL may reflect silent protest, but it may also simply reflect disinterest in politics as elections become less consequential. Public opinion polls on these topics are also a thing of the past, for the same reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of this trajectory, there has been an exodus of Western expatriates and their families from Hong Kong. In a keynote address at CSIS in January 2023, U.S. consul general May estimated that 15,000 U.S. citizens — representing 20 percent of the American population in the city — had left Hong Kong over the past two years, for reasons that included Covid-19 lockdowns but also Beijing’s ongoing crackdowns on democratic freedoms and those who advocate for them. Those who remain do so for distinctive personal and professional reasons that set them apart from many of their colleagues. Very few Westerners are moving to Hong Kong. For the population overall, at least a third of Hong Kong residents suggested interest in emigrating overseas in late 2023. At the same time, the number of mainland Chinese moving to Hong Kong has grown. One consequence is that Mandarin is now far more common than in years past, and Cantonese is far less commonly heard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Washington adjusted its approach to Hong Kong in light of the events of 2019–2020. Congress passed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 (HKHRDA) before the NSL, in response to the proposed extradition bill and ensuing pro-democracy protests. The effort was intended to signal U.S. support for human rights and democracy and to pressure Hong Kong authorities to shelve the bill — requiring, among other measures, the secretary of state to certify annually whether Hong Kong remains sufficiently autonomous to justify special treatment under U.S. law (and authorizing the president to revoke privileges if not). Soon after the NSL was passed, Congress passed the Hong Kong Autonomy Act (HKAA) to sanction officials and entities contributing to the erosion of Hong Kong’s autonomy. Through executive action following the HKAA, the Trump administration sanctioned individuals involved with the NSL and decertified Hong Kong’s special status under U.S. law, pursuing several measures to remove policy exemptions for Hong Kong relative to the PRC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. policy toward Hong Kong remains rooted in a determination to support the SAR’s autonomy, prosperity, and way of life; to protect American individuals and firms in Hong Kong; and to promote the human rights and democratic freedoms of Hong Kong residents. Even as international attention to Hong Kong has declined, the city’s status continues to evolve. The most prominent recent development is the passage of Hong Kong’s own national security legislation, under Article 23 of the Basic Law (the repeat of an effort stopped by public protest in 2003). In past years, Beijing has also continued to flesh out its security apparatus to reflect heightened vigilance around perceived domestic and external threats — broadening the definition of “state secrets” and espionage, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given these dynamics, it is an appropriate time for Washington to revisit its approach to Hong Kong. This report identifies three alternative approaches for U.S. policymakers to consider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Penalization.&lt;/strong&gt; One option is a “penal” approach, rooted in punishing Beijing for its encroachments on Hong Kong’s autonomy. This strategy arguably most closely mirrors the U.S. approach over the past few years. Washington has sanctioned PRC officials and those Beijing has appointed to positions of authority in Hong Kong, including SAR chief executive John Lee. Such sanctions are aimed at raising the costs to Beijing for its behavior. Some argue Washington has further to go, for example shutting down or limiting privileges of Hong Kong Economic and Trade Offices (HKETOs) in the United States or imposing new sanctions on individuals involved in Article 23 formulation. One risk of this penalization strategy is that it could further erode Hong Kong’s economy, by, for example, pushing sanctioned Hong Kong officials closer to Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resignation.&lt;/strong&gt; Another alternative, what might be called “resignation,” would be based on the fact, as detailed in this report, that Hong Kong’s autonomy is on a trajectory of erosion that is likely to continue as long as Xi Jinping leads the CCP. Observers will likely see greater explicit presence of the CCP in Hong Kong, less meaningful elections, narrower space for civil society, more restrictions on information and the media, intensified promotion of “patriotic” education, continued undermining of academic freedom at universities, and a greater use of industrial policy and state tools for economic policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given these trends, the United States could accept and adapt to this reality by removing, step by step, all the policy exemptions that give Hong Kong distinct treatment from China under U.S. law and instead interact with the SAR as just another city in the PRC. There is already evidence of this approach. In line with the Trump administration’s decertification of the SAR’s special status under U.S. law in 2020, U.S. Customs and Border Protection required all goods imported from Hong Kong to use the label “Made in China,” rather than “Made in Hong Kong,” for example (which the WTO later ruled a violation of international trade rules). This broader strategy would translate into wholesale changes in bilateral relations across trade, investment, travel, law enforcement, and other areas. Under this approach, the United States would also oppose Hong Kong’s participation in international organizations, including the WTO, International Monetary Fund, International Olympic Committee, and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The upside of this strategy is that it conforms to the SAR’s most likely trajectory and accepts that Washington and partners are powerless to change that larger trend. Underlying historic U.S. Hong Kong policy was an assumption that China had committed to maintain the SAR’s autonomy until 2047 in ways that justified having a separate relationship with Hong Kong. A resignation strategy acknowledges that the transition period to full takeover by Beijing is over prematurely, and that the facets of political life, the economy, and civil society that made Hong Kong unique are disappearing and unlikely to return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downside of this strategy is that it risks accelerating Hong Kong’s loss of autonomy in every dimension. Beijing will likely conclude it has no choice (or even see this as an opportunity) but to install the CCP more rapidly and make other changes to Hong Kong’s political economy (including eliminating the Hong Kong dollar, for example). While it is right to blame Beijing for Hong Kong’s eroded autonomy thus far, it is worth asking whether pushing the city closer into Beijing’s orbit is in Washington’s strategic interests. In the authors’ view, this is a “feel good” strategy that is unlikely to bring substantial benefits for the United States. Criticizing foreign judges for serving in Hong Kong, for example, may inadvertently reduce safeguards against erosion of judicial independence. Even if this strategy weakens Hong Kong, the SAR’s overall economic heft is small enough on a relative perspective that it will be unlikely to hurt Beijing much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic Engagement.&lt;/strong&gt; The other alternative is to pursue strategic engagement with Hong Kong, across as many domains as possible and for as long as possible, in order to extend the SAR’s distinctiveness, if not pockets of autonomy, within the PRC for as long as possible. The existence of a Hong Kong that runs according to somewhat different rules than the rest of China is a model for other parts of China to see, a place within China with access to a variety of ideas and information and where there are greater legal protections for international business. The U.S. goal here would be to help Hong Kong remain a modest island of openness in relative terms within an authoritarian socialist country. This approach, even while creating immigration and asylum pathways for Hong Kong residents wishing to leave, recognizes that the vast majority will stay in the city — and it is important to support their freedoms. It also recognizes the value that people from all sides in Hong Kong place on a strong and unique relationship with the United States. Furthermore, the strategic engagement approach should not shy away from punitive measures where appropriate, as well as public criticism of further backsliding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this perspective, while sanctions and other punitive measures must remain on the table, the most appropriate U.S. strategy would be to focus on strengthening practical interactions between the United States and Hong Kong. This could include government-to-government communication and dialogue, but it would most certainly involve expanding societal level connections. It would be important to bring a wide range of voices from Hong Kong to the table, both those with pro-government positions and those who are much more critical of the current trajectory — including those forced, for at least the moment, to reside outside the SAR. Track-1 and Track-2 dialogues between U.S. and Hong Kong officials, businesses, universities, think tanks, the media, civil society organizations, and others would go a long way toward reducing misunderstandings on policies and their motivations. Reinstating Fulbright exchanges to and from Hong Kong would be a valuable part of this approach. The overall goal is to slow, where possible, Hong Kong’s slide away from autonomy by reinforcing the connective tissue between the United States and all key actors in Hong Kong, government officials and pro-democracy activists alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deciding how to choose from among these three options is far from easy, as it requires a sense not only of Hong Kong’s trajectory but also of what would be most effective in the long run, not simply in reaction to any specific development or crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with China policy more generally over the past five decades, Washington adopted an engagement policy toward Hong Kong for many years. However, whereas the approach toward China as a whole was geared toward trying to coax reform within China and integrate it into the international system, engagement with Hong Kong was driven not by a goal to change the city, but rather to use the United States’ limited leverage to preserve the city’s economic and social openness for as long as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hong Kong of 2024 looks substantially different than that of 2020, let alone 1997, when the city reverted to PRC sovereignty. The SAR’s autonomy has been substantially eroded by Beijing’s tightening grip. An increasingly closed-off, security-focused Xi administration looks unlikely to reverse course — for Hong Kong or for the country as a whole. This trajectory has resulted in a wave of U.S. sanctions aligned with the penal approach, geared to punishing Beijing and its local allies for reversing course on One Country, Two Systems. The “resignation” approach would extend this logic further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The view of this report’s authors is that a policy built entirely around punishments or giving up on Hong Kong would be counterproductive and result in the further undermining of whatever autonomy remains. As this report has shown, spots of resilience persist, and the best policy approach to managing the challenge of Hong Kong will be rooted in a strong understanding of how its citizens, government authorities, businesses, and civil society organizations envision their city’s future. There remains substantial debate within the city (and among its residents who have moved abroad) about whether developments of the past years have been positive or negative for Hong Kong and how the rest of the world, including the United States, should respond. Although there may be a need for sanctions in certain instances, symbolic opprobrium need not be the central tenet of U.S. policy. Washington would be wise to focus on sustaining what space remains for civic engagement, foreign interaction, and political debate. Such an approach will require patience and persistence, but it lies firmly within U.S. interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, an international coalition of Ukraine’s allies deployed a wide range of sanctions as a core pillar of its response. These sanctions regimes have focused on efforts to restrict the funding and resourcing of the Russian military. However, President Vladimir Putin’s kleptocratic government also relies on an inner circle, which has been rewarded for its loyalty with tremendous wealth. These individuals have also been targeted by sanctions, with bank accounts and trophy assets, such as yachts, being frozen. In anticipation of being sanctioned – or subsequent to designation – these individuals have sought out professional services to construct complex mechanisms for hiding their assets and avoiding the full impact of the sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A critical element of the response to this evasion activity is the work of investigative journalists, including those of the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), which has uncovered information – such as that revealed in the “Rotenberg Files” and “Cyprus Confidential” project – about how these entities and individuals respond, and about the circumvention services they employ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While policymakers have been focused on designing and issuing sanctions packages, historically less focus has been placed on tackling evasion activity, particularly in Europe. Analysing the reporting by OCCRP and others can provide insights into the tactics employed by those seeking to evade sanctions and thus can offer valuable guidance on how to respond in the Russia context and beyond. As this Policy Brief reveals, one critical response to the widespread problem of sanctions circumvention is to disable the professional “enablers” of such circumvention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brief analyses a sample of over 100 relevant recent investigative reports, by OCCRP and other media outlets, on Russian and Belarusian individuals and entities who have been aided by professional service providers in their attempts to circumvent sanctions; as well as official US, UK and EU actions taken against professional enablers and their services since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Using this evidence base, and with an audience of policymakers in mind, this brief identifies common mechanisms by which professional service providers facilitate sanctions evasion and makes recommendations as to how policymakers can work together to minimise the use of professional service providers to circumvent sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-enablers&quot;&gt;The Enablers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Russia’s war in Ukraine entering its third year, and with no military resolution appearing imminent, sanctions – and their effective implementation – will remain a key part of the response to this illegal and unprovoked aggression. At the same time, those targeted by sanctions will inevitably attempt to thwart their impact by exploiting loopholes. Targeting the enablers of this evasion activity will be a critical front in ensuring sanctions are as effective as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “enablers” are professionals who often hide behind a veil of white-collar respectability while providing their clients with services to help them hide, move and invest illicit wealth. These services are frequently provided by lawyers, trust and company formation agents, investment advisers, money managers, real-estate professionals, art and antiquities dealers, and accountants. They can also, as described below, be “one-stop-shop” consultants. The involvement of these enablers falls across a spectrum: at one end sits wilful blindness (for example, choosing not to identify the ultimate beneficiary of opaque financial transactions); and at the other are those that offer active collusion (deliberately hiding and moving assets for Russian oligarchs) by exploiting jurisdictions with lax regulatory oversight and using networks of agents across offshore financial centres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it would be a mistake to focus too much on the type of profession because, as this Policy Brief demonstrates, in practice many enablers from different professional backgrounds perform the same types of services for their clients, such as shell company formation, to take one example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enablers also vary in their level of sophistication. For instance, certain service providers in what is often called the “wealth defence industry” not only create the front-end financial vehicles and offer the asset and legal services necessary to obscure their client’s wealth, but also provide the critical back-end services to contest and attack regulators and the media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the primary focus of this brief is non-bank enablers, which have in the past escaped the kind of regulatory oversight and enforcement that traditional financial institutions have been subjected to, it is critical to acknowledge that banks and elite lenders continue to manage money for clients who are at risk of being sanctioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-services&quot;&gt;The Services&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of the wide range of services provided by the enablers identified through OCCRP and other investigative reporting, as well as the relevant literature, this Policy Brief interprets the term broadly and has identified the following typologies of activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;hiding-wealth&quot;&gt;Hiding Wealth&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Playing the shell game:&lt;/strong&gt; Oligarch ownership is obscured through convoluted corporate structuring that uses shell companies, trusts, nominee directors and the shifting of assets to offshore jurisdictions, including via cryptocurrencies, loan forgiveness schemes, convertible promissory notes and the use of opaque investment vehicles. One example of this behaviour was exposed by the recent Cyprus Confidential investigation, which revealed that Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich held an estimated $2 billion in assets and cash across Credit Suisse, UBS and Barclays. Abramovich’s ownership of blue-chip US stocks, which were used as collateral for bank loans, had been obscured via offshore companies, trusts and complex corporate structures arranged by the Cypriot corporate service provider, MeritServus. In another example from June 2022, the US Treasury Department blocked a Delaware trust holding over $1 billion in assets linked to oligarch Suleiman Kerimov. Although the trust was formed in 2017 and Kerimov was sanctioned in 2018, it took four years for the trust to be identified as blocked. According to the US Treasury’s press release, “Kerimov used a complex series of legal structures and front persons to obscure his interest in [the trust]”. The trust funds were in turn invested in large US companies and “managed by a series of U.S. investment firms and facilitators”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keeping it in the family:&lt;/strong&gt; To avoid detection, enablers often register companies, assets and trusts in the names of relatives or trusted proxies of their clients, as well as using relatives or associates as directors. Investigative reporting has revealed this to be a common typology, with examples including: Russian oligarch Alisher Usmanov’s sister, a gynaecologist, listed as the beneficial owner of 27 Swiss bank accounts; Boris Rotenberg’s bodyguard and Arkady Rotenberg’s girlfriend holding valuable assets; and Alexander Mashenski restructuring ownership of his Belarusian fishing business to benefit his daughter, two months after the invasion of Ukraine. Another high-profile proxy that was exposed through investigative journalism is Eric Whyte, a Canadian and Cypriot citizen, who appears to have no business activities outside the network of offshore companies he allegedly controls – offshore companies connected to assets worth approximately $130 million. OCCRP reporting suggests that the beneficial owner of Whyte’s empire is actually Andrei Kostin, a sanctioned Russian banker with strong ties to Putin.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leveraging networks:&lt;/strong&gt; Enablers employ connections to other money-laundering networks or organised crime. Although they attempt to maintain a veneer of respectability, some enablers are not above working with professional money launderers and criminals. In a sweeping action against sanctions evasion, the US Treasury Department sanctioned Georgios Georgiou for his role in laundering money for “criminal organizations, corrupt businessmen and Russian oligarchs” by using a variety of creative schemes to obscure the beneficial ownership of funds. In its press release, the Treasury noted Georgiou’s provision of services to another sanctioned enabler and founder of a “private equity and corporate structuring entity heavily involved in moving Russian finance into the UAE and money laundering”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;maintaining-control&quot;&gt;Maintaining Control&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pass the parcel of assets:&lt;/strong&gt; Once the source of funds is obscured through shell companies, trusts and investment vehicles, they are invested by the professional enabler (either the same enabler who created the vehicle or a more specialised facilitator such as a real-estate professional). The funds are channelled into desirable assets including shares, real estate, artwork, yachts, jets and other luxury goods, such as precious metals and stones. OCCRP’s investigation into the Russian oligarch brothers Boris and Arkady Rotenberg, “The Rotenberg Files”, has revealed complex investment vehicles, corporate restructures, asset transfers and property schemes involving numerous proxies and permissive jurisdictions, such as the British Virgin Islands and Cyprus, all coordinated by a network of international professional service providers and designed to preserve the brothers’ financial empire and maintain their control over real estate, yachts and companies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Owning 49%:&lt;/strong&gt; Diluting ownership stakes to avoid certain thresholds, such as those that trigger share reporting or financial sanctions, allows the effective control of assets by oligarchs to remain undetected or outside the requirement to freeze those assets. This tactic is often used by enablers in combination with other sanctions-evasion typologies, such as “keeping it in the family”, “pass the parcel of assets”, or “playing the shell game”, to maintain hidden ownership or control. For example, OCCRP investigative reporting in 2022 revealed how, at that time, Usmanov maintained a 49% stake in his main business conglomerate, while the remainder was held by a range of opaque offshore companies and business associates.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;thinking-globally&quot;&gt;Thinking Globally&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shopping around:&lt;/strong&gt; Jurisdiction shopping to take advantage of a lack of sanctions, a delay in sanctions or lax regulatory oversight is one of the most common tactics used by enablers to avoid these measures. OCCRP’s “Russian Asset Tracker” reveals a profusion of oligarch mansions, yachts and planes located in offshore financial centres, such as Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Cyprus, Dubai, Luxembourg, Switzerland, the British Virgin Islands and the Isle of Man. Moreover, recent investigative reporting into large leaks of financial documents, such as the FinCEN files, Panama Papers and Suisse Secrets reports, all bear the classic hallmark of oligarchs using offshore entities to hide their international assets. The Rotenberg Files further reveal how mismatches between the US, EU and UK sanctions against the brothers and their family members allowed them to exploit those differences. While both brothers were sanctioned by the US in 2014, the UK and the EU did not sanction both until years later. For cunning and well-resourced oligarchs, that sort of time lag is a major window of opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passport to financial freedom:&lt;/strong&gt; Enablers often take advantage of the multiple passports of their clients and their clients’ family members to unlock access to favourable jurisdictions. Investigative reporting has identified the Finnish citizenship of Boris Rotenberg and the US citizenship of his wife. Abramovich is a citizen of Israel and Portugal, in addition to Russia. Members of the powerful Vorobyev family are citizens of Israel, Latvia, Singapore and Monaco. If their clients do not already possess useful passports, enablers also facilitate the purchase of citizenship in a preferred jurisdiction. As OCCRP reported in February 2023, five of the 10 people sanctioned by the US for operating a Russian arms sanctions-evasion network acquired EU citizenship through Cyprus’s notorious “golden passport” scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;deflecting-scrutiny&quot;&gt;Deflecting Scrutiny&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the front foot:&lt;/strong&gt; Many enablers offer a one-stop shop, not only constructing the vehicles necessary to shield their clients’ assets from international scrutiny; but also negotiating or aggressively dealing with regulators, compliance officials and journalists who take an interest in their clients’ affairs. An OCCRP report into data leaked from the boutique Swiss investment firm Finaport Holding shows a client list that included dozens of politically exposed persons, among them Russian oligarchs. Correspondence published by OCCRP demonstrates how Finaport employees actively circumvented compliance procedures and forcefully pushed back against due diligence requests from banks, dismissing concerns and threatening to remove their clients’ accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spin and suits:&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to playing defence, some enablers play offence by deploying global public relations strategies and international lawfare against governments, regulators and the media. For instance, in October 2022 The Intercept reported that Yevgeny Prigozhin, then-leader of the mercenary Wagner Group, had recruited UK and US legal firms to challenge international sanctions against him and to sue journalists who had investigated his business dealings. The detrimental impact of such strategic lawsuits against public participation (SLAPPs) is immense, with OCCRP revealing in 2023 that journalists and media outlets in its global network were battling over 60 lawsuits filed by the subjects of their investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;being-prepared&quot;&gt;Being Prepared&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Staying one step ahead:&lt;/strong&gt; With all risk-management strategies, the best outcome is to avoid exposure entirely. Thus, the most accomplished professional service providers engage in all typologies of sanctions-avoidance activity before their client is even sanctioned. For example, OCCRP and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists investigative reporting has revealed that, in the days after the invasion of Ukraine, PwC Cyprus facilitated the transfer of millions of dollars between anonymous shell companies on behalf of as yet non-sanctioned Russian oligarch clients. Similarly, shortly before sanctions were imposed on Roman Abramovich, leaked files demonstrate that trusts holding billions of dollars in assets were amended to transfer beneficial ownership to his seven children.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Conclusion and Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As illustrated by the reporting and analysis presented in this brief, fundamental policy and practice gaps continue to allow enablers to help their clients improperly protect their assets and interests from sanctions. To address the range of activities highlighted above, policymakers should take the following steps, which will also strengthen sanctions implementation beyond the Russia context:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish deterrence:&lt;/strong&gt; Enforcement actions against professional enabler networks that violate existing laws and designations against those that operate in lax jurisdictions must be increased. The EU and the UK lag the US when it comes to designations of, and criminal and civil enforcement against, professional enablers. The chilling effect of US and UK designations against Cypriot enablers in April 2023 should be replicated, while more criminal prosecutions should be brought against those who continue to break the law, following the example of the US Department of Justice’s Task Force KleptoCapture, and greater use should be made of the multinational REPO Taskforce. Currently, being a professional enabler in the UK and the EU is low cost and high reward, with few to no consequences. This is critical as professional enablers serve as nodes for sanctions evasion and can cater to multiple sanctioned clients.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhance coordination:&lt;/strong&gt; Better coordination of sanctions designations across likeminded jurisdictions is required to improve compliance. Although significant strides have been made in multilateral coordination between the US, the UK and the EU, and other likeminded jurisdictions, significant differences in sanctions designations remain, as shown by the Atlantic Council’s Russia Sanctions Database. At the same time, this brief demonstrates that jurisdictional arbitrage is one of the most popular methods for avoiding the bite of sanctions, and that lags in the imposition of sanctions provide legal cover to enablers taking advantage of differences in timing to move and hide oligarch assets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take a “network” approach:&lt;/strong&gt; Sanctions must be imposed on an oligarch’s entire network simultaneously to minimise opportunities to shift assets to family members and associates. Any delay facilitates evasion. The use of family members, such as children, romantic partners, and even low-level associates, like bodyguards or school friends, continues to be a top sanctions-evasion and -avoidance method. Abramovich’s transfers to his children are a case in point. While it is standard in US sanctions programmes to include spouses and adult children, the EU only expanded its sanctions programme to cover immediate family members in mid-2023. But loopholes – such as the use of minors who are unlikely to be sanctioned for legal and policy reasons – persist and should be addressed by, for example, blocking assets that have been transferred to them in an apparent effort to avoid sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Publicise blocked property:&lt;/strong&gt; A lack of information about ownership impedes effective private sector implementation. To enhance private sector enforcement, allies should consistently and publicly identify any property, such as real estate, yachts and artwork, or legal arrangements, such as trusts, in which the sanctioned person has an interest. As described above, particular attention should be paid to any assets that may have been transferred to family members and associates to shield them from sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harmonise ownership and control sanctions rules:&lt;/strong&gt; Harmonisation of the sanctions rules on 50% ownership and control across the US, the UK and the EU is required to enhance multilateral sanctions enforcement. Additionally, the US should expand its “50% rule” to encompass a control standard as lowering ownership of entities to just below the 50% threshold while maintaining control through proxies continues to be a favoured tactic used by oligarchs and their enablers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Close regulatory loopholes:&lt;/strong&gt; Loopholes in the regulation and supervision of professional enablers facilitate sanctions circumvention and evasion. The US, in particular, needs to pass legislation or in certain cases finalise proposed rules imposing anti-money-laundering obligations on those who provide certain financial or related services, including those who incorporate or register companies, form trusts, manage money or other assets, are involved in real-estate closings and settlements, advise on investments, or are engaged in the trade or sale of works of art or antiquities. Those who fail to comply should face more actively applied civil and/or criminal penalties and, as appropriate, the suspension or revocation of licences, along with other disciplinary actions. The UK and the EU should focus on making their existing supervisory regimes more effective and on following through with enforcement to act as a genuine deterrent.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on services:&lt;/strong&gt; As enablers do not adhere to neatly defined professional roles, neither should efforts to regulate them. To avoid inadvertently creating loopholes, legislation and regulations should follow the example of the proposed US ENABLERS Act by focusing on the services provided by enablers across various professions, such as setting up companies and trusts, serving as nominee directors and managing assets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pressure enabling jurisdictions:&lt;/strong&gt; The ability of certain jurisdictions to continue to offer sanctions-evasion services must be addressed. Pressure on enabler jurisdictions, such as Cyprus, the British Virgin Islands, the UAE and Türkiye must be increased to restrict evasion opportunities by designing clearer consequences for their actions. If such efforts are unsuccessful, allies must issue advisories on specific “enabler jurisdictions”, laying out the risks of doing business with them and should consider creating a designation category of “jurisdiction of primary sanctions evasion concern”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhance scrutiny of visa and citizenship schemes:&lt;/strong&gt; Further progress must be made in addressing the abuse of “golden passports/visas” (or citizenship/residency) by investment schemes which are easily exploited by oligarchs and their enablers to shield themselves and their assets. Numerous oligarchs and enablers are reported to have benefited from these types of schemes. More broadly, visa bans should be used more frequently – and the listings publicised and coordinated between allies – to enhance travel restrictions on those who, whether or not in violation of local law, enable sanctions evasion and to highlight those enablers who represent a sanctions-evasion risk.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop more inclusive information sharing mechanisms:&lt;/strong&gt; Investigative journalists and civil society have committed significant resources to revealing sanctions-evasion vulnerabilities and activities. Governments should systematically leverage this capacity by sharing unclassified information with accredited journalism organisations, civil society and the private sector to enhance investigations and compliance. They should also expand or create dedicated liaison and reporting channels for two-way information exchange that shield groups submitting information from legal or other threats.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get serious about tackling SLAPP suits:&lt;/strong&gt; The UK and the EU need to build on recent progress by ensuring that the UK’s anti-SLAPP bill is sufficiently broad and the EU’s anti-SLAPP directive is implemented properly by member states. Effective anti-SLAPP laws are essential to ensuring that the “wealth defence industry” is not able to suppress investigative reporting by journalists and civil society that exposes kleptocrats and their enablers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continue to boost beneficial ownership and control transparency:&lt;/strong&gt; Publicly accessible, central and verified beneficial ownership registries that encompass the full gamut of legal entities and arrangements are indispensable to combating sanctions evasion. Key global centres, such as the British Virgin Islands, must be provided with the analytical resources they need, and journalists and civil society actors must be granted access to such registries to allow them to leverage the information in their investigations, thus serving as a resource for overextended governments. Governments too must upskill law enforcement and other investigative authorities on how to make use of beneficial ownership information.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine grinds into its third year and the range of sanctions targets dwindles, curtailing evasion activities must be a heightened focus for Ukraine’s allies. As this Policy Brief has shown, central to this mission should be an active campaign to disable the enablers which have been revealed by investigative journalists to be, knowingly or unknowingly, facilitating evasion by exploiting loopholes and using a range of obfuscation tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;被捕後落假口供 數月後決定協助警方調查道出實情 陳梓華：唔想受到良心嘅責難&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（6日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第70日審訊。陳梓華繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。陳早前承認在2020年10月首次被捕之後，在錄影會面中向警察提供虛假陳述，為了與黎智英、李宇軒和「重光團隊」等撇清關係；直至2021年3月底，陳決定做控方證人，並向警方道出實情。被問到為何改變主意，陳表示：「因為我一開始畀嘅口供唔係事實，後來我希望將個事實講返出來」，他之後又說：「因為我唔想再受到責難。」控方追問受到誰人責難，陳稱：「我唔想受到良心嘅責難。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已認罪的被告陳梓華第12天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。代表黎智英的紐西蘭御用大律師 Marc Corlett 早前完成盤問，現由控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行覆問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華想與攬炒巴等人撇清關係-因為知道大家犯法&quot;&gt;陳梓華：想與攬炒巴等人撇清關係 因為知道大家犯法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，陳梓華在2020年10月10日首次被捕，之後在警署進行了兩次錄影會面，陳在早前承認在該些錄影會面中向警察提供虛假陳述，並解釋稱因為當時以為可以與黎智英、其私人助手 Mark Simon、李宇軒、「攬炒巴」劉祖廸和「重光團隊」撇清關係。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到為何想撇清關係，陳回答：「因為當時我知道其實大家都有犯到法」，因「重光團隊」繼續推動制裁，他知道 Mark Simon 和劉祖廸仍然有參與，而他自己也是美國線一員，所以他認為大家已經觸犯了《國安法》。而當時李宇軒已經被捕，陳相信警方很大機會已經查到他與李宇軒等人的關係。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱起初說謊後來說真話-因唔想受到良心嘅責難&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱起初說謊後來說真話 因「唔想受到良心嘅責難」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，直至2021年3至4月，陳梓華同意協助警方調查，並於4月28日首次以控方證人身份進行錄影會面。控方問陳，在該次錄影會面，以及其後的所有錄影會面中，有否向警方講真話。陳表示有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，在決定做控方證人之前，陳向警方提供虛假陳述，可是他決定做控方證人之後，似乎有一個想法上的轉變，問陳為何後來決定向警方如實交代實情。陳表示：「因為我一開始畀嘅口供唔係事實，後來我希望將個事實講返出來」，他之後又說：「因為我唔想再受到責難。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問陳梓華不想受到誰人責難。陳表示：「我唔想受到良心嘅責難。」所以在後來一次錄影會面中，他提出要求做控方證人，「因為嗰時3月尾已經想將所有嘅真相都講出嚟。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華被捕前已丟棄手機-故錄口供時警方沒有出示通訊對話憑記憶作供&quot;&gt;陳梓華：被捕前已丟棄手機 故錄口供時警方沒有出示通訊對話、憑記憶作供&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示陳的書面證供，他提及黎說過不論是宣揚港獨還是主張維持一國兩制，總之要百花齊放，在香港本土保持熱度。陳梓華指，這裡的「熱度」是指抗爭的熱度，整體上是反政府和爭取「五大訴求」的立場。他稱這部份證供與其早前庭上指黎說過不是不支持勇武是有關係，因為黎智英認為勇武派是保持抗爭熱度的其中一個原因。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方在早前盤問中質疑，就2020年1月台北陽明山別墅的會議，陳未曾在任何錄影會面或書面供詞中提及過，他自己向黎智英指「攬炒巴」劉祖廸曾去過美國，以及其團隊在德國和愛丁堡舉辦過遊行。而陳亦確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在控方覆問下，陳解釋錄取口供的時候，他只記起黎智英和劉祖廸之間的對話內容，而開場白和自我介紹則沒有記起到，所以便沒有向警察提起。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又提到，在他被捕之前，他已經丟掉了他的手機，所以他被捕之後，載有訊息的手機並沒有被警方檢取，其後進行的錄影會面中，警察並沒有向他出示任何訊息紀錄，因此當時全部憑記憶錄口供，而他與李宇軒和黎智英之間的 Signal 訊息紀錄，也是他上庭作供時才第一次見到。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指黎智英籲他把訊息同身邊嘅人講-意思是告訴ipac和swhk&quot;&gt;陳梓華指黎智英籲他把訊息「同身邊嘅人講」 意思是告訴IPAC和SWHK&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳早前供稱，2020年6月赴壹傳媒大樓與黎智英會面期間，陳稱他向黎表達對國安法的關注，認為需要「褪」，即所有人都不應該繼續倡議制裁，黎則籲陳叫其他人繼續在文宣和國際線上工作。辯方質疑上述說話從沒出現在陳的錄影會面或書面供詞中，亦指陳從沒有在該次會面中向黎談論 IPAC 和 SWHK。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今展示陳的供詞紀錄，他曾向警察引述黎的說話：「你應該同身邊嘅人講呢⋯⋯係 pass on 個 message 畀身邊嘅年青人，叫佢哋勇於去繼續發言、繼續發聲⋯⋯啲國際游說嘅工作，咁呀繼續去做，唔好停咁樣樣。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳回應，當時黎智英叫他繼續做國際游說的時候，黎是想他將這個訊息告知 SWHK 成員；而黎說「你應該同身邊嘅人講」，是因為李宇軒有協助 IPAC，而且 SWHK 當時剛剛加入 IPAC，所以黎想陳向 IPAC 和 SWHK 傳遞訊息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示另一份供詞，陳當時向警察引述黎稱：「而且他會以身作則繼續於各大媒體呼籲關注及制裁中國及香港，並要求我繼續呼籲各界進行文宣、國際游說及參加初選等。」陳解釋，上文提到的「國際游說」是指 SWHK。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華自稱傳聲筒-如團隊遇難題會轉達給mark-simon&quot;&gt;陳梓華自稱「傳聲筒」 如團隊遇難題會轉達給Mark Simon&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方亦質疑，陳從沒有在錄口供時提及他與美國線有紛爭，要求黎的私人助手 Mark Simon 出面調停，其後 Mark Simon 出手擺平爭拗，往後與美國線保持聯繫。就此，控方展示陳的口供紀錄，當中陳稱：「好多時例如眾籌嘅時候，佢哋有啲信息呀，或者有啲時候遇到難題咁，可能要搵到阿 Mark 或者係搵到黎智英嘅時候呢，咁我就係一個傳聲筒咁樣樣嘅，就會幫佢哋將個 request ，即係佢哋嘅訴求話到畀阿 Mark 知。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳確認上述證供，並舉例指有一次黎智英說「要有啲耐性」，因為當時日本線接觸不到「枱底人」，於是陳告訴李宇軒：「黎智英話要有啲耐性，同埋或者可以搵阿 Mark 幫手。」此外，陳稱黎說過：「IPAC 好重要」，而他亦有跟李宇軒轉達黎的說話，叫李應該留在 IPAC 及繼續國際游說。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華早前庭上供稱他曾告知 Mark Simon，李宇軒頑固地不想離開香港，惟辯方質疑此對話從沒出現在其供詞紀錄中。在控方覆問下，陳指警方錄取口供時，從沒有問及他與 Mark Simon 之間有關李宇軒的對話內容，也沒有向他展示他與李宇軒之間的 Signal 訊息對話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方亦質疑陳從未向 Mark Simon 提及 IPAC，僅在庭上首度提及。控方問陳，為何錄取口供時沒有向警察提及相關對話。陳則指沒有特別原因，「只係因為我冇具體參與喺 IPAC 入面，所以我印象唔係好深刻。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華黎智英想組大台橫跨勇武和理非-相當於主導整個社運&quot;&gt;陳梓華：黎智英想組「大台」橫跨勇武和理非 相當於主導整個社運&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方盤問時指出，黎智英從沒說過想做勇武派的領袖，也不是想做勇武派一員，去破壞公物或縱火。在控方覆問下，陳表示：「我諗佢（黎）唔係話想成為勇武隊嘅領袖，佢係想組織一個橫跨和理非同埋勇武嘅大台，而呢個大台係佢可以主導嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又指，當時勇武派沒有「大台」，只有零零星星比較出名的勇武小隊，所以一旦不同勇武小隊的領袖，以及和理非的領袖，兩者能夠組成「大台」，「咁就相當於主導晒成個社會運動，呢個就係我當時嘅意思。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱對swhk背景和目的沒有存疑-但會跟朋友說負面風評&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱對SWHK背景和目的沒有存疑 但會跟朋友說負面風評&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華於2020年10月的錄影會面謄本顯示，他當時向警察稱：「因為我對於 Stand with Hong Kong 嘅某啲目的，甚或乎背景，我一直有存疑，咁可能我會有所貶抑，對佢哋一啲負面嘅評論，可能會喺私底下同朋友上面，或者係同家人有講過。」在辯方盤問下，陳稱為了想與 SWHK 撇清關係而說謊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在控方的澄清下，陳表示對於 SWHK 的背景和目的並沒有存疑，所以向警方稱「一直有存疑」是謊話；不過「咁可能我會有所貶抑」則是真話，「有啲唔好嘅風評，我係有同朋友講過。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱黎智英起初對攬炒態度負面-區選後不再批評或反對&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱黎智英起初對「攬炒」態度負面 區選後不再批評或反對&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，陳梓華曾被辯方問到，黎智英、李柱銘和 Mark Simon 是否都對「攬炒」抱持負面態度，當時陳回答「最初係」，控方問後來上述人士的立場是如何。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，在2019年區議會選舉之後，黎智英和 Mark Simon 對於「攬炒」的取態有改變，「佢哋（老泛民）唔再批評或者反對攬炒派，尤其是喺國際線上面，佢哋認為攬炒派係可以團結嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱黎智英繼續呼籲制裁-辯方質疑沒看過文章內容&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱黎智英繼續呼籲制裁 辯方質疑沒看過文章內容&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方表示覆問完畢。在法官的提問下，陳稱在《國安法》生效之後，有在網上見到黎智英繼續呼籲制裁，包括推動「避風港法案」，又邀請很多外國智庫和政經界名人來做訪問，以及在社交媒體上繼續發表意見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過在辯方御用大律師 Marc Corlett 的提問下，陳梓華稱不記得自己看過的黎智英文章和直播影片內容，他稱當時在 Telegram 上見到一條連結，相信是通往黎智英的一篇文章，而且相信內容是關於呼籲制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6XjMYdi.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 資深大律師 彭耀鴻（左）、大律師 Marc Corlett（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方質疑，陳梓華之所以說黎智英在《國安法》之後繼續呼籲制裁，是因為他只在 Telegram 上看過一篇或多於一篇的文章標題，可是他並沒有按進去連結來閱讀文章內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此時法官杜麗冰表示留意到時間，辯方表示他要問的問題是很重要的範疇，因此杜官押後至明日再續。控方表示，明天陳梓華完成作供之後，將傳召下一名證人、前壹傳媒財務總裁周達權，惟他並非以「從犯證人」身份作供，而是一名市民證人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/QnjVBYF.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
▲ 左起：張劍虹、黎智英、周達權（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問控方，周達權作供需時多久。控方指一日或一日之內便可完成主問。李官笑言，他有需要問控方這些問題，因為「我還有其他的事要忙（“I am busy with something else.”）」。控方又指，現時控辯雙方正在商討能否以書面方式處理香港城市大學法律學院教授、梁美芬丈夫王貴國的證供，而毋須他出庭作供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方則指，根據陳梓華的證供，有不少警察曾經到懲教所探訪他，因此要求傳召涉事的6至7名警員出庭作供。法官問辯方是否堅持要在庭上播放長達35小時的「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」影片，辯方則指這些影片是重要。辯方表示，本來相信審訊可於5月底完成，但是現在相信還需要6月初的時間。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;庭上認向警作虛假陳述 陳梓華：當時有僥倖心態、以為可與黎智英撇清關係&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/QiBjkBm.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（3日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第69日審訊。陳梓華繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供，並接受辯方盤問。陳連日來在庭上供述他與黎智英和 Mark Simon 之間的對話，惟辯方質疑陳從沒在錄影會面或書面供詞中提及該些對話，並質疑陳在證人台上捏造一些陳述出來，為自己謀取利益。陳否認。此外，陳早前承認在2020年10月首次被捕之後，在錄影會面中向警察提供虛假陳述，包括他並非「重光團隊」成員、經常取笑攬炒派、沒有協助李宇軒逃離香港等等。被問到為何要說謊，陳稱：「當時我仲有一個僥倖嘅心態」，以為可以與黎智英和「重光團孩」等撇清到關係，並且可在獲釋之後得到 Mark Simon 安排離開香港。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指陳梓華部份庭上供述對話-從未在落口供時提及-陳同意&quot;&gt;辯方指陳梓華部份庭上供述對話 從未在落口供時提及 陳同意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華早前作供時引述自己及黎智英等人的說話，包括黎表示他並非不支持勇武，但是要迎合西方的要求，國際的支持比勇武的支持更加重要。辯方質疑上述說話從沒在陳的書面證供或錄影會面中提及過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳則引述其書面證供，當中提及黎說過不論是宣揚港獨還是主張維持一國兩制，總之要百花齊放，在香港本土保持熱度；惟陳最終承認他在這部份的證供中沒提及過黎說「希望你明白我並非不支持勇武」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方逐一指出以下對話並未曾在陳的錄影會面或書面供詞中提及過。陳確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;在台北的陽明山別墅會議中，黎問「攬炒巴」劉祖廸為何眾籌可以達到如此龐大規模，二人繼而分析原因；&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;在台北的陽明山別墅會議中，「攬炒巴」劉祖廸聽畢黎智英的說話後，表示要跟李宇軒商討；&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;陳稱自己曾告訴黎智英，劉祖廸不想打議會線，但會全力打國際線，而且日本線有李宇軒牽頭；&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;陳稱他與美國線有紛爭，要求黎的私人助手 Mark Simon 出面調停，其後 Mark Simon 出手擺平爭拗，往後與美國線保持聯繫；&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;在壹傳媒大樓的會面中，陳稱他向黎表達對《國安法》的關注，認為需要「褪」，即所有人都不應該繼續倡議制裁，黎又問 IPAC 會否使用眾籌的款項，並籲陳叫其他人繼續在文宣和國際線上工作&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;陳稱他曾告知 Mark Simon，李宇軒頑固地不想離開香港&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方引述陳在錄影會面中自稱：「純粹係我好討厭有啲人利用謊言去為佢自己謀取利益」，質疑陳如今在證人台上捏造一些陳述出來，為自己謀取利益，正正是錄影會面中他所批評的同一類人。惟陳不同意，「正正就係因為我討厭（利用謊言來謀取利益的人），所以我想將個事實講出嚟。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方盤問完畢，控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行覆問時指，陳在2020年10月10日被警方以「協助罪犯」罪拘捕，之後於10月10及11日在警署進行了兩次錄影會面，當其時陳尚未決定以證人身份協助調查。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在辯方早前盤問之下，陳承認當時錄影會面中向警方說出虛假陳述，例如他並非「重光團隊」成員、經常取笑攬炒派等。控方則問陳，為何會向警方作出虛假陳述。陳回答：「當時我仲有一個僥倖嘅心態。我以為可以撇清到關係。」控方追問，陳想與什麼撇清關係。陳指是黎智英、其私人助手 Mark Simon、李宇軒、「攬炒巴」劉祖廸和「重光團隊」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又指：「我以為當時畀完口供，或者離開咗警署之後，Mark Simon 可以安排到方法畀我離開香港。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳於2021年2月被正式起訴及還柙，直至2021年3月31日決定以證人身份協助警方調查，之後於4月28日以證人身份進行首次錄影會面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下周一（5月6日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

But what implications does this have for norms on responsible state behaviour and transparency around cyber operations?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-complex-chessboard-for-cyber-capabilities-the-indo-pacific&quot;&gt;A Complex Chessboard for Cyber Capabilities: The Indo-Pacific&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Louise Marie Hurel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comprising approximately 40 economies, the Indo-Pacific is set to represent over 50% of the world’s GDP by 2040, with China, Japan, India, South Korea and Australia’s combined GDPs already totalling more than the whole of the EU put together. Throughout the past years, this vast and diverse region has also become central to strategic engagement by Five Eyes countries on a range of topics. Canada, the UK, the US, Australia and others have published their own strategies for the Indo-Pacific and forged security partnerships such as the trilateral AUKUS initiative, which have also focused on “developing a range of capabilities, to share and increase interoperability between […] armed forces” – with a dedicated a pillar for cyber capabilities, AI, quantum and other emerging technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But beyond economic, defence-focused or external incentives, the Indo-Pacific region forms a chessboard for complex technological disputes over the production of semiconductors in Taiwan, US-China geopolitical clashes concerning the latter’s state-linked cyber operations, thorny concerns around the conflation of cyber security and content control and moderation, as well as increasing cyber threats from both state and non-state actors. At the same time, ASEAN and other cross-regional efforts such as the Quad grouping have also sought to address some of these challenges by focusing on cyber capacity building, critical infrastructure protection and building shared resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, cyberspace has become a reflection of tensions within the region. Earlier this year, a reported leak from a Chinese company showed that the country had been conducting cyber espionage campaigns against multiple governments in the region. This included telecom service providers in Pakistan, Mongolia and Malaysia, as well as various parts of the Indian government. India, meanwhile, has sought to ramp up its own capabilities through the establishment of a National Cyber Agency in 2018, as well as conducting advanced persistent threat (APT) operations. At the same time, Pakistan has not fallen short of developing capacities in this area, with the alleged Pakistan-linked APT36 group targeting organisations in India. Moreover, in Southeast Asia, Vietnam-linked APT32 has targeted human rights defenders within the country as well as organisations in the Philippines and Laos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Indo-Pacific region forms a chessboard for complex technological disputes over the production of semiconductors in Taiwan, US-China geopolitical clashes concerning the latter’s state-linked cyber operations, thorny concerns around the conflation of cyber security and content control and moderation, as well as increasing cyber threats from both state and non-state actors&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While far from being devoid of challenges, countries in the region have nonetheless committed to norms for responsible state behaviour at the UN. The question that remains, however, is how they will attempt (or not) to reconcile the commitment to such norms with the development of cyber capabilities such as the establishment of cyber commands, the use of offensive cyber capabilities, or having a more active posture when it comes to responding to and preventing cyber operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While one might not exclude the other, this does raise the question of how states should be held accountable when they (explicitly or implicitly) seek to enhance their cyber capabilities, be it for domestic or international use. Additionally, some countries in the region – especially those beyond China and North Korea – can often be overlooked in their ongoing development of capacities to act and engage in cyber operations, and this calls for a deeper analysis of other Indo-Pacific economies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this piece, we gather experts from the region to reflect on the often-thorny relationship between state responsibility and the development of capacities to conduct cyber operations, the internal justifications countries have devised to legitimise doing so, and the institutions devised to support such capacities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;indias-strategic-ambiguity-in-cyberspace-and-cyber-operations&quot;&gt;India’s Strategic Ambiguity in Cyberspace and Cyber Operations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arindrajit Basu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India’s security doctrines have always been shrouded in strategic ambiguity. Unsurprisingly, the development and deployment of cyber capabilities has been no exception. While external analysts and former officials have acknowledged the state’s capacity to conduct cyber operations or orchestrate India-backed hacktivist groups against geopolitical adversaries, there has been no overarching pronouncement or “cyber doctrine” guiding these developments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, military doctrines have acknowledged the tactical necessity of integrating cyber capabilities with kinetic warfare, although they have stopped short of articulating clear objectives or normative rules of engagement. Despite the often-challenging task of reading between the lines regarding mandate and legality of operations, India has allegedly used cyber capabilities such as cyber intrusive tools for both domestic and external surveillance. This has been seen in recent reports which have further highlighted India’s use of targeted surveillance capabilities such as the NSO group’s Pegasus spyware against geopolitical adversaries and internal opposition figures, although the government has issued clear denials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;India’s security doctrines have always been shrouded in strategic ambiguity&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even so, India is trying to project itself as a responsible global power, including in cyberspace. This projection comes not from grand proclamations but through subtle diplomacy. For example, unlike several other countries, India is yet to publish a clear statement on how international law applies in cyberspace. However, the country has engaged in concerted cyber diplomacy both bilaterally and through “minilateral” partnerships like the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, the Counter Ransomware Initiative and the G20. In multilateral forums, India has consistently emphasised issues that most closely mirror its geopolitical interests, including cyber terrorism, the protection of critical information infrastructure, and capacity-building. The overarching global objective lies in what I have assessed elsewhere as “ideological agnosticism and selective engagement” – that is, maintaining flexibility on doctrinal questions and evading controversial normative debates while tactically engaging on less controversial issues and working with partners to shore up India’s cyber security posture and existing capabilities. Relatedly, there appears to be limited appetite for a public discussion of its doctrine or capabilities. While India’s present strategy appears to be working as it reaps the dividends of its geopolitical “sweet spot”, its aspirations for global leadership must be underpinned by demonstrable commitments to the UN framework on responsible state behaviour, both in word and deed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-role-of-cyber-capabilities-in-advancing-vietnams-security-and-prosperity&quot;&gt;The Role of Cyber Capabilities in Advancing Vietnam’s Security and Prosperity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bich Tran&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often overlooked in global cyber security debates, Vietnam has made significant efforts to develop capabilities to advance its interests in cyberspace over the past decade. In 2023, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh stressed that ensuring cyber safety and security is an important and long-term task. While motivations might vary, Vietnam has arguably deployed cyber operations to protect the communist regime, defend national sovereignty, and advance its economic interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Communist Party of Vietnam perceives the current cyber landscape as a struggle against what it sees as a “peaceful revolution,” with many dissidents and anti-regime groups using online platforms to further their agendas. Vietnamese officials also regard cyberspace as an important battlefield alongside the air, land, sea and space domains. Cyber attacks from alleged Chinese hackers targeting the country have demonstrated how cyberspace has become a theatre for Vietnam–China territorial disputes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address these issues, Vietnam has established two cyber units. Task Force 47, named after Directive No. 47 issued in 2016 by the General Political Department, consists of over 10,000 members. Its mission is to counter what the Party considers “wrongful views” promoted by “hostile forces”. The second unit is the Cyberspace Operations Command, established in 2017 and announced in 2018 as a combat unit of the Ministry of National Defence. It is responsible for protecting national sovereignty in cyberspace and maintaining cyber security within the military. While Task Force 47 specialises in anti-disinformation, the Cyberspace Operations Command is concerned with comprehensive cyber security, including technical aspects. In essence, Task Force 47 is primarily concerned with regime security, while the Cyberspace Operations Command focuses on safeguarding national sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Communist Party of Vietnam perceives the current cyber landscape as a struggle against what it sees as a “peaceful revolution”, with many dissidents and anti-regime groups using online platforms to further their agendas&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development of cyber capabilities is also essential for Vietnam to reach its goals of becoming an upper middle-income developing country by 2030 and a high-income developed country by 2045. The 2020 National Digital Transformation Programme (NDTP) for the period through 2025, with a vision extending to 2030, set a target for the digital economy to contribute 20% of Vietnam’s GDP by 2025 and 30% by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NDTP also aimed to put the country in the top 40 of the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) by 2025 and the top 30 by 2030. This goal was surpassed as Vietnam’s ranking jumped from 50th out of 175 countries in 2018 to 25th out of 182 countries in 2020. The 2022 National Cybersecurity Strategy aims to ensure that Vietnam’s ranking on the GCI stays between 25th and 30th by 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides its own efforts, Vietnam has leveraged external resources to enhance its capabilities through cyber diplomacy. Bilaterally, it has strengthened cyber security cooperation with its partners, such as India, the EU and Australia. Multilaterally, the country has engaged with the international community on cyber security issues to promote its interests in cyberspace and contribute to the development of international norms and rules governing cyber activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;japans-hesitant-shift-toward-active-cyber-operations&quot;&gt;Japan’s Hesitant Shift Toward Active Cyber Operations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wilhelm Vosse&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Japan began to codify its response to the opportunities and growing threats of cyberspace in its information and later cyber security strategies in 2006, its main objective was to strengthen the rule of law in cyberspace. Japan’s primary instrument has long been international cooperation with like-minded countries in bilateral cyber dialogues, regional organisations such as ASEAN, and global mechanisms such as the UN Group of Governmental Experts and the Open-Ended Working Group. Over the last decade, Japan has become one of the most active players in cyber diplomacy, promoting cyber norms, an international legal framework, and responsible behaviour in cyberspace. Japan has limited itself to an almost exclusively diplomatic and normative response to growing security threats because this reflects its inherent preference for non-militaristic foreign and security policy and its general risk-aversiveness. These factors also explain why Japan has responded to cyber attacks against both public and private entities through a crime-based perspective, viewing them as a concern that needs to be taken care by the police and the judiciary. And even in cases such as the 2021 Cybersecurity Strategy that signalled an intent to extend the country’s response through the development of active cyber defence capabilities (ACD), the details remained vague.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 led to a fundamental rethinking of Japan’s security policy. The latest National Security Strategy, issued in December 2022, states for the first time that Japan will introduce an active cyber defence capability, which will include the penetration and neutralisation of the servers of potential attackers. Such language should not be overlooked: it represents a significant leap from Japan’s traditional preference for more passive and risk-averse tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 led to a fundamental rethinking of Japan’s security policy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But beyond words, the government has also committed to further investments in this area. Funding and personnel for the Ministry of Defense’s Cyber Defence Command to prepare and conduct such cyber operations are planned to be significantly increased until 2027. Still, this remains an ambitious plan. The commitment to develop ACD has triggered questions in parliament about what active cyber defence operations really entail and whether the government is willing to accept potential counterattacks. This debate is still ongoing, but it can be assumed that active measures will only be deployed after other diplomatic measures have been exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the risk of potentially triggering dangerous responses from countries like China or North Korea, Japan needs to fundamentally strengthen the security of its domestic critical information infrastructure before embarking on this route. Going from planning to operationalisation might be a bigger challenge than expected, as it is already struggling to find qualified personnel and still needs to revise privacy and other laws to make such operations legal in Japan. To what extent Japan is willing to take the risks of active or offensive cyber operations remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;australias-evolving-perspective-on-cyber-operations&quot;&gt;Australia’s Evolving Perspective on Cyber Operations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mike Bareja&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2016, the Australian government confirmed its offensive cyber capability, making Australia one of the few countries to make such activity publicly known. The Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) leads Australia’s offensive cyber capabilities, probably sharing capabilities with the Australian Defence Force’s Cyber Warfare Division. This capability is growing. Announced in 2022, an A$10 billion budget increase over 10 years for project REDSPICE will triple Australia’s offensive cyber capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australian cyber operations align with international norms such as those set by the UN framework of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace. They also comply with Australian and international law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ASD’s primary legislation is the Intelligence Services Act 2001, which sets out its purpose (functions) and the authorisations it must obtain for this activity. The legislation also says that the agency must abide by the law and only act in the performance of its functions. Otherwise, an employee is liable to face civil and criminal legal action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Australian cyber operations align with international norms such as those set by the UN framework of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All Australian intelligence agencies have robust oversight, including through Parliamentary committees. The Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security (IGIS) also scrutinises ASD’s intelligence activities for legality and propriety. The IGIS works to ensure that each activity is legal, reasonable and proportional, and publishes an unclassified, publicly available annual report of their findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cyber Security Strategy 2023–2030, released in August 2023, states that while “details of specific offensive cyber capabilities and operations remain classified, we are committed to transparency about the rights and obligations that govern their use”. However, the Australian government remains vague about these details and what strategic objectives guide its use of offensive cyber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What has been made public is that offensive cyber is used to support military operations, disrupt cybercrime and “enable ASD to manipulate, disrupt or degrade our adversaries’ capability”. The Strategy also states that Australia will “amplify our domestic law enforcement and offensive cyber activities to make Australia a harder target for cyber criminals”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Australia has made small improvements to the transparency of its offensive cyber capabilities, more must be done. Public dialogue and increased accountability on these capabilities will promote international engagement on states’ rights and obligations in this realm; facilitate collaboration between policymakers, academics and the private sector on responsible and effective cyber capabilities; and help improve the ability of offensive cyber to act as a deterrent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;accountability-and-transparency-from-mirage-to-commitment&quot;&gt;Accountability and Transparency: From Mirage to Commitment?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gatra Priyandita&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the approaches vary, a common thread among these countries is the recognition of cyberspace as a critical domain of national security and international engagement. From the Russian invasion of Ukraine and concerns about foreign surveillance to regime security considerations, the shifting landscape of global cyber security underscores the diverse approaches countries are adopting to harness their cyber capabilities. While not all of these countries have been transparent about the motivations driving their cyber capability development, their approaches demonstrate that the global framework on responsible state behaviour in cyberspace is insufficient – on its own – to ensure that states comply. The ability to deter cyber-enabled threats from state actors also requires investments in cyber capabilities. Given that military power is ultimately needed reinforce international law and norms, this is, of course, unsurprising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A common thread among these countries is the recognition of cyberspace as a critical domain of national security and international engagement&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for cyber capabilities to be effective instruments of diplomacy, states must also be transparent about their intentions. As with military power, developing cyber capabilities without some degree of transparency creates uncertainties, which breed distrust. While no state is expected to be completely open about the systems that make up its cyber security capabilities, it remains important that states demonstrate their commitment to the UN global framework of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace by establishing clear doctrines, ensuring rigorous oversight, and fostering transparency through engagements with both international and domestic partners. These elements not only enhance operational effectiveness but also contribute to the stability and security of the global cyber environment. As countries continue to evolve their cyber strategies, it is fundamental that they work to develop trust through confidence-building.&lt;/p&gt;

But with one major party boycotting the polls, their success hangs in the balance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iraq’s Kurdistan Region last held internal elections to its self-governing political institutions in September 2018. New elections to the Kurdistan Parliament were originally scheduled for October 2022, but internal tensions caused repeated postponements. The polls are now planned for 10 June. As a result of the knock-on effects caused by the earlier delays, they will be administered by Iraq’s federal government. One of the two ruling parties – the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) – plans to boycott the election as a protest against what it sees as unfair rules imposed by Baghdad. Observers already expected low turnout amid widespread voter dissatisfaction, but it could hit record lows given these unprecedented circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The democratic legitimacy of political institutions in the Kurdistan Region is at stake. The Kurdistan Parliament is no longer sitting, and the current Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) cabinet is functioning well beyond the time it would ordinarily be in office. Elections are necessary to renew the mandate of these institutions. Yet, there are urgent questions about whether the election process will be free and fair given the outsized ability of the ruling parties to prevent participation, influence voter behaviour, and subsequently control the institutions of government. What sort of democratic legitimacy such an election would confer is, therefore, an open question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This piece will seek to address several topics. First, does legitimacy in the Kurdistan Region actually come from elections, or does it originate from other sources? Second, will the elections in June confer legitimacy in the eyes of voters, political parties, and other stakeholders? Third, what will this mean for the future of the Kurdistan Region?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, failing to hold an election is worse than having an imperfect one because it makes it easier to foreclose the possibility of future, better elections. The Kurdistan Region’s parties should recommit to an inclusive, democratic process, including but not limited to elections. Outside players like the UN Assistance Mission for Iraq and foreign governments should be unwilling to accept anything less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a democracy, political legitimacy ideally comes from the people. Usually, this is conferred through free and regular votes on candidates and issues under conditions that allow for fair competition. The resulting institutions are able to accommodate transfers of power when they occur. However, the exact mechanisms for these processes differ from place to place due to political and historical development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kurdistan Region emerged in 1991 after a long struggle against the central government in Baghdad and, at that particular time, the Ba’athist dictatorship of Saddam Hussein. Just three years earlier, the Ba’athists had perpetrated the genocidal Anfal campaign. Creating self-governing Kurdish institutions was not a political science experiment to provide authentic representation for a minority group, but a necessary measure for survival and protection. The continued need for such a bulwark is evident amid recent efforts by Baghdad to rebalance power within Iraq’s federal system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These institutions were formed largely through a partnership between the KDP and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), which had fought Baghdad and each other for decades. As a result of this development path, the ruling parties have always been stronger than the state. To this day, party elites largely dictate governmental affairs through a variety of formal and informal mechanisms, elections being just one. This reflects – and validates – their military and administrative control over roughly half of the Kurdistan Region each. Even when the Gorran Movement beat the PUK in both the 2013 parliamentary election and the 2014 provincial election in Sulaymaniyah, the latter did not fully relinquish control over state institutions in a transfer of power. The imbalance between party and state complicates efforts to establish the democratic legitimacy of institutions and processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Elections in the Kurdistan Region are more political theatre than democratic substance, tending to validate pre-existing power dynamics rather than challenging them&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second important aspect of the Kurdistan Region’s political and historical development is the role played by international actors. This influence is evident from the no-fly zone that operated following the Gulf War, the 1998 Washington Agreement that ended the Kurdish civil war, the removal of Saddam Hussein, and the war against Islamic State. During each of these interventions, efforts were made to strengthen Kurdish political institutions. When international attention waned, the two ruling parties increased their influence over the state. As a consequence, the functionality of the KRG declined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The parties’ dependence on strong ties with the international community is evident in their media and propaganda. Foreign diplomats like the UK’s current consul general are given space in party-connected outlets to praise the Kurdistan Region. Routine meetings are turned into complex protocol events designed to stress the importance of officials from the Kurdish parties. A common refrain among opposition groups and disgruntled voters is that KDP and PUK officials are more responsive to international demands than the interests of Kurdish citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasingly, state bodies in Baghdad also wield significant influence over political affairs in the Kurdistan Region. Rulings by the Federal Supreme Court ended the latest term of the Kurdistan Parliament, eliminated the seats reserved for ethnic and religious minorities, and gave administrative control over elections to the federal electoral commission. The KDP in particular has complained bitterly about these decisions. While the party’s own self-interest clearly drives its objections, there is nevertheless no substantive mechanism for the Kurdish public to hold the federal court accountable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Control of state institutions by the ruling parties, the role of the international community, and interference from the federal state undercut notions that the KRG’s institutions derive their legitimacy from a popular mandate. As a result, elections in the Kurdistan Region are more political theatre than democratic substance. They tend to validate pre-existing power dynamics rather than challenging them. The initial emergence of Gorran in 2009 sought to change this paradigm, but the party was rapidly co-opted into the system. This is the dynamic that will confront voters in several weeks when they head to the polls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this state of affairs, establishing democratic legitimacy in the Kurdistan Region is baseline difficult. The specific circumstances of the 10 June election exacerbate efforts to do so in the eyes of voters, parties and other stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Past elections in the Kurdistan Region have been dogged by allegations of fraud perpetrated by the KDP and the PUK, which at the time controlled the regional electoral commission. The ruling parties allegedly used their patronage networks to force public servants to vote for whichever party was in control of their workplace or governorate. Without irony, each has accused the other of using this to their respective advantage. The opposition has also claimed that the KDP and the PUK misused voter cards and that members of the partisan-affiliated security forces voted more than once. There is far less international observation of regional elections than elections for the parliament in Baghdad, which does not aid transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dissatisfaction with governance in the Kurdistan Region and mistrust of the electoral process have resulted in progressively lower turnout. In the 2013 regional elections, 76% of voters in Duhok and 73% in Sulaymaniyah cast ballots, but this slid to 54% and 37% respectively in the 2021 federal parliamentary election, which was the last one held in the Kurdistan Region. Observers expect that turnout will continue to decline – a factor that counts against democratic legitimacy. Developments over the past few weeks have made this even more likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Both ruling parties enjoy massive structural advantages against the other parties in terms of campaign resources, media ownership, and the security forces&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elections for the Kurdistan Parliament were originally scheduled to occur on 1 October 2022. Disagreements between the KDP and the PUK over how the elections should be held caused an initial delay. Since then, multiple court cases related to an attempt to extend the Kurdistan Parliament’s mandate and the constitutionality of reserved minority seats have forced additional postponements. Previous elections were run by the Kurdistan Region’s own election commission – which was dominated by representatives of the KDP and the PUK – but the upcoming polls will be administered by the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The KDP has won the most votes in every election in the Kurdistan Region since 2005, but it will boycott the upcoming polls. In a statement, the party said that the Federal Supreme Court’s recent rulings are politicised and will result in “unconstitutional and undemocratic elections”. It particularly objected to the elimination of the seats reserved for religious and ethnic minorities, which critics argued were de facto controlled by the KDP. No other major Kurdish parties support the boycott, and they intend to go forward with the elections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The KDP leadership fears that it will lose seats under these circumstances – it would say unfairly – and will be forced into working with the PUK to form a government, which it had hoped to avoid. The party’s decision is unprecedented, and it is hard to predict what the consequences will be for the future of the Kurdistan Region. In a democracy, there would be some kind of accountability for not participating in an election, but the KDP’s grip over the security forces in Erbil and Duhok governorates means that it will remain in power in those areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if the KDP had chosen to participate in the election, it is hard to see how the polls would have been free and fair enough to enhance the democratic legitimacy of Kurdish self-governing institutions. The biometric voting machines currently in use in Iraq address methods of fraud used in past elections, but the pressure that the KDP and the PUK exert on voters through social and patronage networks means that voting is not always entirely free. Moreover, both ruling parties enjoy massive structural advantages against the other parties in terms of campaign resources, media ownership, and the security forces which mean that the elections are definitely not fair. Turnout will likely hit a record low as a result of voter apathy and the KDP’s boycott.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situation puts the Kurdistan Region’s foreign partners in a difficult position. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, for example, pleaded for elections to go forward with all parties participating during a press conference on 5 April. Far more than the KDP and the PUK, Western governments need an election in the Kurdistan Region in order to claim that they are working with a like-minded government that shares their democratic values, as is regularly claimed. This was always a conceit, but it has become an increasingly fragile edifice since 2018. How this election plays out may force difficult choices that have been some time in coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, many practical matters are uncertain. Much depends on the KDP’s behaviour. If it prevents campaigning or voting in Erbil and Duhok, it will violate the constitutional rights of Kurdish voters in order to serve its narrow self-interest. If it prevents the next Kurdistan Parliament from sitting in Erbil, it will fundamentally break the KRG. It is vitally important to understand that the KDP’s actions represent a choice that it did not necessarily have to take. The international actors that serve as a source of legitimacy for the KDP and the PUK must weigh in strongly against these anti-democratic impulses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the needs or interests of the KDP, the PUK or the international community, the Kurdish public deserves a government that operates with democratic legitimacy. It is incumbent on all stakeholders to provide credible, free and fair elections now. Failing to do so harms the chances that elections will continue to occur in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evolution of the phrase “Indo-Pacific” from a term of art in marine biology to a region of contemporary strategic interest has been a key geopolitical development in the past 15 years. Although the desire to draw India into the security architecture of the Asia-Pacific was a key motivation for countries such as the US and Japan to embrace the formulation, New Delhi was initially more cautious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s growing influence in South Asia and the Indian Ocean, however, prompted the adoption of the Indo-Pacific concept, which has become a cornerstone of India’s foreign policy. Demonstrating strategic adaptability in a changing geopolitical landscape marked by varying priorities among key stakeholders, India’s approach involves pragmatically working with varying sets of long-standing friends and emerging partners on specific issues. This could position India as a key bridge linking a variety of different actors. However, New Delhi’s geographic priorities differ markedly from its Quad partners, meaning its will and capacity for leadership in the Indian Ocean are far greater than in the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that India has put its support behind the notion of a “Free and Open Indo-Pacific”, other countries with similar objectives – for example, the UK – may view this as an avenue to develop a more meaningful strategic partnership with Delhi. Doing so, however, requires an understanding of the role of the Indo-Pacific in India’s strategic outlook. This policy brief examines the reasons for India’s initial caution in embracing the concept, the changing geopolitical circumstances that led New Delhi to adopt a more proactive approach, and how India’s Indo-Pacific strategy is impacting relationships with countries in the region, including Quad member states, ASEAN and countries in the Western Indian Ocean (WIO). The brief concludes with an analysis of the implications for the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;initial-indo-pacific-hesitation&quot;&gt;Initial Indo-Pacific Hesitation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the Indo-Pacific framework originated externally, the idea that India had a role to play beyond the Indian Ocean region is not new. The British Raj had managed colonies in Southeast Asia from Calcutta and before independence Indian strategic thinkers argued the region would remain vital to the security of independent India. In the 1950s and 1960s, India organised major anti-colonial conferences and oversaw the implementation of the 1954 Geneva Accords that ended the First Indochinese War. Following the 1962 war with China, India pulled back from the broader region for a time, but with its economy liberalising, India launched the “Look East” policy in 1992, aiming to deepen economic and cultural engagement with Southeast Asia. In 2014 the policy evolved into “Act East”, incorporating a maritime security dimension and broadening its scope to include East Asia. The following year India launched its Security and Growth for All in the Region (SAGAR) initiative, which seeks to enhance maritime security, promote sustainable development, and foster cooperation among Indian Ocean littoral states. With a focus on connectivity and trade, these efforts are precursors to India’s Indo-Pacific strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although India is central to other states’ Indo-Pacific strategies, a combination of geopolitical, strategic and regional considerations meant New Delhi lagged behind Tokyo, Canberra and Washington, DC, among others, in adopting the concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, discomfort with the “Indo-Pacific” concept stemmed from the perception that it was a strategy to contain China. In the mid-2010s, India sought to balance its strategic relationships with China and major democratic states in Asia. Some of the smaller states in South and Southeast Asia also viewed the Indo-Pacific framework as explicitly anti-China. A hurried adoption risked alienating neighbours who wished to steer clear of taking sides in a potential US–China rivalry or a localised India–China competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adoption of the concept by US partners and allies raised concerns that aligning with Western powers might compromise India’s strategic autonomy. Despite a robust strategic partnership with the US, New Delhi sought to maintain its strategic autonomy and avoid the perception of aligning lockstep with Washington’s Asian policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, India’s priorities for the Indo-Pacific were distinct from early adopters such as Australia, Japan and the US, who emphasised the Pacific over the Indian Ocean, and in some cases only conceived of the Indo-Pacific as reaching as far west as Gujarat. In doing so, they implicitly encouraged India’s involvement in the maritime Asia-Pacific while excluding themselves from engaging with the regions of greatest priority for India. Bolstering India’s position in the Indian Ocean and ensuring its interests are not challenged is New Delhi’s main focus in the Indo-Pacific. The Indian Ocean’s sea lanes are pivotal for India’s energy security and economic prosperity. Threats in this region could jeopardise India’s security and undermine efforts to project influence abroad. The sub-region of secondary importance for India is the Persian Gulf, which is a key source of energy imports as well as overseas trade. The Pacific, in contrast, is not as central to India’s immediate strategic and geoeconomic interests. New Delhi’s prioritisation of the Indian Ocean, along with concerns about differing priorities among Indo-Pacific partners, led India to carefully navigate its role in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;embracing-the-indo-pacific&quot;&gt;Embracing the Indo-Pacific&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, despite India’s effort to reassure China that it was not joining in a balancing or containment coalition, it was China’s perceived intrusion into the Indian Ocean in a manner that challenged New Delhi’s strategic interests that would catalyse India’s embrace of the concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relationship between India and China is characterised by both cooperation and tension. Both nations aspire to have a greater voice in international affairs, often aligning in forums such as the G20 and climate change negotiations. They are also both part of new institutions – such as the BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization – which exclude the US and its allies. Bilateral economic links are robust, with two-way trade reaching $113.8 billion in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the long-standing dispute over their Himalayan border – compounded by China’s military buildup and support for Pakistan – contributes to friction, as does India’s hosting of the Dalai Lama and the exiled Tibetan government. India’s $83-billion trade deficit with China adds further strain. Whether skipping New Delhi’s G20 summit, blocking its membership in the Nuclear Suppliers Group or failing to support its bid for a UN Security Council seat, since 2016 China has repeatedly been a barrier to India’s aspirations for global influence. Even within the BRICS, India seeks to leverage south–south cooperation to further reform the international financial system in opposition to China’s efforts to use the grouping as a counterweight to the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closer to home, Chinese economic and political engagement with Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh and the Maldives through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in the early 2010s raised concerns that India’s influence in South Asia was being undermined as some of these governments began to tilt towards Beijing. In the same time period, Chinese transgressions of the disputed border increased sharply, culminating in violent border clashes in May 2020 which caused fatalities on both sides for the first time in 45 years. While both sides express a desire for stability, in the face of subsequent clashes in January 2021, January 2022 and November 2022, India has shifted its strategy, emphasising capability-building and development of external partnerships over accommodating Chinese concerns in the hope of reciprocity. Although some blame India’s pursuit of Indo-Pacific partnerships for China’s aggressive behavior, the growing geopolitical challenge clarified the need for India to strengthen relations with like-minded countries, and adopt a more favourable view of the Indo-Pacific concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India’s changing perceptions of the Indo-Pacific framework were not solely reactions to China’s actions. During his 2007 visit to India, Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made a parliamentary speech introducing the concept of the “confluence of the two seas”, emphasising the connectedness of the Pacific and Indian oceans. His later endeavours to champion a “free and open Indo-Pacific” aligned with India’s desire for inclusive regional architecture, complementing India’s Act East Policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the Indian strategic community, defence analysts adopted the “Indo-Pacific” concept long before it received official imprimatur. The Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (IDSA), a think tank which has semi-official status under the Ministry of Defence, published its first article on the Indo-Pacific in 2007, with the author retrospectively claiming to have been the first to have proposed the concept in print. In October 2015, the term “Indo-Pacific” gained official recognition as a coherent region in the Indian Navy’s Maritime Security Strategy and two months later Japan and India issued a joint vision statement affirming an “unwavering commitment to realize a peaceful, open, equitable, stable and rule-based order in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2018, the Indo-Pacific had progressed from a recognised region to an official policy framework as India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi articulated India’s vision for the region in a keynote address at the Shangri-La Dialogue. The following year, the Ministry of External Affairs established an Indo-Pacific division with responsibility for key regional associations such as the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA), ASEAN and the Quad. Organisationally, this new department was placed alongside divisions with responsibility for East Asia, Southeast Asia and Oceania – all reporting to the same secretary – enhancing the coherency of India’s approach to the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;indias-indo-pacific-strategy&quot;&gt;India’s Indo-Pacific Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India has not published a formal Indo-Pacific strategy – and as a matter of course does not publish a national security strategy or defence white paper – however, actions and policy statements indicate that the concept has become a key reference point for its strategic outlook. Indian policymakers envision the Indo-Pacific as a vast expanse extending from East Africa to the Americas. Contrary to the “Asia-Pacific” frame – which placed India on the periphery – under the Indo-Pacific construct, India’s central position at the Indian Ocean’s midpoint puts it at the heart of a key geostrategic and geoeconomic domain of the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India’s main Indo-Pacific priority is maintaining the region’s inclusiveness and openness. New Delhi endorses the vision of a “free and open Indo-Pacific”, where all countries adhere to international law and benefit from freedom of navigation. The region’s role as a conduit for global trade and energy resources has led India to focus on augmenting maritime domain awareness and safeguarding crucial sea lanes, accompanied by connectivity initiatives to bolster trade and investment links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India’s Indo-Pacific approach rests on four pillars:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Collaborating with countries to address shared concerns with via issue-based partnerships. This involves active participation in regional forums, “mini-laterals”, and security dialogues. To date, the US, Japan, Australia and France have arisen as key partners for India in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Avoiding what Modi referred to as “alliances of containment”. In working with partners, India will advance shared values and not compel others to choose sides in a dispute (for example, US v. China or China v. India).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Embracing evolution rather than revolution in regional order. Aware that norms and rules in the Indo-Pacific are likely to change over time, India supports the adoption of new principles that are freely arrived at in accordance with international law and respect for sovereignty rather than unilaterally imposed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recognising regional institutions and groupings as an important underpinning of future order. India supports ASEAN centrality in the evolving Indo-Pacific regional architecture, but also works with groupings such as the Quad, IORA and the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), among others.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;india-in-the-indo-pacific&quot;&gt;India in the Indo-Pacific&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implementation of India’s Indo-Pacific strategy occurs through its interactions with key states in the region. This section explores these dynamics, beginning with Quad member states and ASEAN and then turning attention to the WIO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-quad&quot;&gt;The Quad&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Quad partnership with the US, Japan and Australia is a key vehicle for India’s engagement with the Indo-Pacific. As a political deterrent, it allows India to address concerns vis-à-vis China in partnership with other states. Economic collaboration centres on shared apprehensions about China’s role in the global manufacturing supply chain, which exposes Quad countries to potential trade coercion. Quad cooperation on technological security and cybersecurity threats addresses India’s worries about China’s increasing technological capacity, particularly in telecommunications. Joint military exercises among the Quad members enhance their collective military capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Quad also facilitates a positive agenda for the Indo-Pacific by providing a platform for multilateral initiatives like vaccine diplomacy, alternative debt financing, emerging technologies, infrastructure development, maritime security, humanitarian assistance and combating illegal fishing, which promote peace and prosperity in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India’s enthusiasm for the Quad is tempered by diplomatic challenges. New Delhi does not favour the group evolving into a formal treaty alliance and it wants to ensure a robust Quad does not hinder bilateral negotiations with China on various disputes, should the need arise. Opposition from Russia – a key arms and technology provider – to the Indo-Pacific concept also requires delicate diplomatic manoeuvering to avoid seeing Moscow move closer to Beijing. Further, as discussed below, the depth and quality of India’s bilateral relations with the individual Quad countries is uneven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of its Quad partners, New Delhi has the greatest degree of strategic trust in Tokyo. Geopolitically, both nations are committed to upholding the rules-based international order. Japan’s role as a major investor in India, particularly in key infrastructure projects, demonstrates a shared commitment to fostering economic growth and development. The two countries have announced a wide range of joint initiatives over time, yet they have been slow to achieve implementation as the bureaucracies of the two countries struggle to collaborate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As India’s largest export market, second-largest defence supplier and preferred partner for joint military exercises, the strategic partnership with the US is arguably its most important bilateral relationship. Shared concerns about China, terrorism and Indo-Pacific security have allowed the two to transcend Cold War differences. At times significant differences on climate change, free trade, as well as relations with Russia and Iran, not to mention persistent suspicions among some Indian elites about US dependability have affected the pace at which the two countries deepen their partnership, but the overall trajectory of the bilateral relationship is unmistakable. In some respects, the Indo-US relationship is the inverse of that of India and Japan in that the achievements are significant but the trust has been slow to develop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although “mutual indifference” no longer characterises Indo-Australian ties, they lack the breadth and depth of India’s partnerships with the other Quad members. Both nations share concerns about regional stability, maritime security and revisionist powers in the Indo-Pacific, which likely led India to vote against Chinese and Russian efforts to disrupt the AUKUS agreement at the International Atomic Energy Agency. Mutual concerns about China, however, have not been enough to bridge significant differences. India seeks a multi-polar world while Australia relies on US preeminence for its national security. Australian strategists question India’s strategic role in the region, given its anaemic funding for its navy, while India see Australia as less relevant than Japan or the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;asean&quot;&gt;ASEAN&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ASEAN is a cornerstone of India’s “Act East” policy and its broader Indo-Pacific foreign policy. Delhi’s focus is on enhancing physical and digital connectivity – exemplified by projects like the India–Myanmar–Thailand Trilateral Highway – to foster economic integration and people-to-people ties. ASEAN–India trade topped $131 billion in 2023 and investment flows are equally strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the importance of Southeast Asia to India’s outreach east of Malacca, interaction with ASEAN highlights the limits of Delhi’s engagement. Continued aversion to further opening the Indian economy – as exemplified by withdrawal from negotiations over the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) multilateral trade agreement – is seen as a key obstacle to further regional economic integration and closer strategic partnership. Doubts also persist in Southeast Asia about India’s capacity to contribute to global peace, security and governance. This reflects the uneven quality of New Delhi’s engagement across Southeast Asia wherein countries like Vietnam and Singapore are close partners, but bilateral relations with other states are underdeveloped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;western-indian-ocean&quot;&gt;Western Indian Ocean&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The WIO and the Gulf are of greater priority for India than Southeast Asia. It is not surprising that the 2015 Maritime Security Strategy identified the WIO as a priority theatre given that the Persian Gulf and the broader Middle East account for 61% of its crude oil imports and trade with the Arab world exceeded $240 billion in 2023. Furthermore, an estimated 10 million Indians work in the Gulf, providing annual remittances of some $36 billion. Collectively, the countries of the region are more important than China, Southeast Asia or the US for Indian trade flows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the “mission-based deployment” strategy, combat vessels of the Indian navy have been stationed in the WIO to carry out policing, disaster relief and other missions as needed. India has worked to enhance the maritime security capacity of small island nations like Seychelles and Mauritius, providing helicopters and patrol vessels as well as undertaking patrols of their exclusive economic zones. Seconded Indian officers serve as senior naval advisors for both countries that also host Indian costal radar systems as part of a broader maritime domain awareness network. Further afield, the Indian navy has undertaken trilateral exercises with Madagascar and Tanzania as well as a significant anti-piracy mission in the Gulf of Aden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India’s single most important partner in the WIO is France. This collaboration encompasses various domains, including defence, maritime security and economic ties. Both nations share a commitment to a rules-based order and the Indian Ocean serves as a focal point for their joint efforts. In the realm of defence cooperation, France and India have engaged in joint naval exercises, enhancing interoperability and strengthening maritime capabilities. A reciprocal logistics support agreement allows the militaries of each country to be replenished by the other and the two sides have conducted joint maritime patrols in the IOR – the first time India has done so with a major Western power. The French presence in the Indian Ocean through territories like Reunion Island and Djibouti complements India’s strategic interests in safeguarding vital sea lanes and countering security threats. This cooperation extends to intelligence sharing, counterterrorism efforts and capacity building to address common challenges in the region. Economically, France is a key partner for India in sectors like aerospace, infrastructure development and renewable energy. The Indo-French collaboration in the Indian Ocean region includes initiatives such as the Indo-Pacific Triangular Development Fund, focusing on sustainable development projects and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications-for-the-uk&quot;&gt;Implications for the UK&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has long wished to deepen its strategic engagement with India, but lags behind the US, Russia, France and Japan as partners of choice for Delhi. In part this is a consequence of the protracted Brexit process, which created uncertainty about the UK’s priorities. Thus, the declaration of a tilt to the Indo-Pacific in general and outreach to India in particular encapsulated in the 2021 Integrated Review has been welcomed in Delhi. Clear signs that the UK is concerned by Chinese activity in the region and their willingness to declare China to be a “systemic challenge” has helped assuage Indian concerns that developed as a consequence of the Cameron government’s attempts to foster closer ties with China in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dynamics of India’s approach to the Indo-Pacific offer opportunities for engagement. Counterterrorism, anti-piracy operations, supply chain resilience, climate change and renewable energy are shared priorities for the UK and India. For India’s Quad partners, the Pacific takes priority over the western stretches of the Indian Ocean that Delhi considers a priority. The UK, in contrast, has a diplomatic presence in every country in the WIO except for the Comoros and is the only European nation with an embassy in the Maldives. With its long-standing ties to the Gulf and network of Commonwealth countries in East Africa, Britain has long been playing a role as a “security provider” in the region; working with partners to help make these zones more secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many states in the WIO are not well equipped to counter criminal activity and non-traditional security threats in their territorial waters. Consequently, there is not only an opportunity for the UK and India to cooperate in this part of the region, but also a real need. Working to enhance the ability of small states to combat economic challenges in their exclusive economic zones, such as piracy and overfishing, are primarily law enforcement efforts, however, they can constrain the ability of external powers to encroach, while helping to uphold international law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite initial hesitation, the Indo-Pacific framework has emerged as a defining element of India’s foreign policy. While its adoption was catalysed by China’s growing economic and military involvement in the Indian Ocean and South Asia, the Indo-Pacific concept has provided India with a strategic blueprint for its broader foreign policy agenda. New Delhi’s advocacy of a rules-based regional order, its promotion of economic integration, and efforts to enhance maritime security are not merely a reactive response to a changing world, but a proactive shift in foreign policy. Embracing strategic flexibility in an evolving geopolitical landscape where the priorities of key actors vary, New Delhi’s approach is to undertake issue-based collaboration with old friends or new partners as circumstances warrant. Unlike its Quad partners, New Delhi’s geographical focus is on the Indian Ocean. Consequently, there are untapped prospects for nations like the UK possessing strategic interests in the IOR to deepen their involvement with India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（29日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第68日審訊。陳梓華繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供，並接受辯方盤問。陳承認有協助李宇軒偷渡離港，包括聯絡其他人安排「安全屋」和船家等，亦將「升旗易得道」成員陳世德交給李。惟陳否認帶領勇武小隊，亦否認曾向李講過會擔任流亡政府的領袖和訓練軍隊。另外，辯方指警方在2021年5月7日至2024年1月15日期間，合共65次到訪荔枝角收押所或小欖精神病治療中心會見陳，歷時總共65小時。陳稱在65次會面均沒有與警察談及本案證供，僅談及身體狀況、情緒和還柙生活，「一開始，都係經常性我情緒上好崩潰，去到後來我會講吓啲生活嘢囉⋯⋯講吓，因為我喺裡面我係睇唔到太陽，所以真係講吓生活嗰啲嘢，真係想知。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已認罪的被告陳梓華第10天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。由代表黎智英的紐西蘭御用大律師 Marc Corlett 盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華承認有協助李宇軒離開香港-被捕後向警稱沒有協助屬假話&quot;&gt;陳梓華承認有協助李宇軒離開香港 被捕後向警稱沒有協助屬「假話」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示陳梓華的錄影會面謄本，就其有否協助李宇軒離開香港，陳當時向警察稱：「我冇協助李宇軒離開香港。佢曾經有詢問過『有冇船可以離開香港？』，當時我對佢嘅回答係，我本人從來冇參與，亦都唔相信有船能夠成功抵達台灣。但係我知道，出面有人係講緊，你可以去問其他人，去搵到嗰啲所謂船家嘅聯絡方式，睇吓有冇機會。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問上述供詞是真實還是虛假。陳起初稱不懂如何回答此問題，但是法官李運騰指問題並非法律問題，而是事實問題。陳最終回答：「當時係假話。」辯方再問，陳當時是有協助李宇軒離開香港，陳同意有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示另一段供詞，陳向警察稱：「整件事上面，之前佢（李）偷渡，我本人冇資助過佢一分一毫，更莫講話協助佢離開香港。」陳確認他有向警察說過上述說話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華承認有向李宇軒介紹人安排偷渡船&quot;&gt;陳梓華承認有向李宇軒介紹人安排偷渡船&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另一段供詞亦顯示，陳向警察稱：「佢（李）第一天去保釋嘅時候，已經透過 Telegram 打電話畀我，問我有冇船可以畀到佢，令佢離開到香港去台灣。『去台灣』就冇講嘅；『能夠離開香港』，問得好清晰嘅。我答得佢好清晰嘅：冇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到上述供詞是真還是假，陳稱是「假話」。陳稱，在李保釋出來之後的第一通 Telegram Call 之中，「當時佢（李）需要地方住，佢話需要一間安全屋。然後佢話，佢畀人拉咗，佢部電話所有嘢都曝晒光，佢覺得我應該走，然後佢需要支援。我當時話，睇吓有冇人幫到佢。」陳稱二人並沒有談及離開香港，但之後的通話中則有。就安排偷渡船方面，陳承認「我有介紹人畀佢（李）識」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華確認替李宇軒搭路聯絡升旗易得道成員陳世德&quot;&gt;陳梓華確認替李宇軒「搭路」聯絡「升旗易得道」成員陳世德&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另一段供詞顯示，陳向警察稱，李宇軒不想回家，「想睇吓有冇安全屋嗰啲。咁跟住之後我話 Okay，我幫佢問吓啦，安排吓啦咁樣樣。咁我哋都有提及過所謂嘅反跟蹤，有啲咩嘢技巧呀咁樣樣。」陳確認他有在通話中與李談及「安全屋」和反跟蹤；他亦有在 Telegram 上聯絡一名叫「Kyle」的人，有關安全屋的事宜。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，陳梓華有否將一名叫陳世德的人的聯絡方式交給李宇軒。陳確認有，其後李宇軒有告訴他，已經與陳世德聯絡上，並且已經安全。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;翻查報道，陳世德為 YouTube 頻道「升旗易得道」成員、「Friends of Hong Kong」前發言人。據10.1荃灣中槍學生曾志健的承認案情，陳世德於2020年主動接觸他，不斷游說他逃離香港。陳亦要求曾拍攝片段引起其他國家關注及籌款，威脅若曾不遵從，便不會安排他離港。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華另確認他有聯絡一名叫「Cap」的人，「當時佢話佢可以提供到協助。」陳確認，「Cap」向李宇軒提供釣魚工具和船家的聯絡方式，以讓李掩飾他身處船上的目的。陳亦確認後來李告訴他，已經聯絡上「Cap」，並準備乘船出發；在李登船之前，李亦有聯絡陳，表示準備離開香港。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，陳梓華有否告訴李宇軒，當他到達台灣之後，要自首和尋求協助。陳則稱：「我唔記得係咪我講。」辯方又問陳有否跟李宇軒說，當他獲台灣當局釋放之後，要乘坐捷克官員的私人包機前往捷克。惟陳否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華確認其法律代表於2021年5月去信律政司作認罪協商&quot;&gt;陳梓華確認其法律代表於2021年5月去信律政司作認罪協商&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指2021年5月7日，代表陳梓華的劉豹律師行去信律政司，提出在陳承認「串謀勾結外國勢力危害國家安全」的情況下，律政司可考慮另一項「協助罪犯」控罪留法庭存檔。至同年5月21日，律政司回覆事務律師行，表示接受提議，同意「協助罪犯」控罪留法庭存檔。最終陳承認了「串謀勾結外國勢力危害國家安全」罪，「協助罪犯」罪則存檔。陳確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華否認帶領勇武小隊-亦否認曾告訴李宇軒其小隊牽涉數宗暴力事件&quot;&gt;陳梓華否認帶領「勇武小隊」 亦否認曾告訴李宇軒其小隊牽涉數宗暴力事件&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，陳梓華上週供稱他並非「勇武小隊」的成員，也沒有參與示威活動中的暴力行為。辯方今再問陳是否帶領一隊或多於一隊「勇武小隊」，陳否認。辯方又問陳是否視「勇武」為一種手段，營造一種香港政府不能有效地管治香港的印象。陳亦不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在辯方盤問下，陳梓華確認他在大約2019年7至8月的時候，叫李宇軒到火炭工業區一幢建築物出席分享會，同場有一名叫「Captain」的男子和一名叫「Cath」的女子，惟另一名叫「Cap」的車手，以及一名叫「廢老」的男子則當日不在場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問陳梓華有否告訴過李宇軒，「Captain」是勇武小隊的隊長，而「Cath」是負責「科學實驗」、製造爆炸品和汽油彈；亦表示知道勇武小隊儲藏爆炸品的地方。陳否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又問，陳有否告訴過李，陳自己的勇武小隊曾經涉及7.21白衣人事件、中聯辦外的騷亂事件、2020年農曆新年之前邊境口岸的爆炸品事件，以及大埔有人開槍的事件。陳一概否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳補充，當時介紹「Captain」和「Cath」給李宇軒的時候，「佢哋自己講嘅，都只係話自己係前線抗爭者，我唔會同佢（李）講到畀佢聽，佢哋有做過炸彈或者任何嘢。」他又稱在當日的交流會中，「我冇講過我有一隊勇武小隊，做過啱啱講過嘅任何嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，在同一場合中，有沒有任何人向李提及上述事件。陳回答：「確實有可能。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在辯方的盤問下，陳梓華表示他相信「Captain」和「Cath」都是勇武小隊的成員，惟「Captain」並不是隊長。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華否認說過負責訓練軍隊或以色列可提供訓練&quot;&gt;陳梓華否認說過負責訓練軍隊或以色列可提供訓練&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問陳梓華，在過往任何場合之中，陳有否向李宇軒談及如果成立到流亡政府的話，陳會擔任領袖；如果成立到軍隊的話，便會由陳及勇武派負責訓練軍隊。陳否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，陳有否告訴過李，以色列軍隊可以向勇武派提供訓練。陳亦否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱有提出配合警方調查-直至決定做控方證人之前共會見警察6次&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱有提出配合警方調查 直至決定做控方證人之前共會見警察6次&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方庭上展示陳梓華與警方會見的紀錄列表，並指陳大約於2021年3月31日向警方提出轉做控方證人，其後在同年4月28日，陳首次以控方證人的身份進行錄影會面。陳確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，在2021年3月31日至4月28日期間，即由陳向警方提出直至他決定做控方證人的這段時間，警方與陳一共會面了6次，歷時合共為18小時。辯方問，在上述的會面裡，陳有否向警察提及證供內容，還是在4月28日才開始在會面中談及證供。惟陳表示沒有印象。辯方追問上述會面中談論了什麼。陳則指：「主要都係當時我嘅情緒。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;當辯方問及上述6次會面期間，陳是否記得警察有做任何手寫或電腦紀錄，陳則表示3月31日那次「好似有」，「但係我問可唔可以配合警方調查，其他我無印象。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;警到羈押所探訪65次-陳稱僅談情緒身體及還柙生活&quot;&gt;警到羈押所探訪65次 陳稱僅談情緒、身體及還柙生活&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方引述列表指，陳分別在2021年4月28日、4月29日和4月30日，一共與警方進行了4次錄影會面。另外，在2021年5月3日、5月4日、5月5日及2022年11月10日，警察替陳分別錄取了4份書面供詞。除了上述數次錄口供之外，警察在2021年5月7日至2024年1月15日期間，有到訪荔枝角收押所或小欖精神病治療中心會見陳，合共65次，歷時總共65小時。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問在該65次會面之中，陳與警察有否談及本案證供，惟陳表示沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又問陳與警察談論了什麼話題。陳則稱：「身體囉⋯⋯跟住，主要都係，講喺（羈押所）裡面嘅生活。」辯方再問還有什麼話題，陳稱：「抱怨囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指，該65次會面表面上似乎並不是錄取證供或進行錄影會面。陳同意，而且印象中也沒有任何協助他喚起記憶的事宜。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官遂問，陳會如何形容該些警察探訪或會面的目的。陳表示：「一開始，我以為係情緒上，要望一望我點。」他說這是一開始的想法，但是被問到後來有沒有改變，陳稱：「一開始，都係經常性我情緒上好崩潰，去到後來我會講吓啲生活嘢囉⋯⋯講吓，因為我喺裡面我係睇唔到太陽，所以真係講吓生活嗰啲嘢，真係想知。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官又表示，出於好奇，問陳梓華在小欖精神病治療中心還押期間，院方是否容許家人和朋友前來探訪。陳則指：「唔係所有囉，因為都要做申請。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後引述紀錄指，警察於2021年5月14日探訪陳梓華的時候，是到達小欖精神病治療中心，而非荔枝角收押所，問陳是否因為精神狀態而被轉移至小欖。惟陳表示不知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又問，就陳的精神狀態，有否任何醫生介入治療。陳表示沒有，亦確認他的精神狀況並非嚴重到要醫生介入。&lt;/p&gt;

A handful of recent public opinion polls indicated the speculation about South Korea’s nuclear ambitions. But a CSIS strategic elite survey shows that a nuclear South Korea is not in the offing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the face of an uncertain security environment — precipitated by wars in Europe and the Middle East, China’s assertive behavior, and North Korea’s campaign to develop weapons of mass destruction (WMD) — South Korea has witnessed increasingly open discussion about the previously taboo topic of national nuclear weapons capability. Recent public opinion polling suggests that over 76 percent of South Koreans favor a nuclear path. Concerns heightened in January 2023, when the president of South Korea raised the possibility that the country could deploy nuclear weapons rapidly given its scientific and technological prowess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSIS distributed an opinion poll to over 1,000 strategic elites in South Korea between January 15 and March 17, 2024, on this question. This demographic was selected because the views of strategic elites — defined as academics, think tank experts, business elites, legislators, and officials (current and former) — is understood to better reflect both the state of national discussion and the views influential in decisionmaking on issues of national security. Key findings of this study run contrary to the public discussion of this issue:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two-thirds of South Korea’s strategic elites do not favor nuclearization of South Korea (66 percent opposed or uncertain), while only one-third support it (34 percent).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 34 percent of strategic elites who support nuclearization is a significantly lower number than the oft-cited 76 percent support of the general public and is a better indicator of the current attitudes of South Korea toward the nuclear option.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main reason South Korea’s strategic elites do not favor nuclearization is the consequences in terms of international condemnation, reputational costs, and sanctions, highlighting the value that elites place on South Korea’s global status in the rules-based international order.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strategic elite opposition to a nuclear South Korea, however, is not unconditional. Should abandonment fears regarding the U.S. security commitment come to fruition (such as the withdrawal of U.S. ground troops by a future U.S. administration), 51 percent of those opposed to nuclearization would become supportive of this path.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thirteen percent of elites remain uncertain about nuclearization, representing a substantial group whose opinions can be shaped by factors such as alliance assurances, adversary threats, and similar means.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strategic elites who support nuclearization favor the acquisition of autonomous nuclear capabilities by a two-to-one margin over a nuclear sharing option; those who do not support nuclearization, if pressed, most prefer nuclear sharing over indigenous capabilities by an almost five-to-one margin.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea faces an increasingly uncertain security environment. The way conflicts have erupted in Europe and the Middle East demonstrates that devastating war is more than a remote possibility in Asia. China’s growing military assertiveness against Taiwan raises concerns about the possibility of simultaneous conflicts on the peninsula and across the Taiwan Strait that could stretch the defense capabilities of Seoul’s primary security benefactor. On the peninsula, the security situation is far from tranquil. Since 2005, North Korea has conducted 180 ballistic missile tests and six nuclear tests. It enshrined nuclear weapons status permanently into the constitution over a decade ago and stipulated its right to preemptive use of nuclear weapons in September 2022. It is seeking the second leg of the nuclear triad in a sea-based capability and tactical nuclear weapons to use in war. Kim Jong-un’s legacy-seeking ambition is to become a nuclear weapons state on par with France or the United Kingdom by the end of the decade. All diplomatic efforts at negotiating away North Korea’s nuclear weapons have failed, with the last actual dismantlement efforts and international inspections taking place during the Six Party talks almost two decades ago. International sanctions pressure on North Korea has significantly decreased with Chinese and Russian non-compliance, and the UN Security Council, once unanimous in its 10 previous resolutions on North Korea, has been stymied from action by Moscow and Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dim picture has led to heightened speculation that South Korea will inevitably head down the nuclear path. Scholars and opinion leaders have forcefully argued the logic of why South Korea should pursue nuclearization. Twice before, this critical U.S. ally has tried to develop nuclear weapons clandestinely, starting nearly a half-century ago. Moreover, recent South Korean opinion polling points to most of the public asserting that their country should acquire nuclear weapons — or, at a minimum, call for the return of U.S. tactical nuclear weapons to the Korean Peninsula. South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol broke taboo when he stated his belief that South Korea could easily and quickly develop nuclear weapons given its high levels of science and technology expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is South Korea the next nuclear weapons state? The stakes of this question are exceedingly high. A nuclear South Korea could severely damage its alliance with the United States, as it would be tantamount to a statement of no-confidence in the U.S. security guarantee. A nuclear South Korea could also set off a “nuclear domino chain” among other states in the region, including Japan and Taiwan. It could create crisis instability on the peninsula, tempting North Korea to act preemptively. It could create insecurity spirals with Russia, China, and Japan, which would see new strategic threats from the peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerns about a nuclear South Korea are so high that they have been a driver of alliance politics. The subtext of the highly successful April 2023 state visit by President Yoon to the White House was a set of agreements designed to manage any nuclear aspirations by South Korea. The creation of the Washington Declaration and the Nuclear Consultative Group in 2023 had two purposes. One was to shore up allied deterrence against the burgeoning WMD threat from North Korea, but the other was to assure South Korea of the credibility of the U.S. nuclear umbrella such that it did not contemplate its own nuclear path. Washington even sought in writing a commitment from Seoul to remain a non-nuclear state in the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) as part of the Washington Declaration. These developments reinforce the impression that South Korea is on the verge of a nuclear breakout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on new and original data, however, this report concludes that concerns about a nuclear South Korea are exaggerated. A minority of South Korean foreign policy thinkers — only 34 percent — believe that their government should consider the nuclear option, while upwards of 66 percent disagree or remain uncertain about such a proposition. Confidence in the United States as a security provider remains strong. But this policy judgment is far from unconditional and permanent. If security deficits emerge on the peninsula, and U.S. security commitments lose credibility, then South Korean support for going nuclear would increase dramatically. More specifically, if Donald Trump returns to the presidency with an “America First” policy that denigrates alliances and seeks the retrenchment of U.S. security commitments, then support for a nuclear capability by South Korea among non-nuclear advocates would grow exponentially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A minority of South Korean foreign policy thinkers — only 34 percent — believe that their government should consider the nuclear option, while upwards of 66 percent disagree or remain uncertain about such a proposition.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report’s conclusions differ from those of the oft-cited opinion polls in South Korea because they are gleaned from the views of strategic elites, not the general public. Strategic elites are defined here as academic scholars, think tank experts, legislators, business decisionmakers, and officials (both current and former). As scholars have argued, major decisions about a government’s national security reflect the views of elites rather than the public — even in a period of increasing populism and resentment of elites — because elites enjoy control of resources, have access to or are themselves top decisionmakers, often have domain-specific knowledge, and can define narratives on national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the speculation in Washington and Seoul about South Korea’s nuclear ambitions has been informed by a handful of recent public opinion polls. This has created an echo chamber effect where many pundits have accepted South Korean nuclear ambitions as a reality. Moreover, of the 55 public polls collected on this question, none have bothered to analyze the views of policy experts and elites. This is the first U.S. study, reaching out to over 1,000 South Korean elites, that highlights how the vast majority of respondents in this group are far more cautious about, and resistant to, South Korea going nuclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Is South Korea the next nuclear weapons state? The stakes of this question are exceedingly high . . . [polls have] created an echo chamber effect where many pundits have accepted South Korean nuclear ambitions as a reality.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the lack of enthusiasm for nuclear weapons among South Korean experts, this study offers several other novel findings. For one, there is approximately two times more support for remaining non-nuclear than going nuclear among policy elites. Two, reputational costs and international condemnation is a more important motivating factor in preserving South Korea’s non-nuclear status than damage to the U.S. alliance. Three, those who are positive on nuclearization mostly prefer doing so through indigenous development of a South Korean capability, rather than other possible options (e.g., returning U.S. tactical nuclear weapons to the peninsula or a nuclear sharing arrangement). Those who oppose nuclearization, if pressed, tend to prefer nuclear sharing arrangements with the United States over going it alone. Finally, more than half of those opposed to South Korean nuclearization would change their minds if the United States proved to be an unreliable security partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;public-opinion-polls-on-south-korean-nuclearization&quot;&gt;Public Opinion Polls on South Korean Nuclearization&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been a plethora of opinion polls on South Korean nuclearization. A handful of recent polls have captured global attention because they report strong public support for a nuclear option in the face of North Korea’s unrelenting WMD ambitions. This has led some to speculate and even advocate for Seoul to take this path. The rationale is that if North Korea acquires a survivable nuclear capability, there are few in the United States who would be willing to trade San Francisco for Seoul despite reassurances to the contrary. This has led some to conclude that “Koreans are concerned that their country would meet the same fate as Ukraine — another non-nuclear state attacked by its nuclear-armed neighbor.” Such arguments operate from the logic that South Korean national security decisionmakers cannot count on U.S. intentions and commitment, and therefore the country would do well to develop its own deterrent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of this project, researchers created a dataset of nuclear polls to understand better their overall significance, collecting 55 polls from 2010 to 2023. These were divided between polls taken of the public prior to and after September 2017, which was when North Korea conducted its sixth nuclear test. The first observation is that the polls were uniformly brief in their questioning. The majority consisted of a question asking simply whether the respondent was in favor or against (or undecided) on the question of South Korea going nuclear. An oft-asked question was, “Should South Korea have its own nuclear weapons?” Another popular question was, “Do you think South Korea should develop nuclear weapons to counter North Korea’s nuclear weapon developments?” But outside of this one query, there were usually no further questions for the respondent on the motivations or reasoning behind the expressed opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, while a snapshot of the polls gives the impression of hearty South Korean support for nuclearization, a longitudinal look across the entire set of polls suggests otherwise. As Table 1 shows, the average positive response to a question about South Korea’s nuclearization from January 2010 to August 2017 was 59 percent. This increased by only two points on average across polls after September 2017, the year of North Korea’s sixth and latest nuclear test. While this is a net increase (and is not an insubstantial number in itself ), it is not nearly as dramatic as a cross-sectional view that shows some 76 percent supporting nuclearization. None of the existing opinion polls noted this qualification in their findings, but it is an important one because it shows there has not been a dramatic spike in South Korean public enthusiasm for the nuclear option. Instead, there has been an incremental increase — which is understandable given the changing security environment and alliance uncertainties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strategic-elite-polling-results&quot;&gt;Strategic Elite Polling Results&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first U.S. multi-question polling of strategic elites in South Korea on the nuclear question. Strategic elites identified for this online survey numbered 1,094; there was a 16 percent response rate, for a final sample size of 175 respondents. The sample included academics, think tank experts, business elites, legislators, and officials (current and former). The survey was conducted online as a Google Forms and sent to South Korean nationals who are strategic elites residing in South Korea, the United States, Japan, and Europe. The survey sample ranged from junior to senior professionals. Each respondent was asked an initial question about their supportiveness for South Korea going nuclear. Based on the initial answer, respondents were directed to a separate set of questions to gain greater fidelity on their reasoning and their preferences. The survey was in the field for two months ( January to March 2024). The survey answers were anonymized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One would expect elites to have a different view of South Korea’s security environment than the public. In general, they have a better understanding of the threat matrix, conventional South Korean military capabilities, and North Korean nuclear capabilities. This group is also more likely to understand the costs and benefits of South Korea crossing the nuclear weapons threshold. Finally, they should have a more nuanced understanding of the U.S. alliance and its extended deterrence guarantees to South Korea. These factors combine into the expectation that opinions among the strategic elite on nuclearization would be less enthusiastic than those of the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;finding-1-the-vast-majority-of-south-korean-strategic-elites-do-not-favor-nuclearization&quot;&gt;Finding 1: The vast majority of South Korean strategic elites do not favor nuclearization.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to the statement “South Korea should acquire nuclear weapons,” 34 percent of strategic elites answered positively, 53 percent answered negatively, and 13 percent answered, “I am not sure.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirty-four percent support represents a much lower level of elite support than that of the general public, which averages at 61 percent based on 36 public opinion polls since September 2017 — and a substantially lower level of support than a recent public poll that puts support as high as 76.6 percent. Strategic elites, whose views matter most in national security decisionmaking, by a wide margin do not favor a nuclear South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, those who do not support nuclearization represent a broad bipartisan base, with 36 percent each self-identifying as either politically conservative/moderate conservative or progressive/moderate progressive and 28 percent identifying as politically moderate. By contrast, those who do support nuclearization predominantly self-identify as conservative (68 percent versus 10 percent identifying as progressive).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;finding-2-south-korean-strategic-elites-see-high-reputational-and-material-costs-to-going-nuclear&quot;&gt;Finding 2: South Korean strategic elites see high reputational and material costs to going nuclear.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When those who replied “no” to the previous question were asked why they do not support a nuclear South Korea, a plurality of respondents (43 percent) ranked the most important reason to be the international sanctions and reputational loss of status that would come with breaking away from the NPT regime. They ranked this reason higher than the potential damage done to the U.S.-South Korea alliance. They also ranked the costs associated with reputational loss and economic sanctions higher than inducing an arms race on the Korean Peninsula and higher than being targeted as strategic threats by other nuclear powers such as China and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps unsurprisingly, those strategic elites who do not support nuclearization believe that nuclear weapons will not provide South Korea with greater security. Nearly 71 percent of strategic elites disagreed with the statement that nuclear weaponization of South Korea would make it “secure and safe from outside threats.” This stands in contrast to ubiquitous North Korean rhetoric that justifies nuclear weapons as the ultimate security provider for the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;finding-3-the-opposition-to-nuclear-weaponization-in-south-korea-changes-dramatically-if-an-america-first-policy-returns-to-the-white-house&quot;&gt;Finding 3: The opposition to nuclear weaponization in South Korea changes dramatically if an “America First” policy returns to the White House.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The negative attitude held by South Korean strategic elites in regard to nuclearization is not unconditional. The CSIS poll asked a hypothetical question as to whether a wavering of the U.S. security commitment to South Korea would change the respondents’ views on the nuclear question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, respondents were asked if abandonment fears regarding the United States, attendant with policies that denigrate allies and call for troop withdrawals, would affect their perspective toward acquiring nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifty-one percent of those who previously did not support a nuclear South Korea said that they would change their minds in such a scenario. In addition, of those respondents who initially supported a nuclear South Korea, 90 percent said their support for nuclearization would increase even further. While the poll did not fully test alternative scenarios, this finding suggests that strategic elites’ views on nuclearization are tied more to confidence in the alliance than to extant security threats. Moreover, it suggests that the return of Donald Trump to the White House and a renewal of decoupling rhetoric or actual policies to withdraw U.S. ground troops from the peninsula could significantly impact the nuclear debate in South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is notable that a substantial body of elite opinion among the “non-nuclear believers” (46 percent) would still assert non-nuclear principles in such a scenario, only 10 percent of those “nuclear believers” said their support for a nuclear South Korea would remain the same or decrease. This suggests strong support for nuclearization among the original “nuclear believer” minority would be supplemented by significantly new supportive voices from the previously “non-nuclear” community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Moreover, it [the finding] suggests that the return of Donald Trump to the White House and a renewal of decoupling rhetoric or actual policies to withdraw U.S. ground troops from the peninsula could significantly impact the nuclear debate in South Korea.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of those strategic elites who agree that South Korea should acquire nuclear weapons, the majority of these (54 percent) prefer an autonomous and independent capability over any nuclear sharing arrangements or the return of U.S. tactical nuclear weapons to the peninsula. Ninety-five percent of these nuclear advocates see the weapons as enhancing South Korea’s external security, and 65 percent of advocates believe the primary purpose of such weapons is to counter North Korea as opposed to China or Russia. A small fraction of respondents (no more than 2 percent) see nuclear weapons acquisition as important for status or prestige.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While supporters of a nuclear South Korea most prefer achieving this goal through an independent capability, most non-supporters, if pressed to choose, prefer a nuclear sharing arrangement within the U.S.-ROK alliance. When asked about the hypothetical question of South Korean nuclearization, the vast majority (71 percent) of non-nuclear strategic elites ranked an independent capability as the least preferred option, while only 1 percent ranked a nuclear sharing arrangement as their least preferred option. A simple majority (61 percent) ranked nuclear sharing as their most preferable choice. In addition, most elites (57 percent) in the noncommittal category of nuclearization (“I am not sure”) also ranked nuclear sharing as preferable to other modes of South Korean nuclearization. This suggests that the majority of South Korean strategic elites, even if forced to rescind their non-nuclear beliefs because of U.S. decoupling, would still seek nuclearization within the context of the alliance and would still potentially see the alliance as a resilient institution from which they could derive security benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;analysis&quot;&gt;Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several possible explanations for why strategic elites hold such different views on nuclearization compared with the general public. First, elites value their country’s global status as a supporter of the rules-based international system, particularly Seoul’s championing of the nonproliferation regime. South Korea is an upstanding member of the NPT and has wholly condemned North Korea’s withdrawal from the treaty. Its 123 Civil Nuclear Agreement with the United States maintains gold-standard nonproliferation safeguards. The 2023 Washington Declaration on the occasion of President Yoon’s state visit reaffirmed South Korea’s commitment to nonproliferation. Elites understand better than the public the consequences that going nuclear would have in terms of tarnishing the nation’s reputation, labeling it a rule breaker, and costing them years of reputational risk and economic sanctions — not unlike North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, elites have a better understanding than the public of the deterrence value of the U.S. alliance for South Korean national security. This applies to both strategic capabilities and will. Elites understand the full range of U.S. strategic capabilities that support the defense of the peninsula as a treaty ally. They also give greater weight to the physical manifestations of those capabilities in the nuclear submarine port calls and strategic bomber visits to the peninsula. Strategic elites also certainly have better insights than the public into nuclear planning by the United States, be this in the context of the alliance or in NATO. In terms of intentions, elites recognize the importance of words as policy, particularly at the summit level, and better appreciate recent U.S. efforts to bolster deterrence by reiterating U.S. nuclear guarantees in Biden’s speeches and in official documents such as the Washington Declaration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But South Korean elite confidence in the alliance’s security guarantees is not gifted to Washington, it is earned. If decoupling actions are undertaken by future U.S. administrations, these elites have the capacity to adjust their views and take alternative actions as needed, even if these actions might impinge on core values and beliefs. It is noteworthy that the non-nuclear believers who responded that their approval of nuclearization would increase in response to U.S. retrenchment represent the full political spectrum in Korea. Thirty-six percent of this group self-identified as conservative/moderate conservative, 28 percent as moderate, and 36 percent as progressive/moderate progressive. The upshot is that the groundswell of support for nuclearization would not be a polarizing political issue in South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The public discussion of nuclear options for South Korea has revolved around whether to consider autonomous nuclear capabilities, or if the country should instead encourage the return of U.S. tactical nuclear weapons to the Korean Peninsula. The option of nuclear sharing has usually been at the margins of discussion. But the present survey shows that when the majority of elites choose nuclearization, the debate will be between whether to pursue an autonomous capability (the preferred choice of “nuclear believers”) or nuclear sharing arrangements (the preferred choice of “non-nuclear believers”). The survey shows that the least preferred option for a nuclear path is the return of U.S. tactical nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In terms of intentions, elites recognize the importance of words as policy, . . . better appreciate recent U.S. efforts to bolster deterrence by reiterating U.S. nuclear guarantees in Biden’s speeches and in official documents such as the Washington Declaration.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will still be a demand signal from a nuclear South Korea for the alliance with the United States. The fact that a majority of respondents (both nuclear believers and non-nuclear believers) prefer nuclear sharing as South Korea’s nuclear option suggests that South Koreans, even if forced to go nuclear in response to fears of U.S. abandonment, would want to do this through the alliance with a sharing arrangement (rather than acquiring autonomous capabilities).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survey results show that the primary rationale for a nuclear option is security, not status, and that the security threat is defined exclusively as North Korea. This suggests two positive implications. First, South Korean strategic elites do not see nuclear weapons as necessary to counter China, Russia, or Japan. Second, absent a North Korean nuclear threat, South Korean need for nuclear weapons would be minimized, at least in the minds of strategic elites (all else held equal).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the survey results show a degree of partisanship on the nuclear issue. The vast majority of those respondents who support nuclearization self-identified as conservative or moderately conservative (68 percent), while only a small minority self-identified as progressive or moderately progressive (10 percent). However, it is notable that the 66 percent who do not agree with South Korea’s nuclearization tend to be bipartisan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-for-policy&quot;&gt;Recommendations for Policy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t press the panic button yet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policymakers and alliance managers do not have to be concerned that South Korea is on the verge of a nuclear breakout. The bottom line is that South Korean elites do not want to go nuclear and still have confidence in the alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continue to reassure.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least for the time being, the continued development of extended deterrence mechanisms such as the Nuclear Consultative Group, integrated early-warning systems, strategic asset visits to the Korean Peninsula, streamlined intelligence sharing, and other measures serve the alliance well. Trilateralizing extended deterrence discussions with Tokyo offers another venue for reassurance. Reassurance can sometimes be a bottomless pit, but this is a small price to pay to avoid nuclearization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid retrenchment and decoupling rhetoric.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Confidence in the alliance is the key determinant of South Korean nuclear attitudes, even more so than external threats posed by North Korea, China, or Russia. If preventing further proliferation on the peninsula is a U.S. policy goal, this would be well served by avoiding rhetoric and action that suggest U.S. decoupling from its ally, even as trade disputes or cost-sharing disputes might negatively impact relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be mindful of the undecided views.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Messaging about the alliance should consider not only the nuclear believers and non-nuclear believers but also the undecided population. This is a not-insignificant group, according to the present survey (13 percent), that could tip the balance in any national debate on going nuclear. Moreover, there remains almost 50 percent of non-nuclear believers who responded that they would still not seek nuclearization if the United States disengaged from the Korean Peninsula. This core non-nuclear respondent group also represents a broad political base, with about one-third each self-identifying as conservative, moderate, or progressive. For nonproliferation purposes, this group’s voice should be amplified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public opinion still matters.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elites, while influential, do not always get what they want in foreign policy, especially in today’s environment of hyper-politicization of issues and misinformed narratives. Careful alliance messaging should avoid decoupling talk and bolster the persuasiveness of the “non-nuclear” camp. Otherwise, once these elites are forced to opt for nuclearization, the public will support them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Invest in South Korea’s nonproliferation bona fides.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should help facilitate a larger global role for South Korea in nuclear security and safety, including a role in a second generation of nuclear security summits; a Korean director-general for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA); bilateral cooperation in civil nuclear energy and gold-standard safety and security; and a South Korean convening role in a Seoul-based Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) secretariat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（26日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第67日審訊。陳梓華繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供，並接受辯方盤問。辯方指在數次陳與黎的會面當中，黎沒有說過想「領導或主導勇武派」，或是結合議會、街頭和國際的力量，去「推爆個政府」。陳早前供稱，他於2020年1月在台北陽明山的別墅與黎智英、「攬炒巴」劉祖廸等人開會，期間黎聲稱想培養劉成為政治明星，並談及「支爆」計劃。不過辯方今指，「支爆」是由劉祖廸在會議中首先提出，而非黎智英，而黎對這種字眼並不熟悉，會議更沒有談論如何達到「支爆」。惟陳稱：「我唔同意。」辯方又指，黎想培養劉祖廸成為政治明星、提供一萬英鎊生活費的說法，完全是陳捏造出來的。陳否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已認罪的被告陳梓華第九天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。由代表黎智英的紐西蘭御用大律師 Marc Corlett 盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指黎智英僅在意大規模遊行畫面要和平-其他小打小鬧示威則沒有立場&quot;&gt;陳梓華指黎智英僅在意大規模遊行畫面要和平 其他「小打小鬧」示威則沒有立場&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就陳梓華與黎智英第一次親身會面，辯方指陳早前供稱黎認為示威應該和平、非暴力，以爭取國際支持，亦表示希望透過陳聯絡勇武派，叫他們克制，因為他們的行動會危害國際支持，陳以「淨化計劃」來形容黎的計劃，但是這只是陳自己的理解，可是黎智英從來沒有使用「淨化計劃」這個字眼。惟陳不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎曾說過勇武派襲擊警察和破壞財物會有反作用，提倡港獨的人士會削弱香港民主運動，他希望所有示威都是和平、非暴力。惟陳稱：「佢（黎）冇講過所有嘅示威都想和平、非暴力」，又稱：「佢唔係咁樣講。佢係話『美國唔希望見到咁樣嘅畫面』」，如果有傳媒報導的畫面，就應該是「和理非」的，「至於唔會咁多畫面畀人見到嗰啲，其實佢冇立場嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，黎智英是想傳媒選擇性報導？陳則回答不是，當時傳媒主要報導兩次大型遊行，但同時間在不同地方「有啲小打小鬧嘅示威」，「當時佢（黎）在意嘅係，呢啲比較規模大嘅示威一定要係個畫面和平嘅，唔應該有太多暴力場面。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華認是勇武派telegram-群組成員之一-但否認身為勇武派一員&quot;&gt;陳梓華認是勇武派Telegram 群組成員之一 但否認身為勇武派一員&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎智英要求陳梓華傳遞訊息，是因為陳與勇武派有接觸。陳表示：「我同意。」辯方追問，陳是否勇武派的領袖。陳否認。辯方又問，陳是否勇武派成員之一。陳則稱：「我唔會咁形容。」辯方追問那陳會如何形容自己。陳稱：「我哋只係喺同一個群組入面。」陳亦確認他並沒有參與在暴力示威行動中，他的角色只是身為勇武派的 Telegram 群組成員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，在該次飯局中，要求收起陳手提電話的人是李柱銘，黎並沒有說過他與私人助手 Mark Simon 每天都會聯絡，黎也沒有說過「年青人做唔到嘅嘢，利用佢傳媒嘅力量，就可以做到」。惟陳不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指黎智英沒說過想領導或主導勇武派&quot;&gt;辯方指黎智英沒說過想「領導或主導勇武派」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華與黎智英於2019年11月13日第二次親身見面，當時是在黎的住所，同場有民主黨的林卓廷、李永達和工黨的李卓人。辯方指，黎在該次飯局中，曾說過對於馬鞍山火燒人事後感到震驚，形容勇武派「冇分寸、冇組織、愈來愈暴力」，如果有人在運動中死亡的話，香港便會失去國際支持，民主運動亦會失去道德高地，削弱原有的進程。陳確認，又指黎說過勇武派要減少激進行動，應該以「和理非」抗爭為主旨。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，陳當時有在席間表明同意黎的觀點，並說黎的觀點「一語中的（hit the nail on the head）」。惟陳稱：「我冇講過。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指，黎智英沒有特別提及過「五大訴求」，也沒有說過「如果年青人做唔到嘅嘢，佢可以以傳媒嘅力量做到」。陳不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳早前供稱黎想「領導或主導勇武派」，辯方則指這僅僅是陳自己的理解，黎並沒有在飯局中表示想「領導或主導勇武派」，而黎所說的是要求陳聯絡勇武派，叫他們停止使用暴力。陳不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方聞言質疑，陳的意思是否指黎想出去參與暴力示威、進行暴力行動？惟陳亦表示：「唔係。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指黎智英沒說過結合議會街頭和國際力量推爆個政府&quot;&gt;辯方指黎智英沒說過結合議會、街頭和國際力量「推爆個政府」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就陳梓華和黎智英第三次會面，是在2019年11月27日在黎的座駕上，辯方指黎當時仍然想聯絡勇武派，而並非如陳早前所供稱黎已經「大致掌握勇武派嘅資料同動向」，所以不需陳繼續協助。陳不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳早前供稱黎該次說過區議會民主派大勝，應該乘著這股氣勢，結合議會、街頭和國際的力量，去「推爆個政府」。辯方向陳提議，黎智英並沒有說過上述說話。惟陳不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳早前亦供稱黎提到張崑陽，並談及商討贊助和眾籌的事宜。辯方則指黎並沒有在該次會面中談及商討贊助和眾籌。惟陳表示：「我唔同意，佢有講過。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，在該次會面中，黎和陳並沒有達成協議去做任何非法事情。惟陳表示：「呢個我唔確定」，因黎講得好清楚要議會、街頭和國際線結合，「而我好難認為，當時國際線或者街頭，所有嘢都係合法嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指黎智英沒有向陳梓華談及初選&quot;&gt;辯方指黎智英沒有向陳梓華談及初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳早前供稱，在2019年12月31日與黎智英第四次會面，當時同樣在一架停泊在金鐘的座駕上單獨會面。辯方指，黎在會面中表明反對港獨和攬炒，惟陳只同意黎有講過反對港獨，至於攬炒方面則不同意，因黎有叫陳聯絡「攬炒巴」劉祖廸。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，黎所說的是他認為不應該在國際論壇上提及港獨和攬炒，而且應該給予年輕人多些指引，然而陳對於黎的印象是他不理解為何年輕人會「無大台」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳早前亦供稱，黎認為如果政治素人參與初選之後落敗的話，他們的票都可以「流返落老泛民度」，最終可以鞏固到泛民在立法會的議席。辯方則指黎並沒有在該次會面中談及初選。陳不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方稱台北會面是為了與勇武派領袖見面&quot;&gt;辯方稱台北會面是為了與勇武派領袖見面&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就2020年1月的台北陽明山別墅的會議，辯方指黎智英曾經告訴陳梓華，會面源起是黎想與勇武派的領袖見面，籲他們停止做不恰當行為，這亦是「攬炒巴」劉祖廸前來台灣參與會議的原因。惟陳不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，在整個會面過程中，劉祖廸僅以「攬炒」作為自己的稱呼，當黎智英問及劉的英文名時，劉並沒有提供。陳確認。辯方指劉祖廸在會議中鮮有發言，主要是黎智英和陳梓華發言。陳則不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指黎智英僅叫劉祖廸做年輕人領袖-而非說培養他做政治明星&quot;&gt;辯方指黎智英僅叫劉祖廸做年輕人領袖 而非說培養他做政治明星&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問陳是否記得，黎在會議中提及過「香港監察」及其創辦人羅傑斯（Benedict Rogers），也就香港年輕人的活動表達關注，指圍封理大事件中有四成勇武派被捕。陳表示沒有印象，但他確認黎關注年輕人沒有領袖和方向。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，黎智英說過，勇武派是時候有一個領袖。惟陳稱：「佢唔係咁講。」辯方再指黎說過他認為年輕人要有適當的領導。陳則確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳早前供稱黎在會議中表示要培養劉祖廸做政治明星，惟辯方指，黎並沒有如此說過，黎只是說劉可以做年輕人的領袖；又指陳供稱黎說提供一萬英鎊生活費給劉祖廸，完全是陳捏造出來的。陳否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指支爆乃由劉祖廸首先提出-黎智英對此字眼並不熟悉&quot;&gt;辯方指「支爆」乃由劉祖廸首先提出 黎智英對此字眼並不熟悉&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指，「支爆」是由劉祖廸在會議中首先提出，而非黎智英，而黎對這種字眼並不熟悉。陳稱：「我唔同意。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎沒有說過任何關於國際游說、實施制裁和禁運的話題，會議也沒有提及李宇軒到訪美國會見議員。辯方亦指，黎智英沒有提及眾籌、前美國眾議院議長佩洛西或前政務司司長陳方安生，會議也沒有提及劉祖廸和「攬炒團隊」的工作，沒有談論如何達到「支爆」。陳對以上說法一概否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳早前供稱劉祖廸在會議中表示願意合作，但需要與李宇軒商討，惟辯方指劉的意思是有關年輕人的工作，而非關於國際游說，而且整個會議中從沒有提起過李宇軒。陳不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指陳梓華的訊息沒有提及制裁-陳點會喺whatsapp度講我自己做犯法嘅嘢&quot;&gt;辯方指陳梓華的訊息沒有提及制裁 陳：點會喺WhatsApp度講我自己做犯法嘅嘢？&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年5月21日，黎智英向陳梓華傳送人大公布實施「港版國安法」的新聞，陳之後回覆：「黎前輩：事情至今，已經難以逆轉形勢，我唯一擔心是你與 Martin 及你們家人的自身安全，萬事請以自身安全與事業存續為首要考慮。國安法主要針對境外內勇武人士，港獨份子及煽惑群眾人士。你務必謹慎。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，陳並沒有在上述訊息提及向外國請求制裁。陳回應：「因為我知道犯咗法，所以我仲點會喺 WhatsApp 度講我自己做犯法嘅嘢？」他其後又補上一句：「我呢句已經講得好溫和架喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問陳為何會向黎傳送上述訊息，叫他小心。陳則稱：「因為有好多人講過，《國安法》立嚟就係針對黎智英。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同日，黎智英回覆陳，籲他不要擔心個人安危，一旦站出來爭取自由，便要作戰至最後一刻，雖然未必會勝利，但必須堅持下去，更好的日子即將會來臨。（“Let’s not worry about personal security. Once came out to join the fight for freedom one is prepared to fight to the last. We may not win but must persist. Don’t worry. Better days will come.”）辯方問陳，黎訊息的意思是否鼓勵他保持士氣，繼續參與民主運動。陳則回答這是其中一個意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華其後回覆黎，稱自己無路可退，他有責任盡量保留實力，也不會放棄，「如果你們倒下了，我會是最後一個站著的人」，最好的情況即將來臨。（“There is no turning back for me and I do have a sense of duty to conserve our forces as much as possible. I won’t give up too. If all of you fall, I will be the last man standing. The best is yet to come.”）辯方問陳，上述訊息是否反映陳看待自己的方式。陳表示：「我有咁嘅諗法。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指黎智英沒有在壹傳媒大樓會面中談及ipac或swhk&quot;&gt;辯方指黎智英沒有在壹傳媒大樓會面中談及IPAC或SWHK&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳早前供稱於2020年6月16日到達將軍澳壹傳媒大樓，與黎智英第六次會面，指期間黎提及「《國安法》雷聲大、雨點小，佢唔會有事嘅」。辯方質疑，黎當時並未看過《國安法》條文，也不會知道條文內容，黎亦未曾告訴陳，他知道《國安法》之下國際游說變成不合法。陳同意，可是他認為當時黎予人感覺是他已事先知道《國安法》條文內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎並沒有在該次會面中談論「對華政策跨國議會聯盟」（Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China，簡稱 IPAC），也沒有談論「重光團隊」（Fight for Freedom, Stand with Hong Kong，簡稱 SWHK）；黎亦沒有提及過要為《蘋果日報》尋求經濟或商業支援。惟陳一概表示不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/buBUuy5.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（26日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第67日審訊。陳梓華繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供，並接受辯方盤問。辯方展示陳於2020年10月11日在警署錄影會面謄本，顯示他當時跟警方否認是「重光團隊」（SWHK）成員，又稱不肯定李宇軒是否成員之一、與 SWHK 沒有任何關係、會講 SWHK 的負面評價等等。陳在庭上逐一承認當時的說法是虛假的。他亦承認：「我當時係想畀警察覺得唔關李宇軒事」，為了令李脫罪而向警方捏造供詞，又承認：「當時想同 Stand with Hong Kong 撇清關係。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已認罪的被告陳梓華第九天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。由代表黎智英的紐西蘭御用大律師 Marc Corlett 盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華錄口供稱對李宇軒所知不多-惟今庭上改稱不是真話&quot;&gt;陳梓華錄口供稱對李宇軒所知不多 惟今庭上改稱不是真話&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方談及陳梓華與李宇軒之間的關係，二人於2019年6月在網上認識，當時聯絡是有關 Telegram 的G20登報計劃群組面對眾籌問題。之後二人曾經數次親身見面，惟《國安法》生效之後，二人便沒有再親身見面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，事實上陳梓華對李宇軒所知不多，例如不知道李的職業、學歷、個人背景和住在哪裡等等。陳否認，並堅稱：「我知，我知佢住邊。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方遂向陳出示2020年10月11日的錄影會面謄本，當時陳首次被捕，尚未同意以證人身份協助本案。陳當時向警方稱：「我同佢（李）嘅私交嘅關係，係在於我會詢問到佢，了解到佢屋企人之間嘅關係，但係佢嘅職業、佢嘅學歷、佢嘅背景，我係唔清楚，亦都唔了解嘅。」陳稱他當時的確這樣跟警察說。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;但當辯方追問陳當時有否向警方說真話時，陳卻稱：「當時我冇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華錄口供稱對李宇軒所知不多二人關係不平等-今庭上稱是虛假&quot;&gt;陳梓華錄口供稱對李宇軒所知不多、二人關係不平等 今庭上稱是虛假&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳的錄影會面謄本亦顯示，陳當時向警方稱：「我有問心嗰句嘅，我對於我與佢嘅關係唔平等嘅，唔平等嘅關係就在於佢對我認知好多，佢會知我住邊度，但我從來唔知道佢住邊度，佢會知道我嘅職業係乜嘢，但我從來唔知佢職業係乜嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳表示，當時他的確不知道李宇軒住哪裡。辯方追問，所以陳是否對李所知不多。陳則表示，相比起李所知道他的事，他的確對李所知較少。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，陳聲稱二人關係不平等，因為李對陳認知很多，但是陳卻對李所知不多。陳說：「當時我唔係咁諗。」辯方追問這說法是否真確。陳則表示：「假嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在辯方盤問下，陳確認李會參與民主運動，但是不會知道當中所有的活動；陳也同意他與李宇軒一樣都是參與民主運動的年青一代。辯方遂問陳，與其說他與李是親密朋友（close friends），不如說二人是擁有共同利益的泛泛之交（acquaintances with common interest），這樣的說法是否公允。陳則回應：「我唔知佢點諗，但我當佢係朋友。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華錄口供稱不肯定李宇軒是否swhk成員-今庭上承認是虛假陳述&quot;&gt;陳梓華錄口供稱不肯定李宇軒是否SWHK成員 今庭上承認是虛假陳述&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「重光團隊」（Fight for Freedom, Stand with Hong Kong，簡稱 SWHK），陳確認它是一個鬆散的組織，曾經有一段時間出現不同人以 SWHK 名義做不同事情的情況。陳稱在 SWHK 初期成立的時候，他不是成員之一，後來在大約2020年6至7月，他加入了 SWHK 的群組。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方遂展示陳的錄影會面謄本，當時警察問他是否 SWHK 的成員，陳回答：「絕對唔係。」辯方追問陳當時的說法是真實還是虛假。陳回答：「假嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;錄影會面謄本亦顯示，警察繼而問李宇軒是否 SWHK 成員，陳當時回應：「佢本人是否呢個組織嘅成員，我自己係難以去界定」，又指李有參與做義工，但不知道他是否實際上恆常參與 SWHK 的其中一人。辯方指，事實上陳在當時並不知道李是否 SWHK 的成員之一。陳不同意，並堅稱他知道李是SWHK成員。辯方追問，陳跟警察所說的東西是真實還是虛假。陳回答：「假。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華承認為了幫李宇軒脫罪而向警察說謊&quot;&gt;陳梓華承認為了幫李宇軒脫罪而向警察說謊&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指陳並不知道誰人是 SWHK 的領袖，也與領袖沒有任何關係。陳表示：「我唔同意。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方遂展示陳的錄影會面謄本，顯示陳當時向警方聲稱進入不到 SWHK 的核心，所以與 SWHK 的領袖沒有關係。辯方追問陳上述陳述是真實還是虛假。陳回答：「假。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;錄影會面謄本亦顯示，陳向警察稱 SWHK 領導「唔似係得李宇軒一個」，辯方指陳的意思是他並不知道 SWHK 的領導，除了李之外。陳回應：「我當時係想畀警察覺得唔關李宇軒事。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，陳當時是否嘗試令李宇軒脫罪。陳回答：「10月嘅時候，係。」辯方問陳，是否為了幫李宇軒脫罪而向警方捏造供詞。陳回答：「係。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱會跟朋友及家人講swhk負面評價-庭上承認說謊想撇清關係&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱會跟朋友及家人講SWHK負面評價 庭上承認說謊：想撇清關係&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，陳梓華並不知道 SWHK 的背景，亦會向朋友和家人講對於 SWHK 的負面評價，陳否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方向陳展示其錄影會面謄本，顯示他當時向警察稱：「因為我對於 Stand with Hong Kong 嘅某啲目的，甚或乎背景，我一直有存疑。咁可能我會有所貶抑，對佢哋一啲負面嘅評論，可能會喺私底下同朋友上面，或者係同家人有講過。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問上述說法是真實還是虛假，惟陳回應：「當時想同 Stand with Hong Kong 撇清關係。」辯方追問：「所以你向警察說謊？」陳稱：「我同意。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華錄口供稱沒參與國際游說-庭上承認是虛假說法&quot;&gt;陳梓華錄口供稱沒參與國際游說 庭上承認是虛假說法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在盤問下，陳表示他並非沒有參與過國際游說。至於陳在2020年10月11日錄影會面中聲稱沒有參與其中，他今在庭上改口說：「當時係假嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又確認，他沒有參與過 IPAC 的工作、沒有參與 SWHK 的日本線、英國線和北歐線，也沒有代表 SWHK 草擬或發布新聞稿、Facebook 或 Twitter 帖文。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於 SWHK 的美國線，陳稱在《國安法》生效之後，他有參與 Telegram 群組的會議，及參與討論，當大家一起決策的時候，他有表示同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下周一（4月29日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What links a former US president and recently anointed Republican candidate for the 2024 presidential election and an obscure newspaper from the small, bucolic town of Totnes in the West of England? The surprising answer is the development of government-backed cryptocurrencies, commonly known as Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) – or more precisely, a conspiratorial suspicion of what their development and introduction might herald. Throw in the views of leading US political voices such as Ron DeSantis and Ted Cruz, UK chancer-in-chief Nigel Farage, a former BBC sports pundit, the brother of a former UK Labour Party leader and European entrepreneur Kim Dotcom, and the development of CBDCs faces some vocal and influential headwinds. But why is this? Why has the grey and technical world of central banking become a magnet for conspiracy theorists? In this article, based on a review of literature and dives down various rabbit holes, we will first assess the various forms of opposition to CBDCs – ranging from the genuine to the self-serving, alarmist and fantastical. We will then consider how the conspiracy theorists propose addressing their concerns could be addressed, before concluding with what those that are developing CBDCs might say in response – if they are to be believed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;central-bank-digital-worries&quot;&gt;Central Bank Digital Worries?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conspiracies confronting the development of CBDCs by central bankers fall into a range of increasingly extreme categories – from those rooted in potentially realistic concerns, to those that are highly dystopian and removed from reality. Despite this spectrum of opinion, these conspiracy theories share some common ground, central to which is the fear of losing privacy, freedom and individual autonomy. Such fears in turn span a range of perspectives reaching as far as a belief that CBDCs are part of a desire to enforce the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) “Great Reset” (an unfortunate and conspiracy-inspiring choice of name by the WEF) and to support the capitalist and elite takeover of global governance. To get a better understanding of this array of conspiracies, it is helpful to consider them in three different categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-seemingly-concerned-activists&quot;&gt;The Seemingly Concerned Activists&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This group is deeply worried about the potential effects of CBDCs on their lives and draws inspiration for action from CBDC conspiracy theories. These initiatives start with simple steps, like producing graffiti to warn people of the dangers of digital currencies or staging demonstrations opposite Downing Street in London, as they seek to raise awareness of the perceived risks of CBDCs in an entirely non-digital and accessible manner. They have no particular personal goal in taking such actions beyond expressing their resistance to these new financial developments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hwTfvQL.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/dVbdnIu.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The potential for CBDCs to control how a user spends their money is a central concern of many who oppose their development. This can be seen, for example, in a petition published on the UK Parallel Parliament website, which closed in April 2023. The petition directly focused on this fear of control, by objecting to the inclusion of any sort of programmable aspect in a UK CBDC that might grant the Bank of England control of use. Over 31,000 signatures were added to the petition, underlining a core and widely held concern that CBDCs might be used to impose limitations on how individuals can spend their money in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joining these concerned members of the general public and their fears of the loss of privacy and control can be found US political voices such as Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, as well as Ted Cruz, the Senator for Texas, who rank among others who have already introduced – or plan to introduce – legislation against CBDCs in their states in order to address these perceived concerns. Of course, nothing is always as it appears in the world of conspiracies, and thus these seemingly passionately held views must be considered alongside their proponents’ support for and close cooperation with groups such as the Blockchain Association or the American Bankers Association. Are their concerns real, or might they be based on more mundane commercial considerations? Similar questions arise with vocal opponents such as social media influencer and Bitcoin booster Layah Heilpern – who receives her entire income in Bitcoin – who declared that “Central Bank Digital Currencies will strip you of all your freedoms. When you don’t have freedom of money you don’t have freedom of anything”. The same applies to Tulsi Gabbard, a US politician, Army Reserve officer and political commentator, who used her speech at the Bitcoin 2023 conference in Miami to spread concerns about CBDCs and simultaneously promote the significance of Bitcoin. Ultimately, this category of conspiracy theorist seems mainly concerned with sowing distrust in CBDCs as a means of maintaining the financial system’s status quo – something they may, perhaps, benefit from themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-political-rabble-rousers&quot;&gt;The Political Rabble-Rousers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This category mainly encompasses US and European politicians, and other high-profile opinion-formers, who – whether they believe them or not – tap into CBDC conspiracy theories to skilfully engage their bases. What their genuine beliefs are, or from where they source their knowledge, is often unknown, but this does not matter since their audience is often not directly interested in evidence but rather in voices that confirm their personal views and opinions. Feeding the conspiracy theories held by their supporters can be a valuable tool to garner greater attention, make more sales of merchandise, or – in the case of politicians – get more votes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most prominent person to use this approach is former US President Donald Trump, who promised in a presidential campaign speech in New Hampshire in January 2024 to “protect Americans from government tyranny”. In his speech, Trump portrayed CBDCs as a threat to freedom, claiming that the federal government would have “absolute control over your money” – meaning that it “could take your money and you wouldn’t even know it’s gone”. Attempting to make this a partisan issue, Trump said: “You know what ‘they’ are doing”. However, like others that have taken a vocal stance against CBDCs, it is notable that Trump reportedly owns around $3 million in cryptocurrencies and has promoted the trading of non-fungible tokens (a form of online digital collectable) trading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump has not been alone in using CBDC conspiracies in political campaigning. Indeed, it is most likely an idea he co-opted from entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, an early challenger for the Republican presidential candidacy, who claimed that he had explained the dangers of CBDCs for the country’s liberty to Trump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stoking fears of government control via CBDCs is not exclusive to Republican Party presidential candidates, either. Independent campaigner Robert F Kennedy Jr has likewise expressed his concern regarding a digital dollar and is worried about the possibility of governmental surveillance and control, citing the example of China’s CBDC and its alleged connection to the country’s social credit system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;As with other forms of mis- and disinformation, social media platforms like X serve as a catalyst for further interpretation and amplification of CBDC conspiracy theories&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crossing the Atlantic, similar concerns have been expressed by British broadcaster and former politician Nigel Farage and by Dutch Member of the European Parliament Marcel de Graff. Farage has claimed that “Central Bank Digital Currencies will give the state total control over our lives. This must be resisted”, while de Graff has similarly argued that “If you don’t comply with the totalitarian regime, it will have your bank accounts closed. CBDC will make it even easier”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarise, members of this group mostly worry about governmental control and surveillance, and use their platforms to stoke anti-government sentiment by raising concerns about loss of control over the use of personal money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-dystopians&quot;&gt;The Dystopians&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the previous categories consist of individuals who may be harnessing CBDC conspiracy theories for a variety of personal gains, this final category goes beyond mere issues of government control and includes a diverse array of boosters including publications such as The Light and 21st Century Wire and people like former footballer and BBC sports reporter David Icke and the German/Finish internet entrepreneur Kim Dotcom. For example, Icke has argued that “I could see that the plan was in this great reset… to introduce a digital currency controlled by the system so that they can just take what they want”, while 21st Century Wire even goes as far as to claim that “Time is running out. No, you didn’t vote for it, nor were you consulted about it. And yet, it might be the most fundamental power grab by global elites in the history of modern civilization”. As can be seen, what mainly differentiates this group from the others is their highly dystopian view of CBDCs, seeing government-controlled digital currencies as part of a greater plan by global elites, such as the WEF’s “Great Reset” or the UN’s Agenda 2030, the latter of which allegedly uses the Sustainable Development Goals not to promote equality, but as an excuse to eradicate a white and Christian society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their arguments against CBDCs are wrapped up in a broader conspiracy narrative that sees corporations and elites designing programmes – including Covid-19 vaccines – as a means of enslaving humanity and securing absolute control over citizens, even going as far as to compare them to weapons of mass destruction. They argue that the financial system of the West has been proven unsuitable and reached its limits, and thus central bankers have had to create an alternative system that supports a global totalitarian movement to control people. These beliefs are based primarily on the interpretation of official statements by central banks and politicians, as well as the books of Klaus Schwab, chairman of the WEF. Naturally, objective evidence to prove their claims is entirely absent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with other forms of mis- and disinformation, social media platforms like X serve as a catalyst for further interpretation and amplification of these theories. For example, on examining one of Kim Dotcom’s posts about the Great Reset, one can quickly see in the comments section or through the 6,900 retweets how opinions are intensified, further interpreted and spread; the same happens again with comments and reposts, leading to a self-reinforcing cycle of spreading conspiracies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What differentiates this final group from the others is that their fear surpasses the mere concern of potential governmental influence and loss of control over the use of money. This group fears the development of a dystopian world of which CBDCs are just one symptom – a world which, in the view of Kim Dotcom, is a created hell, and where – in the words of The Light – “[…] we will, in effect, be slaves”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-are-conspiracy-theorists-proposing-should-be-done&quot;&gt;What are Conspiracy Theorists Proposing Should be Done?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what are the conspiracy theorists in these three categories proposing to do against the introduction of these “dangerous” digital currencies?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like their range of fears, the conspiracists have a variety of different approaches in mind. Piers Corbyn, a British weather forecaster and former politician, proposes a simple solution: pay in cash if you want to avoid the perceived controlling threat of electronic money – something he practiced himself when he refused to pay by card in a cashless supermarket, forcing a staff member to take his coins as payment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This refusal can be seen as a first step in the revolution against the digitalisation of money, even if it is merely to reject the use of widely adopted and accepted card payments. The importance of cash, its continued existence, and its use as a daily monetary – and anonymous – transactional means are significant elements that run through all proposed opposition to CBDCs. Using physical money is the most logical way to avoid succumbing to the introduction of CBDCs and the simplest form of resistance, particularly as most governments have committed to continuing to provide for and service those that prefer physical cash over electronic payments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this reason, The Light proposes only ever using bank cards to withdraw cash from ATMs, and not to use them as a form of payment. Payment apps also face opposition from The Light, as they are seen as already collecting too much data and constituting the thin end of a wedge of incremental government financial surveillance, with the publication claiming that central bankers might argue that “It’s because everyone uses apps and cards anyway, [that] this is the logical next step”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Around 24% of the UK population would take direct action in the form of protests or rallies against the introduction of a digital pound&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as taking individual action, opponents of CBDCs – regardless of their motivations – promote the importance of spreading the message of resistance and sharing these concerns with networks, friends and family. Social media is thus integral to the “resistance” movement and the dissemination of anti-CBDC propaganda. The irony behind this is that by accepting platforms’ terms and conditions and downloading their apps, people already give away vast amounts of their personal data, providing insights into their activities that can be sold and used to profile users’ interests in just the same way that the users fear central bankers might do with their CBDCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also more proactive proposals for resistance against the introduction of CBDCs. A study by King’s College London shows that around 24% of the UK population would take direct action in the form of protests or rallies against the introduction of a digital pound, and 15% of these people even say violence in such protests would be acceptable. Only a few of these people are direct readers of conspiracy theory-spreading newspapers, with most gathering their information from social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another robust proposal – which in the case of some US states is already a reality – is the creation of legislation against the introduction of CBDCs. Donald Trump and Robert F Kennedy Jr have both used such an approach in their presidential campaigns. Trump said: “As your president, I will never allow the creation of a central bank digital currency”. Ron DeSantis, Florida’s governor, already went a step further: he successfully introduced Senate Bill 7054, which prohibits the use of CBDCs, at least in Florida. For this act, he was supported by most officials of the state of Florida, who all see CBDCs as an attempt by the Biden administration to increase governmental control and to secure the possibility of using it as a weapon against the US people. In their view, the introduction of legislation is the only way to protect Florida’s citizens from overreach by the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-might-the-grey-suits-respond&quot;&gt;How Might the Grey Suits Respond?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Switching perspectives, what do central banks and other financial operators have to say about all these accusations and dystopian visions of the future? Central bankers indeed understand that the introduction and idea of CBDCs might rattle people, and that they are worried about governmental surveillance. However, awareness of the population’s concerns does not necessarily make life easier for central banks, because every word can be misinterpreted and used against them, as we have seen in the previous sections. Evelien Witlox, the programme manager for the digital euro at the European Central Bank, said that “These are people of our society, and we would like to take their concerns away – the problem is how we can do that”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mithra Sundberg, the head of the Swedish central bank’s CBDC project, has argued that “Neither the state nor the central bank have any interest in looking at how people pay for things”, and that “Privacy is an extremely important question when you’re talking about all types of digital monies”. The Bank of England has likewise clarified that “A digital pound would have the same (or stronger) privacy protections as bank accounts, debit cards or cheques” and that “[an] individual’s personal details would not be known by the Government or the Bank of England”. In response to the petition of the UK Parallel Parliament about the programmable aspects of CBDCs, the UK government stated that “Neither the Bank of England nor the government would be able to programme CBDC or restrict how money is spent. If there was end-user demand for programmability features, then any programmability features would be designed by the private sector wallets, and users would have the option to use them if they so wished”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concern that digital currencies will become the only possible payment method and that there will no longer be any other payment options is also a point that several of the world’s central banks are trying to address. For example, in a joint report published by the Bank for International Settlements, it is argued that “any CBDC ecosystem would involve both the public and private sector”. The central banks are also supported by the operators that – according to the conspiracies – they want to eradicate; for example, Mark Barnett, the European president of Mastercard, made it clear that he was not concerned that current payment systems would be replaced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, central banks are trying hard to ensure citizens’ trust and emphasise the benefits of CBDCs, such as facilitating the combating of terrorism financing, crime and tax evasion. One sentence, however – depending on the wording – can shake the whole foundation of trust, such as the statement by the Bank of England and the Treasury that a digital pound “would not be anonymous because the ability to identify and verify users is needed to prevent financial crime”. This pours petrol on the concern that, unlike physical money, users will indeed lose their privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where the banks are seeking to combat crime, which requires some form of user identification, the conspiracy theorists see this as confirmation of planned state surveillance and control. Central banks must, therefore, pay close attention to their communications to avoid making contradictory statements – or statements open to perverse interpretation – that reinforce the assumptions of conspiracy theorists. Robert Holzmann, Governor of the Austrian Central Bank, made clear that the narratives surrounding CBDCs are problematic because of their negativity: “What is still missing is a convincing storyline for the digital euro, something which we can put up in front of people”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether central banks will succeed in convincing the public about the value and benefits of CBDCs and present a storyline that is immune to conspiracy distortion remains to be seen. What is clear is that the grey suits will need to be far more dynamic in their communication if they want to roll back the growing prevalence of distrust and conspiracy surrounding their intentions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;陳梓華錄口供自言經常取笑攬炒派 今庭上改口稱當時不是說真話&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/cQKIwxC.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（25日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第66日審訊。陳梓華繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供，他今開始接受辯方盤問。辯方透露陳於2021年3月31日同意以證人身份協助本案，並展示多份供詞紀錄。陳的書面供詞引述 Mark Simon 說：「你需要思考嘅係點樣將你嘅生活重回正軌，因為香港唔會再有呢啲咁大型嘅社會活動發生。」惟陳承認當時向警察說的話並非真確。供詞亦顯示陳自言：「我本人都係唔 buy（攬炒），因為我成日笑佢哋就係話，你話攬炒、攬炒，咁到𠵱家攬炒咗啲乜嘢出嚟呢？即係我都會調侃佢哋。」不過當辯方追問陳當時是否在說真話。陳回答：「我有笑攬炒呢個概念」，之後突然說：「因為我自己攬炒咗自己。」陳最後承認書面供詞所述的說話是虛假的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已認罪的被告陳梓華第八天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行作主問完畢，接著由代表黎智英的御用大律師 Marc Corlett 盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方透露陳梓華2021年3月同意做證人協助本案-與警方會面合共81次103小時&quot;&gt;辯方透露陳梓華2021年3月同意做證人協助本案 與警方會面合共81次、103小時&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marc Corlett 透露，陳梓華於2021年3月31日同意就本案提供協助，之後以證人身份先後進行4次錄影會面，亦錄取了4份書面供詞，連同上述會面，陳與警方合共會見了81次，歷時103小時。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marc Corlett 指，在上述會面及口供之中，陳從沒跟警方說在2020年7月1日《國安法》生效之後，他與黎智英曾經透過電話聯絡。陳確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，陳亦確認在《國安法》生效之後，他沒有與黎智英親身會面或進行任何線上會議，而二人於2020年6月16日在壹傳媒大樓的會面是最後一次。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就 WhatsApp 訊息，黎與陳之間的最後一則訊息是在2020年6月16日；至於 Signal 訊息，紀錄顯示黎與陳之間的最後一則訊息是在2020年7月13日。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華確認一些過往合法活動在國安法後變成不合法&quot;&gt;陳梓華確認一些過往合法活動在國安法後變成不合法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marc Corlett 續指，陳梓華連日來在庭上供述《國安法》生效之前他所做過的事，可是他被起訴的控罪僅涵蓋2020年7月1日至2021年2月15日，而非《國安法》生效之前的時段。陳被起訴的「協助罪犯」和「串謀勾結外國勢力危害國家安全」僅牽涉《國安法》生效之後的活動。陳確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marc Corlett 續指，《國安法》於2020年6月30日午夜生效，而法律條文在生效之前才公布，陳表示不記得，而且他在數日之後才閱讀條文。Marc Corlett 問陳是否知道，一些過往被視為合法的活動，在《國安法》生效之後變成不合法。陳確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指國安法後應繼續推動制裁-因見黎智英無畏無懼以身作則&quot;&gt;陳梓華指國安法後應繼續推動制裁 因見黎智英無畏無懼、以身作則&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示陳梓華與李宇軒之間的 Signal 訊息，在2020年7月23日，陳向李說，不知道《國安法》對李而言代表什麼（“I am not sure about the implication of NSL on you.”），但是這不代表在新法例下什麼也不做（“Yet, it does not (mean) we don’t do anything under the new law.”）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問陳的訊息意思是否指，雖然在新法例下有些活動是不合法，但是他不會停止推動民主運動。陳指不是，反指該訊息其中一個意思，是「因為喺海外依然有好多 Stand with Hong Kong 嘅成員，佢哋依然可以呼籲制裁」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又問，陳的意思是否指身處香港的人士要小心、在紅線範圍內行事；或者香港人與海外人士可以做的事情有分別。陳表示以上皆不是。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，陳的意圖是否將來會蓄意違反《國安法》。陳則表示，當時的想法是「視乎有咩人喺身邊」，他解釋：「如果依然有人繼續努力緊，例如李宇軒、黎智英，呢啲我認識嘅人都為咗香港努力緊，我諗我最尾都會做。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方舉出數個情況，問陳是屬於哪一種情況，較極端的情況是有人不會再參與民主活動；另一個極端情況是有人認為反正最終都會被捕，所以不理會《國安法》，繼續做他們正在做的事情；介乎兩個極端之間的情況是，有人會在參與民主運動的時候考慮做什麼，避免觸犯《國安法》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳則回答，當時他向李宇軒說這番說話的時候，「我認為係要繼續推動制裁」，他解釋：「因為我當時覺得，連黎智英呢啲級數嘅人都可以無畏無懼，甚或乎以身作則，所以我覺得有啲嘢係應該做，但做到邊一步，當時我仲思考緊。」辯方追問陳是否有意違法，陳則表示：「我有咁嘅傾向，但係咪真係咁做，當時仲諗緊。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華確認黎智英從沒叫他做違法事情&quot;&gt;陳梓華確認黎智英從沒叫他做違法事情&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，在《國安法》生效之後，陳有否向黎智英表明他及李宇軒會繼續做國際游說，以推動外國制裁香港官員。陳表示沒有。辯方指，在《國安法》生效之後，陳與黎智英從沒有討論過《國安法》的影響。陳亦確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，黎智英從沒有叫陳做任何違反《國安法》的事。陳確認。辯方又指，陳從沒有告訴黎，他會進行違法《國安法》的活動。陳一度問：「係咪包括我通過 Mark Simon？」法官李運騰則叫陳撇除他向 Mark Simon 說過的東西。陳遂回答沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指，在《國安法》生效之後的任何時間，陳與黎智英從沒達成口頭協議，同意進行違反《國安法》的活動。陳同意沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華否認電話聲稱會安排李宇軒離港&quot;&gt;陳梓華否認電話聲稱會安排李宇軒離港&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，李宇軒在2020年8月10日被捕，其後在8月12日從警署獲得擔保，同年8月23日在公海被內地公安拘捕，直至2021年3月22日才被移交回香港。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，根據李宇軒的證供，李從警署獲釋之後，陳梓華曾經在電話中聲稱會安排李離開香港，辯方問陳是否真有其事。陳則稱沒有發生。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續問，在李宇軒從警署保釋直至他被內地公安拘捕之間，陳梓華有否與李聯絡過。陳稱有，是關於李談論自己去向、想借錢，以及在另一次通話中，「佢（李）講過佢如果有咩事，有咩想交低，例如佢叫我照顧佢屋企人，同埋佢都講過 Stand with Hong Kong（重光團隊）想點。」李亦有表示他想離開香港。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指稱李宇軒希望用重光團隊的錢走佬&quot;&gt;陳梓華指稱李宇軒希望用「重光團隊」的錢「走佬」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「重光團隊」，陳引述，李宇軒當時稱「要繼續去打國際線，佢希望離開香港，咁佢就可以繼續 carry on」。陳又指李擔心沒有人留在香港，所以二人有談及日本線和美國線，「若然佢（李）真係走唔到，咁我又應唔應該走呢？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續稱，二人討論過李被捕之後可能對「重光團隊」的影響，因為李的手機內容全部會曝光。另外在一次視像會議中，有陳、李宇軒和劉祖廸參與，「佢（李）當時講走佬需要錢嘅時候，其實佢想用 Stand with Hong Kong 嘅錢，同埋想我哋籌錢畀佢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華同意李宇軒扣留內地後-沒有轉告mark-simon的說話給李&quot;&gt;陳梓華同意李宇軒扣留內地後 沒有轉告Mark Simon的說話給李&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，在李宇軒被扣留內地期間，陳有否與李聯絡。陳反問：「包唔包括佢寫信呢？」辯方則表示較關注陳有否聯絡李，而陳回答：「佢喺公海被捕之後，冇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另一邊廂，陳昨日供稱他於2020年10月被捕並獲警方擔保之後，Mark Simon 曾透過 Signal Call 告訴他，要繼續民主運動和國際游說，以推動制裁，並叫陳有心理準備會再被警方以《國安法》罪名拘捕。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，當時李宇軒正在內地扣留，因此陳梓華從沒有將上述與 Mark Simon 的對話內容告訴李。陳同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華書面供詞稱mark-simon從沒要求或指示做任何事-惟今改口否認&quot;&gt;陳梓華書面供詞稱Mark Simon從沒要求或指示做任何事 惟今改口否認&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，陳梓華同意以證人身份協助本案之後，分別於2021年4月28、29和30日進行了四次錄影會面，並分別於2021年5月3、4、5日，以及2022年11月10日錄取了四份書面供詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，Mark Simon 從沒有要求或指示陳梓華做任何事情，問陳是否正確，惟陳不同意。辯方續指，陳過去曾經作出過以上陳述，惟陳稱：「我冇印象有講過。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方遂展示陳於2020年10月11日錄取的供詞，其時陳尚未同意協助案件，當中陳稱：「Mark Simon 由我認識佢到今天，所有嘢，佢從來冇要求過、指示過我去做某一樣嘢，從來都冇。」陳確認當時有說過，惟他否認以上反映當時立場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華錄口供時稱mark-simon曾籲他生活重回正軌-惟今庭上改口稱是說謊&quot;&gt;陳梓華錄口供時稱Mark Simon曾籲他生活重回正軌 惟今庭上改口稱是說謊&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方另引述書面供詞，陳當時引述Mark Simon說：「你需要思考嘅係點樣將你嘅生活重回正軌，因為香港唔會再有呢啲咁大型嘅社會活動發生。」陳僅稱：「當時我係咁樣同警察講。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方追問，陳以上供詞所述的內容是否真確。陳回答：「唔係。」辯方向陳提議，陳供詞聲稱 Mark Simon 籲他生活重回正軌，但如今在庭上卻指此部份不是真確，故陳的庭上說法是一個謊言。陳否認：「我唔同意。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方則向陳提議，Mark Simon 曾籲他生活重回正軌，這陳述是真確；但陳後來錄取另一些書面供詞時，卻向警察稱 Mark Simon 籲他繼續國際游說，並不是真確。陳不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華書面供詞稱李柱銘邀請他出席黎智英飯局因他非港獨或攬炒派&quot;&gt;陳梓華書面供詞稱李柱銘邀請他出席黎智英飯局因他非港獨或攬炒派&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳早前供稱，他於2019年7月在民主黨創黨主席李柱銘的邀請下出席飯局，並首次與黎智英親身見面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方提議，該次飯局有可能是在2019年10月而非7月發生，而二人首次以 WhatsApp 通訊是在飯局之後。惟陳不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示陳於2020年10月11日錄取的書面供詞，他當時向警察稱，他曾經問過李柱銘「點解佢會鍾意同我接觸呢？」，而對方的說法是，「佢覺得我唔係嗰啲攬炒，又唔係港獨嗰啲人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳則稱第一次見面時李柱銘沒有提及邀請他的原因，後來在2019年7月「攬炒團隊」進行「中英聯合聲明登報」行動期間，李柱銘才有向他提及邀請原因，「佢有講過我唔係港獨嗰啲人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;曾向警稱不認同攬炒並經常取笑-陳梓華庭上改口否認-並稱不是真話&quot;&gt;曾向警稱不認同「攬炒」並經常取笑 陳梓華庭上改口否認 並稱不是真話&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;書面供詞亦顯示，陳當時向警方稱，李柱銘、黎智英和 Mark Simon「對於攬炒呢個概念係好負面嘅，佢哋係唔 buy 嘅」，陳又自言：「我本人都係唔 buy，因為我成日笑佢哋就係話，你話攬炒、攬炒，咁到𠵱家攬炒咗啲乜嘢出嚟呢？即係我都會調侃佢哋。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過，當辯方問及陳對「攬炒」的態度時，陳否認他「唔 buy」，又否認經常取笑、調侃那些想要「攬炒」的人。對於陳是否曾經向警方說過上述供詞，陳卻一概表示：「我冇印象」，又說：「我冇玩過任何攬炒嘅人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方遂追問陳，當陳告訴警方他本人「唔 buy」攬炒概念，以及經常取笑和調侃想攬炒的人的時候，是否在說真話。陳回答：「我有笑攬炒呢個概念」，之後突然說：「因為我自己攬炒咗自己。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方再次問陳，書面供詞所述的說話是否真確。陳最後以英語回答：「False.」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華3年前錄影會面稱被李柱銘介紹為和理非-惟今庭上稱沒有印象&quot;&gt;陳梓華3年前錄影會面稱被李柱銘介紹為「和理非」 惟今庭上稱沒有印象&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，陳在首次與黎智英會面的飯局中，黎想知道陳是一名「和理非」還是主張使用暴力的人。陳確認。辯方續指，如果陳是主張使用暴力的人，黎便不會與陳交流；如果陳是一名「和理非」，黎便會與他交流。而李柱銘在席間告訴黎智英，陳並不是主張暴力的人，而是一名「和理非」。惟陳表示對此沒有印象。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方遂展示陳於2021年4月28日的錄影會面謄本，顯示陳當時向警察稱：「李柱銘好清晰咁話畀佢（黎）知其實我係一個和理非嚟嘅，咁佢（黎）就話『唔，咁好』。」惟陳則稱，他僅記得李柱銘介紹他是做登報行動和眾籌的人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方質疑，直到今日，陳不能清晰地記得李柱銘向黎智英介紹他為一名「和理非」，而陳承認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指錄影會面距離今天約有3年，問陳是否同意如今他對第一次出席黎智英飯局的記憶不及3年前。陳則稱：「唔一定。」辯方質疑，陳的意思是否他的記憶會隨著時間流逝而變得更好？陳卻否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方另外問陳是否勇武派一份子、是否示威的前線參與者，以及是否與暴力示威有關。陳一概否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In mid-March 2024, the Centre for Finance and Security (CFS) at RUSI convened one-to-one meetings with key representatives of the public and private sectors in Malta. CFS also held a sanctions-focused roundtable discussion involving 25 local stakeholders, as well as an evening event consisting of a panel discussion and networking with over 100 attendees from the public and private sector, and the University of Malta. These events were held under the Chatham House rule and as part of RUSI’s ongoing study of sanctions implementation and wider responses to illicit finance (Euro SIFMANet). This report represents the findings and views of the CFS team that participated in the visit. The visit was funded by the UK’s Serious Organised Crime Network (SOCNet).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with previous engagements under the Euro SIFMANet programme, the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) evaluation of the host country, this time Malta, underpins the discussions about illicit finance. This is especially relevant for Malta given it was placed on the FATF list of Jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring (the “grey list”) for strategic deficiencies in its regime to counter money laundering, terrorist financing and proliferation financing between June 2021 and June 2022. This was primarily due to the “detection of inaccurate company ownership information and sanctions on gatekeepers who fail to obtain accurate beneficial ownership information, as well as the pursuit of tax-based money laundering cases utilising financial intelligence”. Sanctions were not identified as a factor contributing to Malta’s placement on the grey list with technical compliance for Recommendation 6 and Recommendation 7 rated as Largely Compliant and Compliant respectively. For Immediate Outcome 10 concerning terrorist financing preventive measures and financial sanctions and Immediate Outcome 11 regarding proliferation financing financial sanctions, Malta received a Moderate and Substantial rating, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roundtable participants and wider interviewees all agreed that Malta has a unique experience in Europe in implementing UN and EU sanctions given its historic and close economic exposure to Libya during the era of Muammar Qadhafi and following the Arab uprisings of 2011 when sanctions were imposed. This ensured that sanctions structures and frameworks were already in place for both the public sector – and elements of the private sector – prior to the sanctions related to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. For example, Malta had already established a sanctions public–private partnership (PPP) known as the Joint Economic Financial Sanctions Implementation Task Force (JEFSI). JEFSI facilitates outreach and engagement to share information and gather the financial sector’s views. Roundtable participants considered the Libya sanctions as having been more disruptive than Russia sanctions because Malta had greater prior exposure to Libya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Malta does not implement US sanctions, there was consideration of Libya-related sanctions issued by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) because of Malta’s reliance on US correspondent banking services. However, Maltese courts have delivered judgments that, in effect, invalidate OFAC sanctions since they conflict with EU, and therefore Maltese, laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More widely, interviewees also noted that while not explicitly related to sanctions, there is an ongoing issue with compliance-related fines levied by the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU) being appealed and substantially reduced on constitutional grounds. These rulings at the First Instance are being appealed and this issue awaits a ruling by the Constitutional Court. This has impacts on the FIAU’s bandwidth and credibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;overview-of-legislative-and-enforcement-framework&quot;&gt;Overview of Legislative and Enforcement Framework&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Chapter 365 of the Laws of Malta, sanctions are implemented under the National Interest (Enabling Power) Act. The National Interest Act, Article 7 has established the Sanctions Monitoring Board (SMB) as the national competent authority responsible for monitoring the implementation and operation of sanctions legislation in Malta. The SMB was established within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and European Affairs and Trade (MFET) and comprises 18 officials representing various government ministries and authorities. The SMB has the power to propose persons or entities for de-listing, to unfreeze their assets, or to propose entities to be designated by the UN Security Council or the Council of the European Union. The FIAU, Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) and the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) collaborate with the SMB to ensure that subject persons comply with the Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UN sanctions are automatically applicable in Malta under the National Interest Act, and regulations and restrictive measures of the Council of the European Union and European Commission also apply due to Malta’s EU membership. Fines for sanctions violations are imposed by the National Interest Act. Individuals convicted of such violations face imprisonment ranging from 12 months to 12 years, and fines ranging from €25,000 to €5 million, while legal entities may be fined between €80,000 and €10 million. While OFAC sanctions are not directly enforceable under Maltese law, the SMB has issued several guidance notes drawing attention to decisions made by the OFAC, particularly concerning Maltese nationals and legal entities featured on the list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;maltas-wider-financial-landscape&quot;&gt;Malta’s Wider Financial Landscape&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviewees, more broadly, noted Malta’s effective tax rate of 5% for foreign companies has likely contributed to an industry for designated non-financial businesses and professionals (DNFBPs) and trust and company service providers (TCSPs). Like many international financial centres, the economy is heavily dependent on this sector with significant income from company formation and fiduciary services. However, there were historically significant issues with the quality of due diligence checks as evidenced by the FATF grey-listing. There have been improvements that resulted in Malta’s removal from the grey list and extensive documentation has been published by the FIAU. The move to a harmonised international taxation system could be a significant blow to Malta’s economy unless there is further diversification and new income streams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, interviewees raised issues related to Malta’s citizenship by investment (CBI) or “golden passport” programme. Under this scheme, individuals can become Maltese citizens by investing between €600,000 and €750,000, residing in Malta between 12 and 36 months, and purchasing or renting property. Since 2014 there have been 2,300 applicants of which 735 were Russian or Belarussian nationals. Of these, 559 were successful and some applicants were very high-profile. In 2020, Russians were still the largest group of new Maltese citizens. Some of these applicants also held dual or multiple nationalities. Since 2022, the CBI programme has been suspended for Russian and Belarussian applicants due to the difficulties in obtaining information to conduct due diligence checks. While new citizens are published annually in theMalta Gazette, how they became citizens – for example, by marriage or the CBI process – and their original nationality are not stated. There is no requirement to retain a nexus or remain in Malta once citizenship is granted. There is also an unhelpful view locally that most Russian golden passport holders and their funds pose only a limited risk as they do not often remain in Malta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citizenship can be revoked through a deprivation process. However, this is rare. Once placed on the OFAC sanctions list, Russian golden passport holders have been stripped of their Maltese citizenship. Other procedures are ongoing against nationals who have appeared on EU and US sanctions lists. There is a right of appeal in the deprivation process that can add legal complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Commission is currently taking legal action against Malta. It considers granting EU citizenship in return for pre-determined payments without a genuine link to a member state to be a breach of EU laws. There have been improvements in conducting CBI-related enhanced due diligence, policies and procedures, and collaboration with the FIAU following grey-listing. The final judgment by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) is expected by the end of 2024. This may lead to the closure of the CBI programme, significant amendments to it, or, least likely, the continuation of the programme without change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As at the end of December 2022, there were 338 remote gaming or online gambling companies registered in Malta. These are a significant part of Malta’s economy, making up 9.6% of gross value added (GVA) of Malta and employing 5.5% of the country’s total workforce. Online gaming companies are regulated entities under the Malta Gaming Authority and have the usual obligations under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and the National Interest Act. Wider discussions with interviewees noted that online gaming companies are focused on growth, revenue generation and technology development with compliance often a secondary consideration. This is reflected in the funding and resourcing of compliance departments. The low prioritisation of compliance is especially the case in the numerous smaller companies. Online gaming compliance has traditionally been focused on responsible gambling directives, fraud and, more recently, anti-money laundering (AML), countering terrorist financing (CTF) and counter-proliferation financing. The additional requirements and complexities for sanctions screening, especially the move from purely list-based screening, has challenged iGaming companies. Their ability to integrate cost-effective solutions with existing back-office systems is challenging and changes take months to implement. While there is exposure to markets in the Baltic states and Eastern Europe, there have been no reported sanctions breaches related to Russia or Belarus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More widely, interviewees also touched on the virtual financial assets activities in Malta. Malta has expressed its desire to attract cryptocurrency exchanges or virtual asset service providers (VASPs) as “the blockchain island” although this has been less successful than anticipated. Malta, despite its relatively small size was previously an outsize market for cryptocurrencies. In 2018, Malta reportedly saw up to €60 billion in cryptocurrency transactions. According to the World Bank, this figure was around five times Malta’s 2018 GDP of €14 billion. The figure of €60 billion is challenged by the supervisory authorities in that it likely attributes this to Binance’s trading activity. However, Binance did not ultimately apply to be licensed in Malta and the MFSA issued warnings to this effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The introduction of the Virtual Financial Assets Acts (the Digital Acts) in June 2018, which are similar to the incoming EU Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) Regulations, saw a drop in the use of cryptocurrency to under €4 billion by 2020. In effect, the requirement to meet the same standards in traditional financial products meant that cryptocurrency companies did not want to operate in Malta. While this could be considered a red flag, it is just as likely that VASPs moved to find the least demanding regulatory environments that offered similarly low corporation tax benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, around 180 companies had applied but 85% did not continue their activities in Malta, with 23 eventually applying for licences. As of 30 June 2023, there were 15 licensed VASPs, with 11 actively operating, one which had not started operating and three had surrendered their licences voluntarily. In 2023, Chainalysis rated Malta as 123rd in the world for cryptocurrency usage. There are no reports of Russian sanctions-related breaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of this innovative and dynamic ecosystem of finance- and technology-focused companies in Malta, there is a prevalence of payment service providers (PSPs) – that is, payment gateways rather than money remitters. This presents a vulnerability since PSPs can process large volumes of transactions, mix payment flows and generally complicate the payment landscape. Like many of the remote-gaming companies and VASPs that they support, PSPs are often “start-up” companies with a greater focus on growth and revenue generation and lack the size and sophistication of compliance resources and technology commensurate with the volume and value of payments they facilitate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private sector actors at the roundtable pointed out that the EU’s introduction of conflicting legislation was especially challenging. On 26 February 2024, the Council of the European Union adopted a regulation to make instant payments fully available in euros to consumers and businesses in the EU and EEA countries. This new regulation will mean that all banks and PSPs will be required to make credit transfers within 10 seconds of payment being ordered. Aside from the great boon to fraudsters using authorised push payment fraud schemes, this will make sanction screening even more burdensome and risky. The regulation will also change screening requirements so it is not just limited to parties; requirements will extend to consider the purpose of the transaction, the IBAN, blocked banks and countries. There is the potential for a huge number of false positives. These would then have to be investigated, requiring extensive resources as well as re-calibration of the screening tools. This requirement puts the banks and PSPs in an awkward position. They would have to satisfy competing requirements. Resolving this tension would best be addressed at an EU level to ensure the private sector can effectively implement sanctions and not expend resources and effort on false positives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;changes-since-february-2022&quot;&gt;Changes since February 2022&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since February 2022, various Maltese authorities have issued guidelines on sanctions. On 22 February 2022, the MFSA published a public notice regarding the situation in Ukraine reminding its licence holders of their obligation to effectively screen sanctions. In March 2022, in response to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Malta’s FIAU issued a guidance note reminding all subject persons of their obligations on sanctions and AML and CTF regulations. In June and July 2022, the SMB issued several guidance notes on the interpretation of some of the restrictive measures. Article 5n prohibited the provision of a range of services including accounting, auditing, tax and public relations. Article 5m focused on the administration of trust funds and foundations involving Russian nationals as settlors, beneficiaries or trustees, and Article 5b of the EU regulation related to SWIFT and SEPA channels and the restrictions on deposits over €100,000. In October 2022, it published a guidance on Russia and Belarus sanctions (including the eighth package) which included new designations, wider geographic scope, and visa restrictions, financial restrictions, trade restrictions and broadcasting restrictions. In January 2024, the SMB published further guidance on the EU prohibition on the sale or transfer of ownership of oil tankers to Russia-based individuals or entities as part of the 12th EU sanctions package. Associations and commercial legal and consultancy firms have amplified these guidance notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;public-sector-challenges-and-responses&quot;&gt;Public Sector Challenges and Responses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engagement with the public sector mainly took place during the roundtable session although there was also further engagement and discussion during the networking event. The SMB under the MFET is the lead entity for outreach, training and guidance. While relatively well-established, the SMB is under-resourced and lacks the breadth of skills necessary to drive full implementation. It therefore must use the resources of the MFSA and FIAU to conduct inspections. This does have benefits as the SMB understands sanctions. However, it does not necessarily understand the complexities and breadth of financial services. Other agencies can provide this expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the roundtable, representatives from the SMB noted that sanctions have increased sevenfold over the past two years, with queries becoming much more technical and complex. The demands this generates have been offset by better collaboration within government and also with the private sector. There has been an increase in the amount and types of outreach with consultancies, VASPs and the commercial sector. This outreach includes logistics and import/export companies now encountering sanctions restrictions on goods and services with which they are not familiar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SMB is well connected including with the European Commission, and the SMB reported that it was visited by DG FISMA (the lead Directorate for sanctions implementation) in November 2023. It is also aware of and involved in the DG REFORM-sponsored Technical Support Instrument (TSI). This is a capacity-building programme for member states – and its use must be requested by the member state itself rather than being imposed on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To supplement the capacity of the SMB, the MFSA and FIAU act as agents of the SMB via memoranda of understanding. They too face challenges of resourcing and the dynamic nature of the sanctions regimes. The MFSA and the SMB require regulated (“subject”) persons – including accountants, lawyers and auditors – to screen their clients against the sanctioned individuals list. As defined under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), subject persons must monitor their business relationships and check the list of designations from the EU, the UN and the SMB. Failure to comply may result in administrative penalties ranging from €100 to €800. Interviewees who are local financial crime experts did not consider these penalties to be a proportionate, dissuasive and effective sanction. The MFSA and FIAU conduct inspections following an agreed methodology with each inspection having a separate focus on sanctions. The report is submitted to the SMB which deals with the sanctions-related elements of the inspection as required. Small entities usually used only basic and manual processes to comply with these requirements but also had requisite smaller and less complex issues. It was noted that even larger banks have struggled to deal with the increased number of sanctions-related screening hits which include false positives, as they often lack the automation or resources to deal with the higher volume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Malta Business Registry (MBR) is considered a key element of the national sanctions architecture. It has benefited from the scrutiny placed on it following the FATF Mutual Evaluation and requirement to reach an agreed international operational standard. The SMB has unrestricted access to the Register of Beneficial Owners. However, following the European Court of Justice’s November 2022 ruling – that found that access to beneficial ownership interfered with privacy rights – the MBR restricted access to the registry, limiting it to subject persons and competent authorities. This matter is currently under revision in Brussels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MBR has a multi-pronged approach (the registry approach, the company approach and the existing information approach) to ensure information on the beneficial ownership of a company is accurate and up to date. It conducts its own know your customer (KYC) checks and has subsequently implemented a second KYC screening system for sanctions from which positive hits are sent to the SMB. A problem raised at the roundtable is that the process companies undergo to notify of changes to information held by the registry is retrospective and lengthy: they must communicate these changes through their banks rather than directly to the MBR. While this ultimately closes the loop, it is not an efficient or timely process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Malta Ship Registry is the largest in the EU and one of the largest in the world, contributing about 14% of Malta GDP. The Shipping Directorate sits within Transport Malta (TM) and has processes in place for checking databases for positive hits of ships, entities and people when new sanctions are published. There is extensive guidance published by TM Maritime on the various EU restrictive measures. Vessels are put under review on a case-by-case basis to understand their exposure to sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian Maritime Register of Shipping has been removed and, for the oil price cap, registered owners are required to give appropriate information and attest that they are abiding by the requirements. The current assessment is that no Maltese-registered vessels were facilitating operations above the price cap and no breaches have been detected. However, one participant at the roundtable commented that because of these actions, tankers that were previously registered in Malta are being sold or re-flagged; this is impacting Malta’s revenue. Others at the roundtable agreed with this view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the centrality of maritime business to Malta, Malta Customs plays a key role in sanctions implementation. Customs staff are clearly knowledgeable and have a good understanding of specific technical issues but – consistent with all government agencies in the country – lack resources and are unsurprisingly losing experience to the private sector even as their workload increases. The roundtable discussions identified a notable gap: while the customs authority has a good understanding of strategic trade controls, trade documentation and red flags, it cannot legally investigate any breaches. Should a sanctions infringement be suspected, Malta Customs refers the matter to the SMB Chair who would consider whether there is a case for referral to the police for further investigation. As a result, this documentation is sent to the SMB, along with the trade-related documents, for its consideration. However, as noted earlier, the SMB has neither the expertise nor resources to investigate these cases itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malta Customs uses the Common Customs Risk Management System (CRMS) – provided by the EU’s DG Tax and Customs Union. This system allows Malta Customs to securely share information with customs authorities of other EU member states. The upload of information is manual and time-consuming. CRMS is not available to other government entities in Malta although there are both formal and informal cross-government information sharing mechanisms. Malta Customs submits relevant reports to the World Customs Organization Customs Enforcement Network. However, sensitive sanctions information is not always shared as it is a global system and thus a wide range of actors have access to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malta Customs is aware that there has been significant downturn in transactions to Russia. However, there are more red flags related to companies potentially acting as proxies. These may include, for example, obviously newly formed companies with no justification, rationale or purpose, or changes in activity where the end user is declared as being in a new third country where previously there was little or no trading relationship. Customs is aware of the need to look at the wider connections of these suspicious entities, but there is little evidence or proof on which to take enforcement action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Malta Police Force’s (MPF) Financial Crimes Investigations Department (FCID) does not have experience of investigating sanctions – the bulk of its experience relates to money laundering and terrorist financing. It is fully aware of the challenges posed by the transnational element of sanctions evasion and resulting investigations. Therefore, there is use of established cross-border information exchange mechanisms such as requests for information (RFIs) to the FIAU and SMB. The FIAU can then leverage FIUNet and the SMB can send RFIs on to the EU, for example. However, these are not always standard actions and are, of course, time consuming. The FCID has undergone extensive restructuring and now has more resources. However, it has also seen a significant churn in senior leadership. Wider discussions with interviewees noted the significant improvements in supervision but that the forthcoming, albeit currently not scheduled, Moneyval Mutual Evaluation will likely focus on the FCID’s effectiveness in investigating all forms of financial crime, including sanctions. It was also considered that despite efforts to improve the FCID, it still does not have the necessary capacity and capability to conduct complex investigations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;private-sector-challenges-and-responses&quot;&gt;Private Sector Challenges and Responses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implementation of the EU’s packages of restrictive measures on Russia has been challenging due to the volume and speed with which the packages have come forward and the lack of resources and capability in the market from a compliance perspective. Participants at the roundtable noted that these have roughly doubled the workload of the banking sectors’ compliance staff without a commensurate increase in resourcing. The larger banks already had some capacity and capability. However, the smaller banks, the non-bank financial institutions and the designated non-financial businesses and professions struggled in terms of their lack of capacity and expertise. Smaller banks have no specialist sanctions resources and rely on generalist financial crime compliance staff or the money laundering reporting officer (MLRO) or deputy MLRO to cover sanctions-related issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An industry-wide issue identified by roundtable private sector participants – and consistently raised across the EU – is the need to supplement name screening against sanctions lists with the new requirement to implement activity-based sanctions (for example, the provision by clients of certain services prohibited by sanctions). This has been particularly challenging as these restrictions are unrelated to the capabilities of traditional sanctions screening or transaction monitoring systems. This is especially the case for smaller banks that are already struggling with this issue from an AML/CTF perspective. Private sector participants also noted the challenge posed by the observed shift in transactions to third countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although there are a range of potentially systemic issues facing Maltese financial institutions in effectively implementing sanctions, the risks are somewhat offset. The heightened focus of the industry on risk management in recent years means that even the larger banks now have less geographic risk. They are more focused on domestic retail banking and servicing local corporates. As Russia is not a core market for the industry, where exposure is identified, it is an easy decision to de-risk by offboarding a client. However, 48% of the companies registered in Malta do not have bank accounts in Malta itself. This is a potential vulnerability in a system where there is a reliance on controls on banks but only 52% of the companies have accounts that can be monitored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the bigger banks, the issue now is passing on the information from compliance departments – that are focused on and understand the regulatory aspects – to the lines of business which are focused on revenue generation or customer service. While they aim to provide the lines of business with clear policies, procedures and training, it is also necessary to change the mindset from AML/CTF to sanctions. As an example of improvements in this area, customer risk assessments now specifically include sanctions and affect risk ratings. Even then, there are difficulties of interpretation when faced with pressure to onboard or retain customers when there is an element of risk, but no clear sanctions breach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Malta Bankers’ Association reported that it has formed a sanctions sub-working group which ensures its members are kept abreast of sanctions issues, have a forum to discuss and develop best practice and also reach out to the SMB and other government agencies to make queries or give feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the banking sector, elements of the private sector such as DNFBPs and TCSPs lack sophisticated knowledge of sanctions issues. Importantly, these entities service key high-risk elements of the Russia sanctions regime, notably the maritime sector and high net worth Russians in other countries. There is an obstacle to convincing them of the necessity of these measures, especially since there has been no Russia-sanctions-evasion “smoking gun” in Malta, unlike Cyprus, and far less exposure to Russian investments, for example in the real estate sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the private sector in Malta, the lack of relevant data may suggest an absence of evidence – rather than evidence of absence – of sanctions evasion activity. However, without more detailed data and analysis, it is hard to corral effort and resources in pursuit of activity that may simply endorse the limited sanctions risk exposure Malta faces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-insights-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Key Insights and Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malta’s experience of having to deal with UN, US and EU sanctions related to Libya and the rigours of FATF grey-listing gave it a head start in setting up the structures and processes to deal with the Russia sanctions regimes. For example, PPPs involving banks and other regulated entities are well-established. However, the lack of laws to enable prosecutions, the lack of investigative skills and resources, and weak enforcement resulting in a failure of proportionate, effective and dissuasive sanctions are key shortfalls that will need to be addressed if Malta is to prove fully effective in implementing restrictive measures on Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following observations for consideration emerged from the roundtable and wider discussions with interviewees:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provide guidance on implementing laws to facilitate prosecution of sanctions evasion.&lt;/strong&gt; Maltese law criminalises sanctions evasion but there is a need for some key amendments to facilitate and expedite prosecutions (as with AML breaches). This requires improving the quality of private sector reporting, sanctions investigations to develop intelligence and evidence, and education of prosecutors and judges. Furthermore, there needs to be the appetite and capacity to prosecute sanctions evasion, but this can only happen with an appropriate legal framework. The use of deferred prosecution agreements for sanctions breaches should be implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design and deliver training programmes to upskill private sector resources.&lt;/strong&gt; There is a need to upskill and increase resources in certain sectors. This is not necessarily the case in larger banks, but rather the smaller trade finance banks and the sectors that are more exposed but lack experience of compliance and screening activities such as DNFBPs, TCSPs, import/export and logistics companies. Relying on the major banks to police their clients for sanctions implementation leaves significant gaps and exposes Malta to risks from those entities that do not draw on banking services in Malta. Better private sector investigations and reporting will assist government entities in their investigation and enforcement efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design and deliver training programmes to upskill government sector resources.&lt;/strong&gt; There is a need to upskill and increase the number of resources in key government agencies, specific to sanctions. This is a cross-government need, including the SMB, MFSA, FIAU, Malta Customs and the FCID, to ensure they can support the compliance aspects of the sanctions regimes (for example intelligence-led activity, pro-actively communicating guidance to the private sector and answering implementation queries), but more importantly identifying and ensuring successful enforcement against breaches through specialised sanctions investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What emerged from the roundtable discussion and wider interviews is that as a result of its experience of being closely linked to the Libyan economy at the time it was sanctioned in 2011, Malta clearly has a strong understanding of what is needed in terms of policies and government architecture to implement sanctions effectively. Yet it remains to be seen whether this clear understanding of policies can be effectively put into practice. There are silos of excellence but the comparatively well-developed architecture and partnerships do not mitigate the risks from the lack of resources and technical capabilities, such as investigations and intelligence analysis and dissemination. The lack of proportionate, effective and dissuasive enforcement action is also a key shortcoming. Given Malta’s position as home to international company registration, an active citizenship by investment scheme, an important maritime industry and an innovative FinTech scene made up of iGaming, PSPs and VASPs, it may well face considerable headwinds as the EU’s focus on restrictive measures moves from adding designations, to more closely monitoring the effectiveness of member state implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;陳梓華稱黎智英被捕對於「重光團隊」是沉重打擊 因失去美國政府內部消息及政治人脈&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/g5mNQCE.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（24日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第65日審訊。陳梓華繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。《國安法》生效之後，黎智英於2020年8月10日被拘捕，陳當日向李宇軒傳送訊息，指一些商家和政治人物與黎「割𥱊」。陳解釋，黎被捕對於「重光團隊」來說是「一個好沉重嘅打擊」，因為「如果冇黎智英嘅話，我哋冇可能再知道美國政府內部嘅消息，亦都會冇晒佢喺美國或其他地方嘅政治人脈」，而黎的人脈可以協助「重光團隊」推動制裁及節省資源。他又表示：「我淨係覺得，好似樹倒猢散咁。」另外，陳梓華於2020年10月10日被捕，之後獲警方擔保，他引述黎的私人助手 Mark Simon 的說話：「叫我唔使擔心，佢話『我同黎智英會安排各方面嘅支援畀你，亦都會喺美國安排後路畀你』」，不過「叫我有心理準備，我會再次被拘捕，罪名係《國安法》，叫我唔使擔心」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已認罪的被告陳梓華第七天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。由控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行作主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華要求李宇軒搭路會見美領事-冀李離開後接手其人脈&quot;&gt;陳梓華要求李宇軒搭路會見美領事 冀李離開後接手其人脈&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示陳梓華與李宇軒之間的 Signal 訊息，2020年8月3日，陳要求李聯絡時任美國領事館職員 Alan Brinker，以相約會面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳庭上解釋，當時他想李宇軒介紹香港的人脈給他認識，「因為當時有聲音或討論喺 Stand with Hong Kong（重光團隊，簡稱 SWHK）裡面，希望李宇軒能先行離開香港」，所以在當時而言，他認為他應該開始接手李的人脈。此外，SWHK 都想知道美國政府有什麼新意見，或者對DQ的看法，希望美國政府採取強硬的態度，「而當時大家期望見到嘅係制裁措施」，所以希望會見美領職員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;有關 SWHK 的討論，陳稱主要是「攬炒巴」劉祖廸告訴他，因為李宇軒處理過數次眾籌，「佢手上有好多其他成員嘅資料，如果佢被捕的話，對於成個 SWHK 都係一個風險。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問為何他們覺得李宇軒有被捕風險。陳稱因為當時李已經參與 IPAC，亦在聯合國曝了光、到訪過美國，以及「好高調咁做過監選團」等，「所以當時我哋認為佢已經觸犯咗《國安法》。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;訊息紀錄顯示，陳告訴李該會面是為了向美領事索取資訊（bumping info from him）。控方問，為何需要向美領事索取資訊。陳則稱：「因為當時黎智英教過我哋，就係我哋要知道外國政府嘅諗法，同埋要同啲枱底人建立關係⋯⋯當時 Alan Brinker，我諗算係半個枱底人」，因此從他身上得到一手資訊就變得很重要。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱若李宇軒離港會頂住佢個位-故視自己為領袖&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱若李宇軒離港會「頂住佢個位」 故視自己為「領袖」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年8月10日，黎智英被警方拘捕。李宇軒透過 Signal 問陳，是否需要把陳「踢」離開 Telegram 群組，又提到「每逢有人出事就會有人叫我同你快啲考慮走」；陳則回應「Brother」、「You know」、「As a leader」、「I have to be the last one standing」、「走走走，我若離開」、「誰來帶隊」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問陳在訊息中自稱「領袖」是什麼意思。陳稱：「因為當時我哋都相信自己係領袖團隊裡面嘅領袖角色」，在眾多 SWHK 成員之中，「我哋係少數比較活躍，而李宇軒、劉祖廸、Shirley Ho 佢哋都各自領導住其中一條線。」陳又稱，「而我當時就已經同李宇軒傾過，當佢離開香港之後，就會由我頂住佢個位，喺香港。所以當時我有一種咁樣嘅自我感覺。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱李宇軒不肯離開香港-故出言相勸&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱李宇軒不肯離開香港 故出言相勸&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華同日稍後時間向李宇軒傳送訊息，叫李離開香港，並留下陳一個在香港，因為「我們承受不了國際線再失去多一人」：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Brother, leave me here - we can’t afford one more lost in international line.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳庭上解釋，「國際線」是指「Stand with Hong Kong 一直打緊嘅國際線」，而「我們」是包括整個 SWHK、黎智英及其私人助手 Mark Simon。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳稱當時他與美國線的 Shirley Ho 討論過，她用了很多不同方法將李宇軒帶離香港，其中包括幫他找了一份美國的工作，也向他說了很多離開的理由，但李宇軒始終不肯離開香港。陳稱：「而根據我哋嘅默契，應該我係最後一個留喺香港嘅人，所以想勸佢離開香港。」陳傳送上述訊息之後，後來看新聞得悉李宇軒同日被捕。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於陳為何要在李宇軒離港後接手他的工作，陳稱：「因為若然喺香港冇人的話，就好難掌握到香港嘅情況；第二點係，如果我唔咁樣講，佢點都唔會走。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱失去黎智英是沉重打擊-因失去美國政府內部消息及人脈等&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱失去黎智英是沉重打擊 因失去美國政府內部消息及人脈等&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就陳另一則傳送給李的訊息「Some businessmen and politicians are cutting ties with Jim.」，陳解釋「Jim」即是代表黎智英（Jimmy Lai），「當時黎智英被捕，好多話會支持佢嘅人都同佢割𥱊，Mark Simon 話嗰時好 tough（艱難）。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又稱：「如果冇黎智英嘅話，我哋冇可能再知道美國政府內部嘅消息，亦都會冇晒佢喺美國或其他地方嘅政治人脈」，而且，「曾經好統一嘅、喺國際線上嘅目標，之後就未必會咁統一。所以當時對於我哋嚟講，係一個好沉重嘅打擊。」他稱：「黎智英喺美國嘅政治人脈，可以協助到 Stand with Hong Kong 推動制裁，亦都令到 Stand with Hong Kong 節省到好多資源。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;他稱上述資訊是 Mark Simon 告訴他的，但他未有查問 Mark 所指的是哪些商人，「我淨係覺得，好似樹倒猢散咁」，所以他才會向李傳送這個訊息，「因為我唔想佢有事。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱加入美國線群組有困難-後來在黎智英和mark-simon同意下成功入組&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱加入美國線群組有困難 後來在黎智英和Mark Simon同意下成功入組&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳稱，在2020年6月30日《國安法》生效之後，他與 Mark Simon 每星期至少透過電話聯絡一次，有時次數會更加多。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳稱在2020年8月的時候，他與 Mark Simon 討論過李宇軒的情況，形容李「好頑固想留喺香港」，亦討論過陳加入 SWHK 美國線的 Telegram 群組。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又稱，「攬炒巴」劉祖廸曾向他表示「將我加入美國線（Telegram 群組）有啲困難」，因為他們已經有固定成員，「對於其他人嚟講，我係新人，咁我一直都冇喺 Stand with Hong Kong 其他群組好積極講嘢，因為我根本唔喺嗰啲群組入面」，然而其他人則由登報行動開始已經加入群組，大家合作了一段時間，所以劉祖廸認為把陳梓華加入群組有難度。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指：「然後喺 Mark Simon 同黎智英嘅支持，同埋佢哋同意底下，最後我入到群組入面。」陳指劉祖廸告訴他，「如果 Mark Simon 同黎智英同意嘅話，咁我就會好講好多喇。」所以後來群組裡有一名叫「Madison」的用戶「會覺得我同黎智英嘅關係好密切。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後追問陳如何取得 Mark Simon 和黎智英的同意。陳則稱他在 Signal Call 中向 Mark Simon 解釋當時情況，「然後 Mark Simon 話佢會處理，然後我後來聯絡返劉祖廸嘅時候，佢話黎智英同 Mark Simon 同意，大家都冇反對。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳稱他在2020年6至7月之間被加入至 SWHK 美國線群組，從中發現群組負責人是 Shirley Ho，而且「我發現佢哋會定期每星期同 Mark Simon 報告返美國線做過啲咩」。當組員跟 Mark Simon 和政治顧問溝通之後，便會在群組中交代 Mark Simon 說過什麼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱佩洛西被邀加入ipac-曾問李柱銘意見&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱佩洛西被邀加入IPAC 曾問李柱銘意見&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳稱，他與 Mark Simon 另外談及「對華政策跨國議會聯盟」（Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China，簡稱 IPAC）。Mark Simon 曾告訴陳，在 IPAC 正式公布成立之前，創辦人裴倫德（Luke de Pulford）已經開始聯絡不同有份量的政治人物，包括時任美國眾議院議長佩洛西，而佩洛西向民主黨創黨主席李柱銘徵詢意見，而李柱銘則建議佩洛西不要加入IPAC，後來佩洛西亦沒有加入。陳指 Mark Simon 對此感到有點可惜，「Mark Simon 認為 IPAC 好重要，所以佢希望我都可以大力支持，去畀 IPAC。」陳又引述 Mark Simon 確是知悉「一直執行同埋實踐嗰個係李宇軒，所以佢覺得李宇軒離開香港係正確嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又稱，Mark Simon 當時「都想我落手落腳打國際線」，之前亦表示希望帶他到美國出席聽證會，但是疫情關係而做不到，「咁所以如果我入咗美國線嘅話，就可以有啲建樹。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱黎智英和mark-simon認為被捕是好事-能令蘋果銷量上升&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱黎智英和Mark Simon認為被捕是「好事」 能令《蘋果》銷量上升&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就黎智英於被捕一事，陳稱 Mark Simon 於2020年8月中曾經告訴他，「佢話佢同黎智英傾過，佢哋認為黎智英被捕，係一件好事，因為咁樣會令到更加多人關注，會令到《蘋果日報》銷量上升。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳稱二人亦談論李宇軒的工作，陳表示擔心李被捕會影響 IPAC，「啫係李宇軒搞咗個聯署，係反對《國安法》嘅，聲勢好浩大，然後亦都會擔心影響到 Stand with Hong Kong 嘅運作。」陳引述 Mark Simon 聽畢說：「唔使擔心，喺 Stand with Hong Kong 裡面，當時佢哋有 Plan B，就係推劉祖廸喺美國做巡迴演講，當時佢用嘅字眼係『college』，然後繼續去推廣攬炒嘅論述，同埋去推動制裁。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，因為李字軒被捕之後，「忽然之間就少咗一個人喺前面衝」，若然劉祖廸可以在美國不同大學做一些演講，「起碼會令美國嘅人更加容易接受一啲反華嘅政策」，以及能夠引起關注。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱黎智英較支持美國共和黨-因有較持續反華政策&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱黎智英較支持美國共和黨 因有較持續反華政策&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳稱 Mark Simon 曾經解釋過美國民主黨及共和黨之間的分別，亦提及「佢（Mark Simon）同黎智英都係比較支持共和黨」，「因為佢哋相信共和黨有比較持續嘅反華政策，會繼續推出一啲制裁措施。」陳續指：「民主黨方面呢，就傾向同中國合作，例如就住氣候呀、環保呀、經濟，咁係不利我哋想達到嘅『支爆』。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，Mark Simon 然後解釋為何要聘請政治顧問，因為共和黨黨員傾向較多是商家，所以基本上有錢「請得起」政治顧問，就可以跟這些共和黨黨員和官員會面。陳舉例，「黎智英曾經畀過一筆錢去請政治顧問，想去見彭斯。」此外，陳指：「民主黨方面呢，佢哋想要見一啲新嘅面孔，唔想再見到眾志或者係一啲舊學生領袖」，而 SWHK 當時是一個香港人自發的民間組織，而且是一個新組織，因此很符合美國民主黨的要求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指在《國安法》生效之後，SWHK 美國線接受 Mark Simon 的意見，聘請了一間比較親民主黨的政治顧問公司，然後接觸一些民主黨官員和「枱底人」，從而推動制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，SWHK 美國線亦接觸過一些政策評論員，「希望提醒呢啲政策評論員，香港嘅情況會威脅到美國喺香港嘅利益，咁就會令美國人更加反感，咁一啲制裁嘅措施，或者係對香港經濟不利嘅政策，就會更加容易通過。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱李宇軒想透過mark-simon-打聽另一在日華人身份&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱李宇軒想透過Mark Simon 打聽另一在日華人身份&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就日本線，陳梓華稱在《國安法》生效之後，SWHK 協助日本議員山尾志櫻里成立 JPAC（Japanese Parliamentary Alliance on China），想推動馬格尼茨基法案（Magnitsky Act）；李宇軒亦和山尾合作，想推動一個「救生艇政策」，即是「可以收留香港嘅政治犯，或者係畀當時嘅香港抗爭者，雖然未定罪，可以居留喺日本」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，當時他們認為《香港國安法》違反人權，「咁如果有咗 Magnitsky 的話，日本政府就有理據去制裁相關官員。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳稱他在2020年8至9月有將日本線的情況告知 Mark Simon，因為李宇軒告訴陳他遇到一名自稱「反華」的在日華人，聲稱可以幫助李，「但係當時李宇軒覺得有啲鬼」，所以透過陳向 Mark Simon 打聽該在日華人的身份，惟 Mark Simon 最終未有回覆陳。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華mark-simon及黎智英稱會安排美國後路-籲繼續做國際游說&quot;&gt;陳梓華：Mark Simon及黎智英稱會安排美國後路 籲繼續做國際游說&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年10月10日，陳梓華被警方以「協助罪犯」罪名拘捕，之後獲警方擔保。陳稱，他從警署獲釋數天之後聯絡 Mark Simon，他引述對方說話：「叫我唔使擔心，佢話『我同黎智英會安排各方面嘅支援畀你，亦都會喺美國安排後路畀你』，然後佢會繼續喺美國同台灣呢啲渠道去打聽我案件嘅消息，叫我乜都唔使做。」陳續指，「但係就叫我有心理準備，我會再次被拘捕，罪名係《國安法》，叫我唔使擔心。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳稱 Mark Simon 籲他「應該要繼續做國際游說嘅民主運動」，為了推動制裁。陳稱當時 Mark Simon 口中的「支援」是指法上的支援。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳稱直至2020年11月，他與 Mark Simon 再次聯絡，對方提及聘請了一名寫手替《蘋果日報》撰寫報導，關於當時美國總統候選人拜登的兒子在中國做生意，但後來該報導被指是假新聞，在美國當地可能會被視為干預大選，並且可能會引來美國聯邦調查局（FBI）調查，以及得失民主黨，所以 Mark Simon 與黎智英商討後，決定辭職，以免影響壹傳媒的利益，從而「保住壹傳媒」，「但係實際上，佢依然會喺美國同台灣繼續打點黎智英嘅生意，所以叫我唔使擔心佢。」如果陳想聯絡黎的話，可以繼續透過 Mark Simon 聯絡。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳表示，當時沒有留意黎智英去向。被問到《國安法》生效之後有否與黎聯絡，陳表示：「暫時冇印象。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方表示完成了大部份的主問，因此向法庭申請提早休庭，以確保沒有遺漏之後才開始辯方盤問。案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

But can the strategy address some of Australian defence’s more endemic problems?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Australian government has just released the country’s first National Defence Strategy (NDS), together with its accompanying Integrated Investment Plan (IIP). Australian governments often last three terms, so these two documents are likely to remain relevant into the next decade, albeit with biennial review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NDS is effectively a rebadged Defence White Paper, a long-used technique by which Australian governments have controlled the sprawling and big-spending Department of Defence. The difference is that the NDS is considered more expansive in that it looks beyond the Department to take a whole-of-government and whole-of-nation approach that connects all instruments of national power. The Department is now seen as one element contributing to the nation’s defence, rather than being responsible for its entirety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-strategy-for-worrying-times&quot;&gt;A Strategy for Worrying Times&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NDS argues that Australia’s strategic environment is continuing to deteriorate given increasing strategic competition between the US and China, major wars in Europe and the Middle East, a large Chinese arms build-up, and ongoing tensions over Taiwan and in the South China Sea. The solution is seen as a strategy of denial that prevents others projecting power against Australia from the seas to the north. Earlier defence white papers have made similar arguments; however, this latest incarnation has some new twists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The denial strategy’s contemporary implementation now “re-weights” the 2020 Strategic Update’s equal weighting assigned to the defence objectives of shaping, deterring and responding. Deterrence is now Australia’s primary strategic defence objective, with the others supporting this. Another change is the priority now attached to the Australian Defence Force (ADF) needing “the capacity to protect Australia’s economic connection to our region and the world”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IIP sets out how the NDS’s objectives will be met in terms of new equipment acquisitions for the ADF. Over the next 10 years, some A$330 billion will be spent, with the largest single-project budgetary outlays by far consisting of the nuclear attack submarines acquisition (estimated to cost A$53 billion to $A63 billion) and the building of six Hunter-class frigates (A$22 billion-A$32 billion).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The solution to Australia’s deteriorating strategic environment is seen as a strategy of denial that prevents others projecting power against Australia from the seas to the north&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This expenditure reflects the maritime focus of the denial strategy, but the next tier of megaprojects instead look to enhance ADF preparedness. These feature acquiring stocks of naval strike and air defence missiles such as Tomahawk, SM‑6 and Naval Strike Missiles ($12 billion-$15 billion); improving the ability to build guided weapons in Australia (A$16 billion-A$21 billion); and establishing additional logistics centres and capacity (A$10 billion-A$15 billion).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below this A$10 billion-plus tier, there are many smaller projects aimed at continuing to modernise the ADF. Of these, two less typical projects are the army receiving 26 landing craft to allow manoeuvre in the littoral in a manner akin to the US Marine Corps Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations concept, and the air force planning to fit hypersonic missiles on its F/A-18F Super Hornet fleet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tactical-or-strategic&quot;&gt;Tactical or Strategic?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, the NDS is a considerably more comprehensive and sophisticated document than last year’s Defence Strategic Review, which simply reflected a few consultants’ personal opinions and not the considered judgment of the Defence Department. Even so, the NDS is stronger at the tactical level than the strategic. It rather nicely sets out six capability effects (pp. 28–29) which are the broad requirements into which new and old equipment should fit. There is, though, no clear connection between this more tactical level and the primary strategic objective of deterrence; the linkage is assumed, not explained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is odd. Over the last two years, the foreign and defence minister have given numerous well-coordinated speeches and media statements to set out and explain Australia’s two grand strategies: a balance-of-power one addressing great power competition, and an engagement grand strategy focused on the region’s middle and small powers. The NDS occasionally alludes to the former while ignoring the latter, but both deeply involve and shape Defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may be a result of the use of scenarios to devise the NDS’s investment priorities, explained in detail in the IIP. Scenarios are well-suited for technical analysis of force-on-force interactions, and so their use here might have unintentionally pushed Defence towards exploring tactical-level issues instead of addressing strategic matters. Higher-level wargaming might now be useful to enhance today’s strategic debates and the anticipated 2026 revision of the NDS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bouquets-and-brickbats&quot;&gt;Bouquets and Brickbats&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the NDS’s goal of taking a national approach, the document attempts early on to integrate defence activities with the wider Australia. The NDS is considered as both working with and making investments useful to statecraft, national resilience, industrial resilience, supply chain resilience, innovation, science and technology, the national workforce and skills base, and the national intelligence community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While the Strategy is pleasantly open in noting a shortfall of some 4,400 ADF personnel, only marginal attempts appear to be being made to solve this&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This broad national approach is most evident in the many discussions across the NDS and the IIP on the naval shipbuilding and sustainment enterprise. Indeed, the AUKUS Pillar 1 nuclear submarine project can sometimes appear more a nation-building than a defence-related programme. The NDS also fits well with the prime minister’s new push for increasing manufacturing in Australia under the rubric of “A future made in Australia”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the two criticisms continually made of Australian defence since 2020 remain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, while the NDS is pleasantly open in noting a shortfall of some 4,400 ADF personnel – some 10% of the workforce – only marginal attempts appear to be being made to solve this. New equipment is being bought that will lack a workforce to operate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, to justify increasing defence spending, both the current and previous governments have argued for urgency in making the ADF battle-ready. However, the actions taken seem out of step with this rhetoric. Only two weeks before releasing these documents, the defence minister quietly signalled that short-term improvements to the ADF are now considered less pressing. He asserted that commentators focusing on this produced “analysis [that] lacks wit…. Australia’s challenge lies in the future beyond this. And here we must invest in the next-generation capabilities the ADF needs”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the main, the NDS and the IIP look to early next decade. The ADF of this decade will remain much as it is now.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;陳梓華稱初選最初構思者為黎智英 且「背後做咗好多功夫」促成初選&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/YYYrgMf.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（23日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第64日審訊。陳梓華繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供，控方展示陳與黎智英之間的訊息對話，在2020年7月初選結束之後，陳向黎發送訊息，感謝他為初選所做的一切。陳稱：「我諗我係少數人知道當初初選一直以嚟構思嘅係黎智英。」陳又指黎動用了大量人脈，以及媒體資源去協助初選舉行；而且當時並非所有人都同意初選的機制，以及爭議是否開放予所有人參與，「但係佢（黎）背後做咗好多功夫，最後促成咗初選。」此外，陳在2020年6月曾到壹傳媒大樓與黎見面，期間陳就《國安法》表達憂慮，並認為所有人不應該再繼續倡議制裁，惟陳引述黎稱：「《國安法》雷聲大、雨點小，佢唔會有事嘅。佢話佢會以身作則，會繼續喺唔同嘅媒體上面呼籲制裁同埋關注。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已認罪的被告陳梓華第六天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。由控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行作主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指當時國際線面對代表性問題-若黎智英引薦可增代表性&quot;&gt;陳梓華指當時國際線面對代表性問題 若黎智英引薦可增代表性&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;上周提到，黎智英在2020年1月8日透過 WhatsApp，向陳梓華傳送一篇裴倫德（Luke de Pulford）刊登於《蘋果日報》網站的文章連結。陳當時回覆稱他看過文章，認為可以幫助到他說服那些「頑固的領袖」；黎亦指文章值得閱讀，而「攬炒巴」劉祖廸也應該看。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 裴倫德 Luke de Pulford（左）、劉祖廸（右）（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今向陳出示裴倫德的文章，當中提及國際線上缺乏領袖會產生代表性的問題、國際社會需要知道香港人清晰的訴求、如果沒有國際支持的話香港人難以向北京爭取普選、要顧全大局及不要放棄等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳供稱，因為國際線並非鐵板一塊，但是當時沒有人能夠領導到國際線，而黎智英就想提供方向，以及團結「攬炒派」和國際線，從而令國際線有一個統一方向。此外，陳指反修例運動參與者一直都想匿名，但是很難在國際線上有代表性，而當時「攬炒團隊」和去過美國聽證會的人，都出現代表性的問題，但是如果有黎智英引薦或支持的話，他們在國際線上便能有代表性，外國官員和「枱底人」就會肯會見他們。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英轉發美國政府內部消息-不想暴力升級失國際支持&quot;&gt;黎智英轉發美國政府內部消息 不想暴力升級失國際支持&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年4月5日，黎智英向陳梓華轉發了美國政府的內部消息，當中稱美國政府關注示威者日益升級的暴力，包括汽油彈和爆炸品（“I was told the US is very concerned about new violence from demonstrators, increased threats from bombs/IEDs”），若有導致警察或市民死亡的話，便會使美國政府、國會和輿論疏遠運動，內部人士亦認同暴力對反修例運動構成嚴重威脅，既刺激北京亦失去美國政府的支持。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華指，黎智英曾提及過「國際游說的四個步驟」，其中之一是將外國的信息帶回香港，所以黎轉發這些訊息給他。陳又提到，當時「佢（黎）曾經講過勇武冇晒分寸，又冇組織嘅話，愈嚟愈濫用暴力，就會失去國際支持」，而上述訊息提及美國政府不想見到反修例運動愈來愈多暴力，正正是黎的關注點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳表示當時很想將訊息轉發給「攬炒巴」劉祖廸和李宇軒，因為劉與黎已經見過面，而劉清楚知道黎在國際線上的取態，但是他未必完全清楚美國政府的取態，所以便問黎能否轉發訊息給劉和李。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱攬炒團隊非勇武派-但採取兄弟爬山各自努力態度&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱「攬炒團隊」非勇武派 但採取「兄弟爬山，各自努力」態度&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問到，陳梓華當時會否視「攬炒團隊」是勇武派。陳表示他不會視「攬炒團隊」是勇武派，「佢對勇武派嘅態度係『兄弟爬山，各自努力』。」李官指，即是「攬炒團隊」視勇武派是「兄弟」，雙方追求同一個目標，但是採取不同的方法。陳指正確，「佢當時未必完全認同嗰啲好暴力嘅行動，但係佢唔會公開批評佢哋（勇武派），或者阻止佢哋。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對於「兄弟爬山，各自努力」，陳的理解是勇武派採取較激烈的手段，但「老泛民」則想用較溫和的手段，然而基於大家都是爭取「五大訴求」，所以不應互相批評。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到為何想轉發美國內部消息給劉祖廸和李宇軒，陳表示因為當時他們都「打緊國際線」，他希望劉等人知道美國政府的取態，即是「佢（美國）唔認為制裁係唯一嘅途徑」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指國際線人士有共識跟黎智英方向-所以告知黎大家都努力做緊嘢&quot;&gt;陳梓華指國際線人士有共識跟黎智英方向 所以告知黎「大家都努力做緊嘢」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年5月1日，陳梓華向黎智英傳送訊息，表示關心對方的健康狀況，又稱所有項目都正在進行中，他正努力地與各方聯繫（“All the projects still ongoing. Working very hard to liaise with different parties.”）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳解釋，「項目」是指「重光團隊」（Fight for Freedom, Stand with Hong Kong，簡稱 SWHK）的幾條線，包括美國線、由李宇軒牽頭的日本線，以及劉祖廸帶領的英國線和北歐線。陳向黎傳送這個訊息的目的是「想話畀佢知大家都努力做緊嘢」，但是因為當時有新冠疫情，所以面對很多困難。陳稱他在訊息中表示希望在疫情結束後，能與黎合作，即去外國會見政府官員或「枱底人」，以推動制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到為何要讓黎知道陳正在做什麼，陳指「因為我哋當時已經有共識所有人都會跟住佢（黎）方向」，加上他從 Mark Simon 或李柱銘口中得知黎生病了，所以想告訴黎當時國際線的情況。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英曾嘗試安排陳梓華等人赴台見唐鳳-惟最後沒成行&quot;&gt;黎智英曾嘗試安排陳梓華等人赴台見唐鳳 惟最後沒成行&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年5月，黎智英向陳梓華轉發訊息，顯示黎聯絡台灣《蘋果日報》社長陳裕鑫，嘗試安排「逆權運動年輕人陣營」到台灣與時任台灣行政院政務委員唐鳳和中華文化協會見面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳解釋，當時 SWHK 內部討論過發展台灣線，但是他當時聯絡不到黎的私人助手 Mark Simon，所以便直接聯絡黎智英，而黎問他們想不想見唐鳳和中華文化協會。陳當時並不知道唐鳳是誰，後來在網上搜尋資料後知道他是當時的台灣官員。惟最後他們沒有成行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;人大公布立國安法後-陳梓華籲黎智英小心自身安全因認為他有法律風險&quot;&gt;人大公布立國安法後 陳梓華籲黎智英小心自身安全因認為他有法律風險&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年5月21日，黎智英向陳梓華傳送人大公布實施《港版國安法》的新聞，並道：「仆街打到嚟喇！」陳之後回覆黎：「黎前輩：事情至今，已經難以逆轉形勢，我唯一擔心是你與 Martin 及你們家人的自身安全，萬事請以自身安全與事業存續為首要考慮。國安法主要針對境外內勇武人士，港獨份子及煽惑群眾人士。你務必謹慎。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳解釋，他當時認為黎有法律風險，「因為當其時佢已經係指示緊我哋去做呢個制裁，然後佢自己本身亦都呼籲緊唔同嘅人去對抗個政府，所以我當時認為，《國安法》若然要拉人嘅話，第一個就係黎智英。」而訊息中「事業」是指「民主嘅事業」，「自身安全」即是黎會否被拘捕。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英其後回覆陳，籲他不要擔心個人安危，一旦站出來爭取自由，便要作戰至最後一刻，雖然未必會勝利，但必須堅持下去，更好的日子即將會來臨：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Let’s not worry about personal security. Once came out to join the fight for freedom one is prepared to fight to the last. We may not win but must persist. Don’t worry. Better days will come.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳表示，他理解黎上述訊息中的「堅持」意思是繼續抗爭及推動制裁，至於黎使用「我們」是想談論整個國際線。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱黎智英李宇軒和劉祖廸等人在國際線上重要-為保留實力應在國安法之前離港&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱黎智英、李宇軒和劉祖廸等人在國際線上重要 為保留實力應在國安法之前離港&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華其後回覆黎，表示他沒有退後的餘地，他有責任盡量保留最多的實力，也不會放棄，「如果你們倒下了，我會是最後一個站著的人」，最好的情況即將來臨：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“There is no turning back for me and I do have a sense of duty to conserve our forces as much as possible. I won’t give up too. If all of you fall, I will be the last man standing. The best is yet to come.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳解釋，當時他認為如果黎和 Mark Simon 都被拘捕，只剩下他自己和李宇軒仍然在香港；然後如果李宇軒都被拘捕的話，那陳自己便是最後一個人，「我認為當時負責任嘅做法係，應該喺《國安法》之前將所有人送走，而我就係最後一個走，因為佢哋做咗好多嘢，而我一直都冇乜建樹。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問陳，為何在訊息中表示要保留實力。陳回答：「因為好似我咁做傳話嘅人，可以有好多人代替我，但係好似李宇軒、劉祖廸，甚或乎黎智英同埋 Mark Simon 呢種人，呢啲都係好難取代。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;庭上顯示黎回覆陳，所以陳及其手足都很重要，又形容這是一場持久戰，陳是勝利的希望：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“That’s why you and your comrades are so important. This is going to be a long war and you are our hope of victory.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;按陳的理解，黎的意思是陳、李宇軒、劉祖廸和其他SWHK團隊成員在國際線上很重要。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華傳送重光計劃眾籌資料給黎智英-冀黎幫忙宣傳&quot;&gt;陳梓華傳送「重光計劃」眾籌資料給黎智英 冀黎幫忙宣傳&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年5月28日，陳梓華向黎智英傳送一條「連登」討論區連結，題為〈【突發】攬炒過後是晨曦！攬炒團隊《重光香港計劃》眾籌上線！〉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳解釋，當時因為 SWHK 的資金即將耗盡，劉祖廸一直想籌辦多一次眾籌，惟李宇軒覺得時機未到。直至2020年5月中的時候，二人聯絡陳，表示決定推出眾籌，陳雖然同意做法，但同時提醒二人，「之前 Mark Simon 講過，唔好再登實體報紙喇，可以做其他嘢，尤其係國際游說」，於是大家便開始構思如何在眾籌入面撥出部份資源做國際游說。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，他們最後決定在眾籌用途新增多一個選項，例如「多元重光計劃」，使他們運用眾籌款項時可以靈活一些。陳亦指「多元重光計劃」意思是採取不同手段達到目的，即是推動制裁或是倡議經濟封鎖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於為何要把「連登」討論區連結傳送給黎，陳指「因為要報告返畀佢知我哋做過啲咩」，更重要的是，當時擔心有人對國際游說反感，所以希望黎智英能夠幫手宣傳眾籌計劃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華mark-simon建議李宇軒不應以個人名義加入ipac-因國安法後會成為目標&quot;&gt;陳梓華：Mark Simon建議李宇軒不應以個人名義加入IPAC 因國安法後會成為目標&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，大約於2020年5至6月，李宇軒說想以個人身份加入「對華政策跨國議會聯盟」（Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China，簡稱 IPAC），聯盟創辦人裴倫德（Luke de Pulford）想組織不同國家的議員，協助他們就對華政策作出更好的判斷和應對，包括考慮採用更強硬措施或制裁。「當時佢（李宇軒）淨係話有個國際嘅反華組織」，並問陳應該以個人名義加入，還是以 SWHK 的組織名義加入。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳徵詢 Mark Simon 意見之後，對方表示支持李加入 IPAC，但是若然李自己一個人加入，便「太過高調」，亦會得失當時的 SWHK 成員。此外，李在《國安法》生效之後可能「會成為目標，會好危險」，因此 Mark Simon 建議應該是整個 SWHK 加入 IPAC。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳稱他將 Mark Simon 的建議轉告李宇軒，李亦明白，後來整個 SWHK 以團體名義加入 IPAC。至於李的角色，陳指李一開始稱協助 IPAC 開設網站，但是「整整吓就做埋翻譯」，「同埋好似阿 Luke 嘅助手咁。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華赴壹傳媒大樓會見黎智英-黎稱英文版可使蘋果有國際話語權&quot;&gt;陳梓華赴壹傳媒大樓會見黎智英 黎稱英文版可使《蘋果》有國際話語權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年6月16日，陳梓華到達將軍澳壹傳媒大樓與黎智英會面。會面之前，陳由黎的私人司機接載往壹傳媒大樓，因為希望避開所有鏡頭，「佢（黎）亦都擔心畀人見到佢同年輕嘅抗爭者有聯繫，或者令我嘅身份曝光，咁佢都唔想。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指在會面期間，黎稱當時《蘋果日報》不斷蝕錢，所以需要商業上的支持；加上黎正在籌辦英文版，所以需要大量資金去營運：「佢（黎）當時話呢個英文版相當於一個國際版，就係畀外國人睇嘅。雖然係蝕錢，但係對於佢嚟講好有價值。」控方追問為何黎認為英文版有價值。陳則引述黎說，「如果《蘋果日報》有英文版嘅話，就可以好直接同埋好快咁畀到一手資訊，去畀外國嘅枱底人睇到，咁佢哋可以作出更加有利黎智英政治理念嘅判斷。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續解釋，外國的「枱底人」閱讀《蘋果》英文版的時候，可以得知《蘋果》所形容的香港及《蘋果》所提供的資訊，「咁會有預設嘅立場」，然後「枱底人」會就此寫報告給官員，去決定是否實施制裁或其他措施。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又引述黎說，英文版可以令《蘋果》由一個本地傳媒變成國際傳媒，「咁喺國際上面就更加有國際話語權，同埋會有更加多人關注。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華黎智英稱國安法雷聲大雨點小-揚言繼續在媒體上呼籲制裁&quot;&gt;陳梓華：黎智英稱國安法「雷聲大，雨點小」 揚言繼續在媒體上呼籲制裁&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，會面中二人談及《國安法》，他自己有表達憂慮，「我認為應該要褪（讓步）」，即是所有人不應該再繼續倡議制裁；「但係佢（黎）就係話，《國安法》雷聲大、雨點小，佢唔會有事嘅。佢話佢會以身作則，會繼續喺唔同嘅媒體上面呼籲制裁同埋關注。」陳引述黎籲「我都應該係咁」，又籲他叫其他人繼續在文宣和國際線上工作，以及要支持初選。惟陳當時回應黎「其實當時好難再做文宣」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;二人談及 IPAC，陳稱黎問他為何不加入 IPAC，「佢（黎）覺得 IPAC 好重要，一定要有呢啲國際支持，先會有用。」黎又提及他如何幫到年青人，「佢話佢已經同美國嗰邊傾緊」，惟黎未有詳述當中討論了什麼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至2020年7月，陳指 Mark Simon 告知他，「黎智英喺美國嗰度，喺 HKDC（香港民主委員會）嘅協助底下，咁就整咗個避風港法案。」陳解釋，該法案集中幫助年青抗爭者，「如果做咗政治犯之後呢，佢哋都可以喺美國嗰邊生活，所以年輕抗爭者可以繼續放心抗爭。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱初選構思者為黎智英-動用大量人脈媒體資源協助初選&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱初選構思者為黎智英 動用大量人脈、媒體資源協助初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示黎智英與陳梓華之間的 Signal 對話，2020年7月12日初選之後，陳向黎說，感謝他為初選所做的一切，形容這是香港歷史上重要的一頁：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Hi Jimmy, thanks for everything on the primary election. It’s remarkable on our HK history.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到為何傳送上述訊息，陳稱：「我諗我係少數人知道當初初選一直以嚟構思嘅係黎智英。」而且他認為初選「搞得好成功」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎在初選上做了什麼。陳則指黎動用了大量人脈，以及媒體資源去協助初選舉行。控方追問「動用人脈」的意思是什麼。陳稱當時並非所有人都同意初選的機制，以及爭議是否開放予所有人參與，「但係佢（黎）背後做咗好多功夫，最後促成咗初選。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;當控方追問黎做了怎樣的「功夫」時，陳則表示：「呢方面我唔清楚。」但他可以肯定的是，無論是與黎智英還是 Mark Simon 的會面中，「佢哋都不約而同、好具體咁講到，佢哋會用傳媒去支持政治素人去參加初選，令到成個初選更加有認受性。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The increased focus on countering kleptocracy following the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has involved the deployment of dedicated sanctions programmes against Russia by Ukraine’s allies. These programmes have triggered a dramatic increase in the rate of designations of individuals and entities and have led to a greatly increased commitment of resources and activity across a range of countries. This commitment also includes an increase in legislative, regulatory and operational capacity to enhance the response to modern kleptocracy more broadly. While the fight against kleptocracy did not start here, the shock of Russia’s unprovoked aggression confronted Western leaders with the reality of their apathy over preceding decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Modern kleptocracy” refers to acts of kleptocracy occurring in the modern financial age, particularly in the past two decades, benefiting from the globalisation of finance. There is no doubt that significant energy, time and resources have been deployed, overdue legislation has been introduced, and the lower evidentiary threshold of sanctions (rather than criminal prosecution) has been used to disrupt kleptocrats connected with the Russian government. However, this paper concludes that focus must be sustained to achieve the ultimate goal of confiscating assets and dismantling the architecture that facilitates kleptocratic activity, whatever its source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern kleptocracy is not unique to Russia. Funds stolen from national exchequers across the world, funds that should be spent on health care, education and sanitation, continue to find their way into real estate and other investments in Western financial centres. Governments must ensure that their efforts do not suffer from the tunnel vision brought on by a crisis and must instead facilitate long-term internationally coordinated and concerted action to combat modern kleptocracy in all its forms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calls for governments to take steps against kleptocrats are longstanding. Whether it is politicians highlighting the use of London, for example, as a playground for oligarchs and others who have amassed ill-gotten gains, or the exposure, through leaks such as the Panama Papers and the Luanda Leaks, of the enablers of illicit money movements, or dogged reporting by investigative journalists, the evidence against financial centres such as London, Panama and Cyprus has – in the eyes of most – been irrefutable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet until recently, despite these political calls and journalistic endeavours, little had been done to meaningfully address the problem. The past two decades in particular have seen the emergence of what might be termed “modern kleptocracy” – that is, kleptocrats operating with impunity, seemingly above the law and benefiting from the globalisation of finance. This persisted until Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, which both catalysed a wide coalition of nations to take action that targeted Russia-related kleptocracy, and laid the ground for a more concerted effort against kleptocracy more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “unprecedentedly tough” nature of the sanctions arrayed against Russia in the aftermath of the 2022 invasion is well documented. The sanctions are aimed at restricting the funding and resourcing of the Russian military and its illegal war of aggression. But wider consideration of the lessons that might be learned from this broad-based use of sanctions, and the introduction by Ukraine’s allies of other measures to target kleptocracy, is only now beginning to emerge. Some scholars are considering how the Russia sanctions regimes might inform future sanctions use against China, should circumstances in the Indo-Pacific escalate. Others are considering how assets belonging to oligarchs might be not only frozen but seized, for the benefit of Ukraine, while others are considering how to ensure that sanctions are sufficiently targeted to avoid disrupting trade and finance that supports genuine humanitarian activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper examines the response of Ukraine’s allies – including their use of sanctions – over the past two years in a wider perspective. The author hopes that this perspective offers those in policy circles who are currently focused on combating Russian kleptocracy ideas for how they might expand their ambitions to removing the appeal of international financial centres, not only for Russian kleptocrats, but for all those seeking to hide ill-gotten gains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper is composed of three chapters. Chapter I reviews the emerging response to kleptocracy in the years before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Chapter II highlights relevant elements of the sanctions regimes put in place by many of Ukraine’s allies since February 2022 to target Russian kleptocrats. Chapter III considers other mechanisms to combat kleptocracy that have emerged since Russia’s invasion. The paper concludes with recommendations for policymakers that might enable them to achieve a step change in responding to kleptocrats – and their wealth – that is long overdue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research for this paper draws primarily on a review of the literature on kleptocracy that has emerged over the past decade since the issue rose to contemporary prominence, and the literature on the action related to kleptocracy and corruption taken by governments before and after the February 2022 invasion. The literature review was conducted between November 2023 and January 2024. The paper also draws on the findings of a RUSI-led project on Russia-related sanctions implementation, which has been running since June 2022. The collected data was supplemented by half a dozen virtual interviews with subject-matter experts in the US conducted between January and February 2024 to clarify issues or seek further information relating to literature published by the interviewees. A validation meeting to discuss the paper’s preliminary findings with a group of government and non-government experts took place in Washington, DC in February 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-the-response-to-modern-kleptocracy-before-february-2022&quot;&gt;I. The Response to Modern Kleptocracy Before February 2022&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kleptocracy, defined as “a society whose leaders make themselves rich and powerful by stealing from the rest of the people”, is a longstanding and widely explored issue. It is not the place of this paper to provide a detailed analysis of the history, origin and semantics of this Greek-origin term; others have offered extensive explanations. But in the context of this paper, it is important to note that although the concept of kleptocracy is not exclusive to Russia, the collapse of the Soviet Union provided ample opportunity for the flourishing of the modern form of kleptocratic behaviour that has drawn the attention of politicians and civil society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether the context is the former Soviet Union, Africa, or other regions where high-level political power is allegedly abused for personal financial gain, the post-Cold War globalisation of finance has provided ample tools and opportunities for those seeking to profit from their positions of power to do so and create a form of kleptocracy for the modern financial age. Kleptocrats use the international financial system to hide their financial tracks and seek to use their wealth to exert influence for themselves or their political masters. The UK’s 2023 Economic Crime Plan underlines this, defining kleptocracy as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[A] highly corrupted political regime where power has been consolidated for the benefit of a small elite. It is characterised by widespread theft of national wealth and resources to subvert domestic political systems. Kleptocrats exploit open financial centres and professional services in developed economies to help corrupt elites enjoy their ill-gotten gains overseas … The UK is not unique in facing this threat, but as a global financial centre and popular destination for investment we have an important role in tackling it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, since the end of the Cold War, cities such as London have laid out the welcome mat for money – regardless of its provenance. Consider, for example, the 2011 establishment of the City of London–Moscow International Financial Centre Liaison Group, “heralding a new – and potentially lucrative – relationship between the two cities”, and the priority seems clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while the City of London, its professional service providers and real-estate agents, and those in other financial centres may have been courting this new and questionable money, politicians and policymakers have not been entirely inert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far back as 2000, under the leadership of Kofi Annan, the UN was starting its journey towards creating what became the UN Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC), which came into force in December 2005. And the Sustainable Development Goals agreed by the international community a decade later included the ambition to “significantly reduce illicit financial and arms flows, strengthen the recovery and return of stolen assets and combat all forms of organized crime” as well as “substantially reducing corruption and bribery in all their forms”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on this, and reflecting a speech he made in Singapore in July 2015 in which he asserted that “London is not a place to stash your dodgy cash” and that “[t]here is no place for dirty money in Britain”, in May 2016 then-UK prime minister David Cameron hosted a global anti-corruption summit. And whilst the word “kleptocracy” appears nowhere in the post-conference communiqué or declaration, the conference sentiment was clear: there should be no impunity for those who steal assets, and the countries present committed to restricting these people’s ability to operate in their countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the summit coming just a month after the revelations of the Panama Papers that exposed the abuse of company registration secrecy to hide asset ownership, one key outcome was for countries to commit to “enhancing transparency over who ultimately owns and controls [companies], [in order] to expose wrongdoing and to disrupt illicit financial flows”. Progress in this regard has been slow, but, nonetheless, by highlighting this important feature of combating corruption and kleptocracy, the stage was irrevocably set for a key piece of kleptocratic architecture to be dismantled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Cameron was making his case for tackling corruption and – by extension – kleptocracy, the US had already put in place operational measures to directly confront kleptocratic behaviour. In 2010, the US Department of Justice (DoJ) launched the Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative “aimed at combating large-scale foreign official corruption and recovering public funds for their intended – and proper – use: for the people of our nations”. This initiative has recorded considerable success in the period since it was created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside this law enforcement focus on kleptocracy, a number of policy developments in the US also put in place further measures for responding to kleptocracy. In 2016, FinCEN (the US financial intelligence unit, part of the US Treasury Department) issued Geographic Targeting Orders requiring certain businesses to identify the natural persons behind legal entities used in all-cash purchases of certain residential real estate in a list of US jurisdictions, a list that is continually expanding. These orders help authorities crack down on illicit financing schemes “exacerbated by a perception that real estate can be a safe way to park value and obfuscate the source of illicit funds”, and have proved valuable to a range of law enforcement agencies, although their failure to cover commercial real estate leaves an obvious gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A widely acclaimed landmark achieved in the US in 2016 was the passing of the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act. The Act authorises “the President to impose economic sanctions on, and deny entry into the United States to, foreign individuals or entities identified as engaging in human rights violations or corruption”, an authority that has subsequently been expanded via Executive Order 13818, and extensively used. Reflecting the US, one of the first steps taken by the UK to demonstrate its post-Brexit independent sanctions policy was the introduction of its own “global human rights” sanctions regime, followed in 2021 by a further regime targeting corruption with the purpose of “prevent[ing] and combat[ing] serious corruption”, including “misappropriation of property involving public officials”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these regimes provide important mechanisms via which the US and the UK can signal disapproval, bar t violators from entry, and draw the attention of the private sector to targets that should be frozen out of their financial systems, such designations do not always advance efforts to confiscate the proceeds of corruption, particularly when assets are not held within the reach of the sanctioning country. Indeed, at the time of introducing the UK’s anti-corruption sanctions, then-foreign secretary Dominic Raab pointed to the lower standard of proof required to issue sanctions as compared to the criminal standard required to prosecute – a suggestion that signalling matters, even if pursuing asset confiscation for the benefit of those countries from which kleptocrats have stolen funds proves challenging. Furthermore, in the case of the UK, despite this lower standard of proof, the use of its anti-corruption regime is widely viewed as underwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the EU has introduced a human rights regime, it has yet to bring forward an anti-corruption sanctions tool, despite calls from the European Parliament in 2021 and the proposal of European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen in 2022 to include corruption in the EU’s human rights regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second notable event in the US during this period was the passing of the Anti-Money Laundering Act 2020; this includes the Corporate Transparency Act, which requires FinCEN to create a federal-level beneficial ownership registry, a commitment that finally went live in January 2024. Bringing increased transparency to company ownership in the US is an important further step in the dismantling of the architecture of modern kleptocracy, and starts to bring the US into better alignment with the globally required standards of the Financial Action Task Force already in place among its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, the Biden administration has placed a particular focus on combating corruption, including designating the fight against corruption as a core US national security interest, targeting “the globe-trotting kleptocrat who offshores an embezzled fortune” and making extensive use of the various anti-corruption sanctions that authorities have introduced in recent years, with more than 40% of their use targeting kleptocrats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside these US policy developments, in June 2021, a bipartisan group in the US Congress announced the creation of the Caucus against Foreign Corruption and Kleptocracy (CAFCAK) to “educate and mobilize Members of Congress on the cross-jurisdictional nature of foreign corruption and identify bipartisan opportunities to work together to curb kleptocracy”. This group has acted as a focal point for a range of kleptocracy-focused legislative successes and the anchor for wider collaboration between like-minded individuals in legislatures on either side of the Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, although lagging behind the US on the development of sanctions, the EU has made consistent advances in identifying vulnerabilities in the integrity of its financial system and responding with repeated money-laundering directives. Most recently, in 2021 – and agreed between the EU Council and the European Parliament in January 2024 – the European Commission announced its latest, and most comprehensive, response to financial crime. A wide-ranging anti-money-laundering package brought forward a number of measures that will, among other things, strengthen the EU’s response to kleptocracy when fully implemented. For example, of relevance to combating kleptocracy, entities covered by regulation will be expanded from an existing list covering financial institutions, banks, real-estate agencies, asset management services and casinos to include traders in luxury goods and high-value items such as luxury cars, aeroplanes, yachts and artworks. Certain professional football clubs and related agents will also become subject to regulation. In addition, transparency of beneficial ownership, curtailed by the European Court of Justice in November 2022, shows signs of being restored, and real-estate registers across the EU will be made more easily accessible to competent authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, and returning to UK politics, since David Cameron’s short-lived engagement with the challenge of dirty money, the UK’s political leadership has chosen to (mostly) ignore the country’s role as a central facilitator of kleptocracy – but this is not to say that Parliament has too. Of particular note has been the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, which in 2018, following the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury, produced a scathing report that noted, despite the strong rhetoric from the government following the poisoning, that “President Putin and his allies have been able to continue ‘business as usual’ by hiding and laundering their corrupt assets in London”, and called on the government to “show stronger political leadership in ending the flow of dirty money into the UK”. This report, “Moscow’s Gold”, was supplemented by a further report from the Committee in the wake of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which shone a light on “The Cost of Complacency” by assessing “the consequences of the complacency of successive Governments towards illicit finance and the adequacy of the current Government’s response”, and starkly stated that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;London’s role as a global financial centre is tarnished by its reputation as a hub for illicit finance. The consequences for our national security and the integrity of our institutions and services are laid bare by the current war in Ukraine; assets laundered through the UK are financing President Putin’s war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In another example, the UK Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee, which provides parliamentary scrutiny of the intelligence and security activities of the UK intelligence community, published its Russia report in July 2020, which called, among other things, for immediate action to tackle “the illicit financial dealings of the Russian elite and the “enablers” who support this activity”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such calls from parliamentarians went largely unheeded until February 2022 and Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-ukraine-russia-sanctions-and-their-use-against-kleptocrats&quot;&gt;II. Ukraine, Russia Sanctions and Their Use Against Kleptocrats&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the response to modern kleptocracy covers a range of legislative, regulatory and operational measures, the immediate focus of Western allies following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine was on the use of sanctions, including targeting oligarchs and others who had long been the subject of calls for action from politicians and civil society campaigners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sanctions deployed by Ukraine’s allies have fallen into a number of categories. Initially, stung into action by the Kremlin’s invasion, Western countries deployed tried-and-tested financial sanctions, freezing the assets of individuals close to President Putin who, in the words of UK sanctions legislation, and consistent with that of other allies, were or had been involved in “obtaining a benefit from or supporting the Government of Russia” or in “destabilising Ukraine or undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine”. Allies also immobilised the assets of the Russian central bank and blocked access to the international financial markets for many of Russia’s financial institutions. In this initial phase, huge focus was placed on “the oligarchs” and their ostentatious wealth. Properties in London were frozen, yachts were seized in Mediterranean ports, and trophy assets such as football clubs were threatened with closure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as the war progressed, Ukraine’s allies realised that while freezing assets might restrict the Russian economy, it was difficulty in procuring critical components – including, importantly, the micro-electronics and technology needed for its missile and drone programme – that perhaps threatened the Russian military most severely. Thus, the focus of most sanctions activity has switched to trade rather than financial restrictions, with efforts to disrupt supplies of a list of 50 goods deemed critical for Russia’s military prioritised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does not mean that the focus on the oligarchs and their wealth has receded – indeed, the focus on trade has also directly impacted those oligarchs whose businesses are part of the Russian military–industrial complex. Ever since February 2022 and the first oligarch asset freezes, politicians and civil society activists have called on these assets to be not only frozen but also seized and used to benefit the Ukrainian people. In his State of the Union address in March 2022, President Biden committed to finding and seizing the “yachts” and “luxury apartments” of “the Russian oligarchs and the corrupt leaders who’ve bilked billions of dollars off this [Russian] violent regime”, concluding: “We’re coming for your ill-begotten gains.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considerable time and investment have been applied to reviewing legal means by which these assets can be confiscated within the bounds of “the rule of law”. As explored further below, new requirements have been introduced in the EU, reinforcing the reporting obligation where assets have been frozen to include assets that have not yet been frozen (for example, if they have been concealed), and including a requirement to report all “funds or economic resources belonging to, owned, held or controlled by [listed persons or entities] which are located within EU jurisdiction”, setting the stage for a more muscular anti-evasion and confiscation regime. A similar requirement was also introduced in the UK at the end of 2023. Perhaps most eye-catching of all, Canada has passed legislation that expands the country’s ability to confiscate assets where “a grave breach of international peace and security has occurred, gross and systematic human rights violations have been committed in a foreign state or acts of significant corruption involving a national of a foreign state have been committed”, opening the way for more expansive (though not as yet fully tested) confiscation activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While in Ukraine – a country at war – martial law has allowed for a widening of the criteria under which assets can be confiscated, to date, no solution has been found by which the Gordian knot of property rights and the rule of law can be sufficiently separated to allow for the large-scale asset confiscations called for by so many. Indeed, thus far, a mere $5.4 million, confiscated from oligarch Konstantin Malofeyev, has been transferred for the benefit of Ukraine, Malofeyev having been judged to have attempted to move money and evade sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, goaded into action by Russia’s war, political leaders and policymakers have set about building new structures and passing revised laws to strengthen the resilience of the financial system against kleptocratic abuse, and designing better responses for when these defences fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-widening-the-lens-in-the-response-to-modern-kleptocracy&quot;&gt;III. Widening the Lens in the Response to Modern Kleptocracy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this paper has shown, efforts to combat modern kleptocracy did not start with Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and they are not restricted to the use of sanctions. But it certainly is the case that the invasion accelerated responses to cases of Russian kleptocracy and made it no longer tolerable for those allies of Ukraine that had previously hesitated on taking action – for example, passing stronger legislation – to continue to do so. The resulting action has fallen into two categories: legislative and operational developments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;legislative-and-regulatory-developments&quot;&gt;Legislative and Regulatory Developments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the months that preceded the Kremlin’s full-scale invasion, Western leaders threatened “‘massive’ economic consequences” for Russia’s economy as soon as the “first Russian toe-cap” crossed into Ukraine. While sanctions did follow, Ukraine’s allies had to scramble to ensure their national legislation met their rhetoric, having underestimated the impact of applying economic and trade restrictions on a country so closely integrated into most Western economies. Many countries rushed to pass new legislation to allow for the effective implementation of sanctions and reorganised their national sanctions architecture to reflect their close ties with Russia. For example, Lithuania was quick to redraft its sanctions law, and in May 2022 it published an updated version that put the Financial Crime Investigation Service, the country’s financial intelligence unit, at the helm of sanctions implementation. Germany had to undergo a much deeper reform by completely overhauling its national anti-money-laundering system and establishing a dedicated Office for Sanctions Enforcement after two Sanctions Enforcements Acts. Many countries have yet, two years on, to introduce the legislation necessary to criminalise the growing prevalence of sanctions evasion, and none apart from the US have seized assets from oligarchs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding transparency, the EU suffered a significant blow at a critical time. In November 2022, the European Court of Justice ruled in favour of limiting public access to beneficial ownership registries. Some member states were quick to suspend access, whereas others, with legislation already in place to enable more universal access, maintained the registries’ operation. Recognising the damage caused by this ruling to the EU’s reputation and to efforts to identify and disrupt kleptocracy and wider financial crime activity, as noted earlier, in January 2024, the EU Council and the European Parliament agreed further steps that should once again allow members of the public with a legitimate interest, including media and civil society, to access the registries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the UK, while legislation for implementing sanctions was in place, the long-overdue reforms called for by parliamentarians were quickly rushed into legislation. In March 2022, the Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) Act 2022 was passed, giving effect to some key and much-needed tools for combating modern kleptocracy, including powers to accelerate sanctions decision-making (such as the introduction of an “urgent procedure” allowing the UK to fast-track designations to align with allies); strengthening the UK’s underwhelming and ineffective Unexplained Wealth Order regime; and, most importantly, establishing “a public register of beneficial owners of non-UK entities that own or buy land in the UK, operated by the Companies House registrar”. This last development paved the way for heightened transparency of property ownership in the UK, removing a widely used avenue for hiding the proceeds of modern kleptocracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late 2023, further legislation was passed, notably introducing powerful reforms to the operations of Companies House, the UK’s corporate register. Although this register has been open to public inspection for a number of years, the quality of the data it holds has repeatedly been revealed to be poor. A key component of this reform is the requirement for data held by the register to be verified, thus removing a loophole widely abused by kleptocrats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted earlier, Canada introduced legislation in May 2022 to enable the confiscation of assets in cases related to certain breaches of international peace and security. In the US, progress on implementing the Anti-Money Laundering Act 2020, including the Corporate Transparency Act, has continued, and while some striking new legislation has been introduced – such as the Foreign Extortion Prevention Act, which criminalises demand-side bribery by foreign officials – other critical anti-kleptocracy initiatives have foundered. Notably, in the face of strong opposition from lawyers’ groups, the failure of the bipartisan ENABLERS Act to secure Senate approval in December 2022 has left the US at odds with the wider international effort among its allies and partners to tackle the professional service providers that have been widely revealed to facilitate the illicit financial activities of the corrupt, kleptocrats and criminals by devising money-laundering and sanctions evasion schemes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, alongside introducing legislative changes aimed at more effectively operationalising sanctions implementation, EU countries have been bringing in new sanctions powers. In April 2022, Poland adopted its own Sanctions Act introducing a national sanctions list, and in October of that same year, Czechia approved its own Magnitsky law, joining Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia, which had already introduced their domestic versions prior to February 2022. The EU’s own directive on criminalising sanctions evasion is coming closer to introduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the legislative and regulatory armoury was being strengthened, so too was the operational response to modern kleptocracy, as countries – unilaterally and in partnership – created new entities to directly target Russian kleptocrats and their wealth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;operational-developments&quot;&gt;Operational Developments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the day of Russia’s invasion, as part of the package of response measures announced to the UK Parliament, then-prime minister Boris Johnson committed to “set[ting] up a new dedicated kleptocracy cell in the National Crime Agency (NCA) to target sanctions evasion and corrupt Russian assets hidden in the UK, and that means oligarchs in London will have nowhere to hide”. Reporting later in the year by the BBC revealed that the “K Cell” aims to “introduce friction” into the life of sanctioned oligarchs and other wealthy individuals with close ties to the Kremlin. This exclusive focus on Russia, as explored further below, draws attention to an important consideration in the fight against modern kleptocracy – the divide between the attention paid to Russian kleptocracy, and that paid to the proceeds of corruption and kleptocracy emerging from the many other affected geographies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the workings of K-Cell were revealed, a new dimension in the fight against modern kleptocracy emerged – particularly for countries with overstretched and under-resourced law enforcement capabilities. Whereas the success of law enforcement responses is normally judged by prosecutions, K-Cell takes the view that “changing behaviour is seen as success as much as an appearance in court”, claiming that intelligence is revealing that people are “choosing not to invest corrupt funds in the UK as a result of [the NCA’s] work”. There is also the suggestion that “enablers like lawyers may also become nervous of the reputational damage of working with sanctioned oligarchs”, although evidence of this behavioural change has yet to be presented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a similar development on the other side of the Atlantic in March 2022, with the US authorities announcing the launch of Task Force KleptoCapture, committing to “surging federal law enforcement resources to hold accountable corrupt Russian oligarchs”. In contrast to the UK’s K Cell, the Task Force made a clear commitment to seeking arrests and prosecutions via the use of the “most cutting-edge investigative techniques … to identify sanctions evasion and related criminal misconduct”. Since its launch, the Task Force has achieved the forfeiture of $5.4 million belonging to Russian oligarch Konstantin Malofeyev, noted above, and has “obtained judgments to forfeit nearly $700 million in assets from Russian enablers and charged more than 70 individuals for violating international sanctions and export controls levied against Russia”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the Task Force, the US 2021 Strategy on Countering Corruption rapidly took shape after February 2022. The 2022–26 Strategic Plans of the State Department, USAID and the DoJ all prioritised anti-corruption initiatives and increased their dedicated staff. In April 2022, FinCEN issued an advisory urging financial institutions to focus efforts on detecting the proceeds of foreign public corruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, recognising the cross-border nature of kleptocracy, these various national initiatives are seeking to coordinate and collaborate in their efforts to “detect and disrupt the movement of ill-gotten gains, and to deny [violators] the ability to hide their assets in jurisdictions across the world”, creating the so-called “Russian Elites, Proxies, and Oligarchs” (REPO) Task Force. Working alongside the REPO Task Force, the European Commission set up the “Freeze and Seize” Task Force to ensure the effective implementation of sanctions within the EU against Russian and Belarusian oligarchs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, as noted by one US government official, prior to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russia, cross-border collaboration on money laundering and other financial crime cases was sluggish. However, since February 2022, on cases related to sanctions evasion, there has been a marked improvement in the responsiveness and speed of requests from partner countries for information related to specifically Russian kleptocracy investigations, resulting in some notable law enforcement successes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to developments in the public sector, the raft of sanctions imposed on Russia after February 2022 completely redrew the perimeter of sanctions implementation for the private sector. Financial institutions have significantly boosted the resources of their sanctions compliance departments to deal with the breadth of the sanctions they are required to implement. This broad scope of the sanctions regimes has also meant that many non-financial businesses across different industry sectors have been exposed to sanctions obligations for the first time, requiring them to develop sanctions knowledge, hire staff and invest in screening resources – investements that should, in relevant sectors, be harnessed to further efforts to combat modern kleptocracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has sought to outline what lessons the international community has learned in its fight against modern kleptocracy from the response to two years of Russian aggression in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there has been considerable activity linked to Russia’s full-scale invasion, it is important to note that the past two years of effort have been limited in two ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The overwhelming focus of the measures developed over the past two years is on specifically Russian kleptocracy. While some initiatives – such as those aimed at greater transparency of property and company ownership – are universal in their application, the resources invested in investigating and prosecuting modern kleptocracy are almost exclusively focused on that emanating from Russia and associated with the Kremlin’s war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second limitation has to do with who is developing and enforcing these increased measures against kleptocracy. The measures are primarily restricted to those countries allied with Ukraine, and thus do not include countries that are noted facilitators of the illicit financial flows associated with modern kleptocracy, such as the UAE and Türkiye.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result is that the much-needed wider application of pressure against modern kleptocracy has been neglected, notwithstanding the introduction of new legislation (for example, relating to Companies House reform in the UK) and other measures (such as, in the US, the proposed broadening of regulation to cover investment advisers). A key indicator of this failure can be seen in the limited number of designations by the UK under its global anti-corruption sanctions regime in the last two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second important observation relates to outcomes. While oligarch assets have been frozen, little progress has been made on the investigations and evidence-gathering needed to secure asset confiscations, particularly in Europe, and prosecutions for sanctions evasion remain rare, despite ample evidence that evasion is occurring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UNCAC, a “legally binding universal anti-corruption instrument”, has formed a central pillar of global efforts to combat corruption and, by extension, the kleptocrats that abuse their connections with, or positions of, power since it entered into force in December 2005. Authorities in the US had been alive to the issue for over a decade since the Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative was formed by the DoJ as part of the US’s commitment to meet its obligations under UNCAC, and parliamentarians and their equivalents on both sides of the Atlantic had been seized of the matter, even if their leaderships had not. But finance is global, and where the US led operationally, other financial centres – including, notably, given its centrality to global finance, the UK – failed to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combating kleptocracy matters – not only, of course, for the countries from which funds are looted, but also for the national security of those countries to which the proceeds of kleptocracy flow. As the 2023 updated UK Economic Crime Plan notes, illicit finance linked to corrupt elites from Russia and other kleptocratic jurisdictions and hostile states undermines a nation’s reputation and enables broader national security threats such as the subversion of democratic processes and institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, political leaders have been shamed into action, passing long-overdue legislation and creating task forces and other initiatives in an attempt to make up for lost time. Whether they will succeed remains to be seen, but kleptocracy is not unique to Russia. Funds stolen from national exchequers across the world, funds that should be spent on health care, education and sanitation, continue to find their way into real-estate and other investments in Western financial centres. We should certainly strive to identify and confiscate ill-gotten gains from those that have supported and benefited from the patronage of President Putin, but so too must we ensure that the tools and mechanisms that have facilitated their financial dealings are no longer available to kleptocrats and the corrupt from elsewhere across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its 2023 Serious and Organised Crime Strategy, the UK government commits to “combat[ing] kleptocracy by improving financial sanctions design and implementing, enforcing and strengthening our response to kleptocracy”. But what does this mean in practice? And how can the legislative, regulatory and operational steps taken over the past two years and reviewed in this paper – born of a desire to address more than a decade of neglect – be solidified to ensure that the ability of kleptocrats to abuse Western financial services and investment markets can be curtailed once and for all?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper proposes the following actions for accelerating the fight against modern kleptocracy, based on the steps taken over the last two years, motivated by two years of Russian aggression in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sustain focus:&lt;/strong&gt; Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine triggered a strong response from Western allies related to specifically Russian modern kleptocracy, yet history shows that new crises (such as the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel and subsequent Israeli response) can quickly distract policymakers and divert law enforcement resources.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid tunnel vision:&lt;/strong&gt; While considerable resources have been dedicated to targeting specifically Russian kleptocracy via sanctions, reforms with broader application have been introduced. These must be leveraged to ensure that modern kleptocracy writ large is addressed and that efforts are not confined to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promote international cooperation:&lt;/strong&gt; International cooperation to combat modern kleptocracy has strengthened since February 2022. Initiatives established since the full-scale invasion must be formalised and expanded to respond to kleptocracy in all its forms, and not confined to Russia sanctions-related activity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhance operational capacity:&lt;/strong&gt; While some new resources have been introduced in Europe, capacity to respond to modern kleptocracy remains short of what is required to create a sustained and effective response.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthen legislation:&lt;/strong&gt; Countries have discovered that freezing kleptocrat assets is the easy part. Stronger legislation is required to support the investigation of modern kleptocracy, and thus ensure that assets are not only frozen but also confiscated and returned to their rightful beneficiaries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dismantle the enabling architecture:&lt;/strong&gt; Too much of the architecture that can be abused by kleptocrats (including corporate secrecy and professional enablers) is allowed to persist. Efforts to dismantle this architecture must be accelerated, and valuable legislative initiatives, such as the US ENABLERS Act, must not be allowed to fail.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take responsibility:&lt;/strong&gt; International financial centres must acknowledge that they fuel kleptocracy by offering the tools and expertise necessary to move and hide stolen funds. Thus, those responsible must work harder to use newly acquired legislative, regulatory and operational tools to remove the loopholes and vulnerabilities abused by kleptocrats. This includes the necessity of following through on enforcement via prosecutions and asset confiscations, rather than imposing sanctions as a sole solution.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support democratic resilience:&lt;/strong&gt; The fight against modern kleptocracy is a whole-of-society effort. All of society must be empowered in this fight.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has energised governments in their efforts to combat modern kleptocracy. Steps taken over the past two years have paved the way for greater success, but the focus must be sustained, broadened beyond Russian modern kleptocracy, and made permanent if these efforts are to bear fruit.&lt;/p&gt;

Borders could not stop the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, but Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine demonstrated that the kinds of national wars that characterized the 20th century were still relevant.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;Ideology has faded, and the states of the Global South have grown larger and wealthier. They now expect a larger share of the global pie. While cooperation has become more necessary, the world has entered an era of increased national contestation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this CSIS report, Jon B. Alterman and Lily McElwee argue that robust multilateral cooperation is central to creating opportunities and improving global conditions. Layers of organizations that bring together like-minded governments, businesses, and nongovernmental organizations across multiple venues and alliances will be necessary to tackle the complexity of today’s international challenges. The report draws from a series of meetings CSIS conducted with 30 senior experts around the world throughout 2022 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wars reveal fault lines in international relations. They raise stakes, they bring government decisions under greater scrutiny, and they force governments to decide whom to support and whom to oppose. Wars cause governments to appeal to other governments for aid, and when that aid is not forthcoming, governments’ actions — and inaction — send their own messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine was a clarifying moment. Over the previous three decades, economic integration had sharply increased around the world, global living standards rose dramatically, and connectivity blurred international boundaries and allowed billions of people to tap into almost limitless pools of information at almost no cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rapid spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, in some ways, was a consequence of that world. A disease that began in a provincial capital in China became a global phenomenon within weeks. National and international organizations mobilized to encourage the development and distribution of vaccines, and international financial institutions buttressed shaky economies. While the costs of the pandemic were astronomical — one estimate put its cost in the United States alone at $16 trillion — and supply chains were shattered, the pandemic did not force a breakdown in international ties, let alone anything resembling armed conflict. Many states felt abandoned by the international system, yet that system endured without deep scarring. China is the largest trading partner of 120 countries, and the United States is both an innovator and a norm-setter. Size insulated both. It was unthinkable not to seek ways to work with China to manage the consequences, frustration, and anger that the pandemic provoked, or to cut U.S. ties over dissatisfaction with vaccine distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, the Ukraine invasion was a sign that old patterns of conflict persisted. Tanks rolled and missiles flew. Soldiers died — as did tens of thousands of civilians. The United States worked to rally global support to push back on Russia, with mixed results. Much of Europe was enthusiastic about aligning with the United States on a threat to regional security, while China was circumspect about giving a boost to U.S. global hegemony. U.S. partners in Northeast Asia, such as Japan and South Korea, hewed closely to the U.S. line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for many governments — including many with close ties to the United States — the war in Ukraine was not their fight. Some, such as Israel and Turkey, had complicated relations with Russia that inhibited their action. But many others saw little advantage in being drawn into rising “great power” competition. These governments did not see Russia’s invasion as a violation of Ukrainian sovereignty that threatened the principle of sovereignty everywhere. Instead, many viewed it as part of a century-long shadow war between the United States and Russia, exacerbated by a reckless Ukraine. Others still saw it merely as a tiresome continuation of centuries of European warfare intended to nudge borders one way or the other. In this view, the insistence on stark national boundaries combined with the narcissism of small differences to make conflict inevitable, with states once again fighting to unite isolated minorities with their purported homeland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the United States proclaimed the importance of defending a rules-based order, these countries said they saw something more self-interested at stake: a U.S. effort to preserve decades-old advantages for the United States and its closest partners. They saw these advantages continuing to enrich a small number of countries at the expense of an increasingly populous, increasingly wealthy, and increasingly consequential fraction of the world’s population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not merely U.S. competitors who seek to portray the global order this way. Close partners to the United States increasingly question the indispensability of U.S. leadership, as well as its wisdom and durability. Decades of long and inconclusive wars, increasingly polarized U.S. politics, and ever larger oscillations between successive U.S. administrations’ foreign policies have led many governments to be more cautious. But another element is many governments’ insistence on recovering their own agency and on advancing their own self-interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While the United States proclaimed the importance of defending a rules-based order, these countries said they saw something more self-interested at stake: a U.S. effort to preserve decades-old advantages for the United States and its closest partners.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world today is at a crossroads. Rising global integration has exacerbated challenges that swiftly transcend borders. Disease, climate change, the trafficking of persons and goods, and informal migration are just a few of the issues that no government can solve in isolation. Similarly, an increasing number of economies are tied to changes in transportation, communication, and finance that elide distance and connect cosmopolitan centers to remote villages and everything in between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, despite closer ties, we also have entered a new period of national contestation. While greater connection is broadly irreversible, the terms of those connections, the boundaries of acceptable behavior, the structures of coordination, and the methods to resolve differences and enforce agreements are all increasingly in question. Great powers have given up the struggle over ideology, which consumed the middle of the twentieth century. Yet, they struggle to control norms of international behavior as much as they ever did. Equally importantly, although the world’s largest economies remain dominant, rising powers have a greater share of money and influence than ever before. They are increasingly assertive in their efforts to reshape the international order and to take their own measure of what advances their interests, irrespective of the demands of great power partners — and especially of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The structures needed to handle this emerging reality will be even more complicated and cumbersome than those that emerged at the end of World War II. Rather than tightly integrated blocs of states bound by mutual treaty obligations, we are moving toward a world in which each state must coordinate a wide range of overlapping ad hoc ties. While this system produces more friction, it also holds the promise of bringing every country into a web of interlocking relationships. For the United States and its partners, the challenge is not to resist this trend, but rather to ensure that the benefits of this comprehensiveness compensate for the complexity of these networks and the efforts required to maintain them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report will begin with an overview of the frameworks for internationalism and international cooperation, many of which have roots that are centuries old. It will then consider the strategies that great power competitors have adopted to limit the constraints that internationalism might place on their actions. The discussion then turns to the growing salience of the Global South: not only are such countries gaining in income, population, and power, but their cooperation is necessary to address a widening array of global issues. Alternative structures for international cooperation are considered, as is the potential incorporation of nontraditional participants into multilateral cooperation (such as nongovernmental organizations and the business community). After a brief consideration of the strategic shape of the future, the paper concludes that much more robust engagement across a range of modalities would deliver better outcomes for all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-origins-of-internationalism&quot;&gt;The Origins of Internationalism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multilateral institutions are a recent innovation. Early multilateral efforts such as the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia and the 1814 Congress of Vienna were exercises in conflict management with a narrow remit on issues of warfare, and neither did much to coordinate European powers’ pursuit of common interests. Yet, sharply increased communication, travel, and trade in the nineteenth century forced new modalities. The International Telegraph Convention in 1865 and the Universal Postal Convention in 1874 helped integrate communications networks. The First International Sanitary Conference in 1851 was a European effort to standardize quarantine regulations against the spread of cholera, plague, and yellow fever, in a clear recognition of the importance of international cooperation in combating contagious disease. The latter effort took four decades, as periodic gatherings of scientists and diplomats finally led to an agreement to notify fellow member states of disease outbreaks and to comply with internationally recognized disease prevention procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The innovation here was that the resultant agreements legally bound the signatories, each of which benefited from the compliance of the whole. While accession was mostly limited to Europe, the expansive global footprint of Western powers gave even intra-European sanitary efforts global impact. In addition, many of these early agreements and conventions created durable institutions for follow-up, enforcement, and further cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A trend toward “structural” multilateralism, which created legally binding obligations on participants, picked up after World War I. International conventions on topics such as narcotics, trafficking in persons, citizenship, and trade then led to binding agreements. But it was in the decades following World War II that structural multilateralism really took off. From the ashes of a war that was genuinely global, a flurry of treaty-based international organizations was created that aspired to be genuinely universal. The UN General Assembly was the most sweeping of them, but agreements and institutions flourished, expanding their reach in issues from public health to economics to aviation, both within UN-affiliated structures and well beyond them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Coalitional internationalism” grew in the same period. These more flexible modes of international engagement allow groups of countries to coordinate efforts to advance individual and collective preferences outside the constraints of treaty-based multilateral institutions. The first G-grouping, the G7 group of market democracies, was initiated in 1975, and it provided an avenue for ideologically like-minded and economically compatible countries to bring their political leaderships together. Twenty-four years later, in the wake of the Asian Financial Crisis, the G20 brought together finance ministers and central bankers from the world’s 20 largest economies. In 2009, it began to gather political leaderships, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some coalitions are even more ad hoc. Indeed, the George W. Bush administration hailed its “coalition of the willing,” encompassing the countries offering either military or political support during the 2003 war in Iraq and the subsequent U.S. military presence there. The United States has been an especially effective convener of such ad hoc groups. As Stewart Patrick has written, informal arrangements outside multilateral institutions provide the “world’s most powerful country . . . greater maneuvering room and control over outcomes” than formal multilateral institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The great strength of structural internationalism is found in its normative qualities. International organizations embody values and teach them forward to new leaders. Yet, that same structure simultaneously creates weakness, as these institutions are only as strong as the signatory states are willing to tolerate. Powerful signatory nations determine in advance what remit they will tolerate in the new institution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These same institutions have also succumbed to a creeping brittleness over time. Treaty-based international institutions rarely reopen the founding framework to adapt to changing power dynamics in the world. For example, the UN Security Council still awards veto rights to the same five countries it did three-quarters of a century ago, representing the victorious powers in World War II. Those five countries did represent the center of mass of geopolitical power in 1946. But while the rise of new global and regional powers — Japan, Germany, India, and Brazil, just to name a few — brings a new power geometry, the Security Council remains frozen in time. In the views of one close observer, “To a growing proportion of the world’s governments and citizens, the council today is both feckless and unjust, dominated by irresponsible and unrepresentative powers inclined to abuse their position rather than safeguard the peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In the views of one close observer, “To a growing proportion of the world’s governments and citizens, the council today is both feckless and unjust, dominated by irresponsible and unrepresentative powers inclined to abuse their position rather than safeguard the peace.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;objections-from-great-power-competitors&quot;&gt;Objections from Great Power Competitors&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even to those who are super-empowered by the post–World War II institutions, those institutions’ arrangements can appear problematic. While one can argue that they have given primacy to both China and Russia — especially in the case of the UN Security Council — both countries remain wary of a world in which U.S. wealth and military strength, when combined with that of Europe, gives the United States hegemonic power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, what many in the United States have come to refer to as the “rules-based international order” is, in practice, the postwar, U.S.-led liberal order. It was united by three things: overwhelming U.S. global power, a U.S. commitment to ensure that benefits were widely shared among its adherents, and a durable threat to that order by an ideological challenger with universal aspirations. For U.S. allies and partners, the United States and the system it advanced served as both a benefactor and protector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because both Moscow and Beijing appear convinced that — even after the end of the Cold War — U.S. strategy remains predicated on seeking their weakness and isolation, each has adopted a three-pronged strategy: to aggressively defend their interests in existing multilateral organizations, to invest in newer multilateral organizations that exclude the United States from membership and in which they have relative primacy, and to align more closely with what they see as a “rising Global South” and enlist those countries in an effort to challenge U.S. hegemony. The stated goal of this behavior is not so much to undermine global order writ large as it is to ensure that the order that emerges is not a unipolar, U.S.-led one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ENSURING THEY ARE NOT A TARGET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first prong of that effort has deep roots. Cold War skirmishes colored the early days of the Security Council, and difficulties resolving the Berlin blockade in 1948–1949 were an early indicator that the council “was not likely to be an operational body.” Division persisted through four decades, although the end of the Cold War and the global response to 9/11 created an unprecedented sense of common purpose among the great powers. That sense of optimism crashed with the Arab Spring in 2011. In the early days of the Libyan civil war, in response to the Qaddafi regime’s use of lethal force against civilian protestors, the Security Council authorized a no-fly zone over Libya, as well as “all necessary measures” to protect civilians and civilian-populated areas. It was the council’s first authorization of military force based on the responsibility to protect (RTP) doctrine. Vigorous lobbying by important regional bodies such as the Arab League and the African Union persuaded Russia and China to abstain, rather than veto the resolution in March 2011. But Moscow and Beijing soon regretted their unexercised vetoes, given the scope of NATO’s ensuing air campaign and what they saw as a clear end goal of toppling Qaddafi’s government. For these capitals, U.S. enthusiasm to support citizens rebelling against an authoritarian government was both naïve and threatening: naïve because the United States did not appreciate how the crushing of governments would unleash radical forces, and threatening because they identified with the authoritarian governments that swiftly fell. They had learned their lesson and would no longer leave the United States and its partners a loophole to wage war under UN sanction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted earlier, the West’s focus on the Russian war in Ukraine has heightened global divisions. In March 2022, a Russian-sponsored Security Council resolution demanding civilian protection and unhindered humanitarian access in Ukraine was only able to garner Chinese support. Thirteen other Security Council members abstained and defeated the measure, arguing that the most straightforward way to relieve civilian suffering was for Russia to end its assault on Ukraine. Russia has complained loudly of a double standard, since the United States and its allies went into Iraq in 2003 absent a UN mandate. But this complaint has aligned with a resentment throughout much of the world that Ukraine garners so much attention and resources from the West, while the rest of the world’s problems — from security to economics to refugees to disease — are seemingly neglected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has been more circumspect in its efforts to engage in the United Nations. It has joined about half of Russian vetoes in the Security Council since 2000 (generally on Syria), and it has not cast any vetoes independently since that time. Unlike Russia, which has pursued a visible course of confrontation and disruption, China has worked assiduously to develop what some analysts call “discourse power.” That is, China seeks to have phrases that the Chinese Communist Party favors — such as “shared future” and “win-win cooperation” — incorporated into UN documents, while lining up countries to support noninterference in China’s internal affairs. As James Kynge wrote in the Financial Times in August 2023, “rather than seeking to create a whole new order, Beijing’s aim is to repurpose the UN’s authority to more squarely serve China.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In so doing, China’s approach is to defang the United Nations and to make it a friendlier venue for Chinese power. What is notable about China’s efforts, especially in contrast to Russia’s, is China’s seeming interest in inserting its ideas into the UN process rather than bending the organization to its will. In this way, China seeks to legitimize alternate paradigms of governance and human security that in turn legitimize China, rather than seek to delegitimize efforts that the Chinese see as seeking to delegitimize China. The value proposition, from a Chinese perspective, is that many developing countries gain legitimacy through these Chinese-supported paradigms and see them as ammunition against Western hegemony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arguably, China’s actions serve to resurrect patterns of relations that prevailed in East Asia for centuries. According to one account:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Sovereignty,” when the term is applied in Asian history, was mostly divisible, layered, and relative, as were allegiance, loyalty, and subjection. So the package that comes with the modern concepts and language of sovereignty, statehood, legitimacy, and the like impedes real understanding of the past and often only serves to legitimize political agendas in the present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seen through this prism, China is not seeking to displace the United States but rather to build support for an order that plays to Chinese strengths, gives China primacy in its near abroad, and allows for ambiguity in ways that increase Chinese power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China is not seeking to displace the United States but rather to build support for an order that plays to Chinese strengths, gives China primacy in its near abroad, and allows for ambiguity in ways that increase Chinese power.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ENHANCED MULTILATERALISM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second prong of Beijing’s and Moscow’s approach is to pursue a wide range of newer multilateral groupings — BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the Collective Treaty Security Organization, and a whole range of others. Generally centered in Asia, these organizations work on issues running the gamut from security to trade. While some incorporate U.S. allies and partners, none are centered around them, and they have the collective impact of creating organizations where U.S. influence is only indirect (if it exists at all). One could argue that these are both the appropriate and necessary counterparts to the sorts of U.S.-led institutions — starting with NATO and continuing to the World Bank and beyond — that the United States has created for three-quarters of a century. One could also argue that such organizations are focused on issues and countries that the United States and its closest partners neglect but that are nevertheless important to participants. Of course, their incorporation of countries that the United States and its allies sanction — not only Iran and increasingly Russia, but also several countries in Central Asia — helps reduce these countries’ isolation. The steady expansion and invigoration of such organizations in recent years has the effect of diminishing U.S. global predominance even if it does not necessarily enhance Russian and Chinese influence. For both Russia and China, even that can represent a win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALIGNMENT WITH THE GLOBAL SOUTH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third prong may be the most potent, and that is to seek alignment with rising powers that are deeply dissatisfied with the global status quo. Many in the Global South have come to resent what they see as the presumptiveness of wealthier nations. This attitude was well-captured by a remark the Indian minister of external affairs made in Bratislava in early June 2022: “Europe has to grow out of the mindset that Europe’s problems are the world’s problems, but the world’s problems are not Europe’s problems.” Former Indian national security adviser Shivshankar Menon argued in a recent piece in Foreign Policy that for many states in the Global South, “the existing order does not address their security needs, their existential concerns about food and finances, or transnational threats such as climate change.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Many in the Global South have come to resent what they see as the presumptiveness of wealthier nations.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, there is a widespread sense that Western powers have used the status quo to advance their own narrow interests. As a former Arab foreign minister remarked, “The West, with America at its lead, basically believed it has the right to American exceptionalism, and it has used force outside of its borders much more than anybody else over the years, and frequently without any legal basis.” Resentment of a double standard has manifested itself in complaints about Western support for Israel as it sought to push Hamas from Gaza in the autumn of 2023. Many in the Global South saw the war as yet another attack on Palestinians, with scant attention to international humanitarian law or the laws of war. Seen this way, Western states emphasize these rules only when they serve Western interests and conveniently ignore them when it suits their purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sanctions policy is another area where many states in the Global South believe that Western-led efforts to enforce global rules are merely a cover for advancing narrow Western interests. As sanctions have emerged as an increasingly important part of the Western tool kit to shape international behavior, the growing instinct among a widening array of countries is to find ways to circumvent sanctions (either through explicit sanctions evasion or through efforts to develop payment methods that do not touch dollar-based institutions and are thus insulated from U.S. enforcement efforts). Chinese-Iranian trade is strong, and China is the destination for about two-thirds of Iranian oil exports. In the Ukraine case, we see not only robust Russia-China trade despite U.S.-led sanctions against Russia, but also steep increases in Russian trade with India, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates. While these countries argue that, rather than taking the Russian side, they are preserving their neutrality, the assertion of neutrality in the face of Western unanimity to advance norms and values undermines the centrality of those norms and values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid sentiment that global institutions are ineffective in addressing the world’s most important challenges — and that the countries empowered by those institutions contributed to creating those problems in the first place — China and Russia invoke their own narratives of struggle against the wealthier nations of the West and sharpen their own grievances. Even if not seen as either exemplars or saviors, Russia and China can build some currency with states that share their distrust of Western intentions and their suspicion that Western prescriptions will leave them permanently lagging behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-salience-of-the-global-south&quot;&gt;The Salience of the Global South&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plainly put, the support of countries in the Global South is vital to the world’s ability to address a widening array of global problems. The complexity and interrelationships of global challenges, expanding economies, rising mobility, and the sheer population of the nations making up the Global South make them vital partners. Yet, many factors conspire to undermine cooperation: the Global South’s lingering historical grievances, a strong belief in the continued unfairness of the distribution of wealth and power, and a concern that the Global North’s regulations will sabotage the Global South’s urgent need for economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a time of rising great power tensions, the North-South divide can serve both to exacerbate global challenges and undermine efforts at collective action to address shared priorities. Yet, while the Global North often considers the Global South an exception, for most people in the world, the Global South is the norm. It constitutes some 80 percent of the world’s population and an increasing share of the global economy. Whereas in 2000 the countries constituting the Global South represented about 40 percent of world GDP, the OECD estimates that the global economy was equally divided in 2010, and the Global South will constitute almost 60 percent of world GDP in 2030. Large populations in India and China are a driver here, and governments in both places have lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty. These countries are not wealthy, however, and wealth as it has become known in the Global North may perpetually elude them. In fact, the number of countries that have followed Western patterns of development and economic growth in the last century and achieved wealth as a consequence is small.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 1970s and the years since, leaders in the Global South have accused bankers from the Global North of profiting while millions of their countrymen continue to toil. As they see it, a generally impoverished Global South provides raw materials and cheap manufactured goods to the Global North, while scarce southern funds flow north for technology and services that the Global North insists are necessary to compete internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China, especially, has sought to enhance its reputation as a country that brought hundreds of millions out of poverty by following its own star. Keenly conscious of the country’s “century of humiliation” at the feet of many of the same global powers that retain influence in the global system today, China puts forward its remarkable growth over the last 30 years as a model and inspiration for its partners. In addition, China’s emergence as a “near peer” to the United States despite very different values, political systems, and economics represents to many a crack in the purported monopoly of G7 countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BEYOND THE G7 PURVIEW&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For countries with established global leadership, many of their most vexing problems intimately link the Global North with the Global South and will require broader engagement between them. Migration is one such issue. Disease, climate change, and economic despair all drive people to leave what they know and seek better lives elsewhere. For some in the Global North, large immigrant communities from the Global South represent an incipient threat, bringing crime and extremism and threatening national cohesion. At the same time, some of those leaving the Global South are among the most highly skilled and trained of their population. They can gain entry to wealthier countries, earn higher pay and benefits, and enjoy a brighter future than in their countries of birth. As a consequence, their departure can make it harder for the Global South to develop local solutions, and it can perpetuate the Global South’s dependency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;For countries with established global leadership, many of their most vexing problems intimately link the Global North with the Global South and will require broader engagement between them.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, a much larger fraction of the displaced never make it out of their own country, or out of neighboring states. The United Nations estimates that, at the end of 2015, more than 85 percent of the world’s 16 million refugees, and more than 90 percent of the 64 million people forced from their homes around the world, remained in their regions of origin. Overwhelmingly, those areas of war and displacement are located in the Global South. And while states in the Global South are legally bound by international norms on refugee treatment — including but not limited to the principle of non-refoulement, which bars the forcible return of refugees — they have no leverage to elicit support from northern states to abide by their respective normative obligations. Put quite simply, the “stronger actor has little direct interest in cooperating, and the weaker actor has so little bargaining power that it can either accept what is offered or disengage entirely,” in this case taking “what is offered or simply harm[ing] themselves by refusing all assistance for the refugees they host.” Their option is to appeal to other interests of the Global North. The most obvious is allowing an increase in irregular migration, which has its own political impacts in destination countries. Appealing to destination countries’ security interests that the origin countries can hold at risk is also in play. What is clear is that this is an area of tension that needs to be managed — between wealthier states that wish to keep the bulk of the challenge at arm’s length and poorer states that feel they bear the brunt of the burden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ADAPTATION, LOSS, AND DAMAGE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many middle- and low-income countries, the unfolding of the global energy transition is a manifestation of their disenfranchisement. Resentful that wealthy countries became wealthy without any constraints on their emissions (and oftentimes while exploiting raw materials in the developing world), some complain that they, too, should be allowed to pursue industrialization and urbanization at the lowest possible cost, irrespective of emissions. As they look at the increased costs of electrifying their economies, reducing agricultural burning, cleaning up industries, and moving away from domestic coal and toward either imported fuels or renewable infrastructure with imported components, they feel entitled to financial support for their economies to transition to a low-carbon future. In addition, many seek external support for adaptation — that is to say, making their countries survivable through a period of greater weather extremes, which they see as brought on by centuries of rampant emissions growth from the world’s wealthiest economies. A 2009 UN commitment to “mobilize” $100 billion per year for developing countries, set to expire in 2025, fell well short of its goal, but also well short of projected needs. According to a recent UN analysis, “developing countries require at least $6 trillion by 2030 to meet less than half of their existing Nationally Determined Contributions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large as these numbers are, another issue is liability for losses and damages suffered as a consequence of climate change. For example, 2022 floods in Pakistan alone may have inflicted $40 billion in losses, destroyed more than two million houses, and damaged 13,000 km of roads. Every study suggests that the worst is yet to come. One estimate calculates that loss and damage from climate change in the developing world will total between a half-trillion and one trillion dollars by 2040, and between $1.1 and $1.7 trillion by 2050; an even more expansive study puts the toll at $4 trillion by 2030. And those are just the fiscal costs. A growing body of work seeks to assess the non-economic sources of loss and damage, including loss of territory, cultural heritage, indigenous knowledge, biodiversity, and a host of other factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For affected states, the math is compelling. Pakistan contributes less than 1 percent of global carbon emissions, yet it is at profound risk for catastrophic loss due to climate change. Similarly, Africa contributes less greenhouse emissions than other continents, but 1.2 billion Africans are among the people most susceptible in the world to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At issue, then, is not merely what countries will do to restrict their carbon emissions. There are a whole host of questions of who will pay the cost of adopting new energy systems, who will pay for adaptation to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters, who will pay the costs of natural disasters (and who will determine which of those have human causes, and how much of a role human activity played), and how countries will be compensated for other forms of loss that they suffer. Many wealthier countries argue that they not only have their own impressive climate-related costs to pay but have also already put billions of dollars into developing countries. At least some argue that “one reason people living in poor countries remain especially vulnerable to climate change is because government thievery and incompetence have held back the economic growth,” and that even if there were a large financial commitment by wealthier states, “very little of the money would likely reach the citizens who are suffering the brunt of weather disasters.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No formula can resolve the host of issues that have disproportionate impact in the Global South, and there will continue to be significant disagreement over the terms of their resolution. As the Global South gains in income, population, and power, however, its voice in the handling of those issues will rise. Up to now, Russia and China have put significant efforts into cultivating support in those states, arguing that what they need is a departure from the status quo that the United States and its allies and partners have imposed. The resultant solidarity gives some benefit to the affected states, while also providing benefit to Russia and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;other-forms-of-cooperation&quot;&gt;Other Forms of Cooperation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Important and populous though the rest of the world is, the world’s largest economies — and its largest military powers — retain outsized influence in global affairs, and they have a unique ability to genuinely threaten each other’s security. In recent years, many have proposed that major powers — including but certainly not limited to the United States and China — create an ongoing process of dialogue and consensus building. The Concert of Europe inspired one suggestion, put forward by then–Council on Foreign Relations president Richard Haass, that “concert members recognized their competing interests, especially when it came to Europe’s periphery, but sought to manage their differences and prevent them from jeopardizing group solidarity.” Haass and coauthor Charles Kupchan envisioned a permanent headquarters with representatives from China, Russia, the United States, India, Japan and the European Union, along with observers from four regional organizations: the African Union, the Arab League, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and the Organization of American States. Their goal was creating a system that provided both “political inclusivity and procedural informality,” eschewing both the democracy-promoting inclusivity of the G7 and the sometimes-excruciating diplomatic exactitude of the G20, to create “major power consensus on the international norms that guide statecraft.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harvard professors Dani Rodrik and Stephen Walt put forward another proposal, in which major powers would agree to place issues in one of four buckets: prohibited actions, actions in which states agree to alter their behavior in exchange for others’ altered behavior, actions which states can take unilaterally, and actions whose efficacy requires broad multilateral compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both proposals seek to build some guardrails around areas of mutual cooperation, ensuring that competition among major powers — let alone antagonism — does not undermine actions that advance mutual benefit. Yet, in periods of sustained conflict and low trust, countries tend to ascribe malign intent to even benign initiatives of their adversaries. This is in part because countries tend to see themselves as the central focus of adversaries’ foreign policies, and thus see adversaries’ efforts to thwart them as the central motivation of their actions. But it is also because, in low-trust environments, agreements are presumed to contain loopholes and trapdoors that advantage adversaries at their expense. While a focus on advancing shared interests is constructive — and, frankly, at the core of every diplomat’s tool kit — it is unrealistic to think that any single organization or dialogue structure can make significant headway between major powers when they are at loggerheads. Similarly, when there is general comity between major powers, the utility of a single structure amid myriad engagements is also diminished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even so, the idea of putting boundaries around national behavior is constructive. Especially promising areas to explore are those surrounding dual-use technology, autonomous weapons systems, and the weaponization of financial instruments. While competition in some of these areas is desirable and can drive innovation, unconstrained rivalry is more likely to be destabilizing. Putting limits on what governments will do, and creating confidence that those limits will be observed, reduces tensions and slows escalatory spirals. Yet, beneficial as such actions are, they need to be merely a piece of a much larger set of efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLURILATERAL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ambition can be a rare commodity in the multilateral sphere. Washington’s frequent instinct, as well as the instinct of many allies, is to make moderate reforms to existing institutions and arrangements in order to make them fit for purpose. Yet, the reform process is fraught. Meeting the aspirations of rising powers while reducing the U.S. ambit as well as that of its closest allies requires both sides of the equation to make what they consider to be significant concessions. Doing so when great power competition is the prevailing paradigm creates strong disincentives for such action. It is not a promising environment for ambitious adventures of diplomatic architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It is not a promising environment for ambitious adventures of diplomatic architecture.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More worthwhile is an effort to supplement the existing system, enveloping it in a web of complementary, sometimes overlapping, and often less-formal arrangements. In a way, this represents an effort to supplement twentieth-century agreements with additions that are more reminiscent of the nineteenth century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have already been efforts to invigorate what might be called “plurilateralism,” in which states set up smaller, more flexible, voluntary, and often temporary arrangements to break down complex cooperation problems and address specific governance challenges. Coalitions vary greatly in size, function, and format, and they address discrete problem sets and issue areas in which interested parties have a stake. Former Indian national security adviser Shivshankar Menon has called this growing form of internationalism “coalitions of the willing and able,” reflecting the fact that coalition members often have both an interest in addressing the shared challenges at hand and a willingness to devote resources toward them. When working well, informal arrangements enable swift cooperation on shared challenges — something in increasingly short supply within treaty-based multilateral forums. Smaller groupings mean fewer diverging interests at the negotiating table, which arguably makes it easier (and quicker) to define agendas and set goals in discrete areas of global problem solving. And because membership can be tailored to those with an interest in the issue at hand, states often come to the table with greater willingness to negotiate solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plurilateral coalitions have become more common across multiple domains of international problem solving, particularly as the prevalence and visibility of transnational issues has grown and geopolitical tensions and recalibrated modes of international engagement have made more formal arrangements less effective. In the environmental realm, for example, informal “climate clubs” are gaining traction as the international climate agenda expands and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) — the chief multilateral body for environmental negotiations — faces gridlock. Some groupings are designed to enable stronger international agreements. The Major Economies Forum of Energy and Climate Change (MEF), for example, was formed in 2009 to facilitate negotiations among developed and developing economies on the minimum required contributions necessary to make the 2010 UN Copenhagen climate summit successful. The MEF — which includes China, the United States, and other major polluters — has resumed meeting under the Biden administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coalitional governance in global health has also grown, especially in light of gridlock in the WHO made evident by the Covid-19 pandemic. In March 2021, for example, the “Quad” grouping of four maritime democracies across the Indo-Pacific (the United States, Australia, Japan, and India) established a vaccine partnership to assist countries in Asia with their Covid-19 pandemic responses, expand vaccine manufacturing, and administer 1.2 billion vaccinations globally. Meanwhile, under Beijing’s chairmanship in 2022, BRICS — Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa — launched a vaccine R&amp;amp;D center aimed at deepening cooperation in pandemic prevention as well as vaccine development, production, and distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the economic domain, too, coalitional approaches are on the rise. The G20, formed in 1999 as a coordination mechanism among major global economies, held its first summit in 2008 as the world plunged into the largest financial crisis since the Great Depression. By choice, states in the former G8 began investing in the G20 as the “premier forum for . . . international economic cooperation,” recognizing that avoiding global crises (economic and otherwise) would require coordination among a wider set of states. China has been active in coalitional arrangements in this sphere. In 2013, it launched the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to support infrastructure development overseas and expand and coordinate its bilateral economic partnerships, along with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), to put its stamp on regional infrastructure financing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The informal and ad hoc nature of coalitional arrangements can facilitate problem solving. For example, while China (now the largest creditor to developing nations) has refused to join the Paris Club — an informal group of mostly Western official creditors that has met regularly since 1956 to address repayment challenges faced by debtor countries — it recently joined Paris Club members in a new initiative, the Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable, to discuss coordination on sovereign debt restructuring and debt sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global cooperation is arguably most effective when pursued as a set of concentric circles, in which the innermost circle features deep patterns of cooperation enabled among like-minded societies. As tensions have intensified between Beijing and Washington over the past decade, coalitional arrangements have emerged as a key vector for parties to extend and reinforce partnerships among like-minded states, expand material and normative influence, and set multilateral agendas in line with policy preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Global cooperation is arguably most effective when pursued as a set of concentric circles, in which the innermost circle features deep patterns of cooperation enabled among like-minded societies.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UNITED STATES, ALLIES, AND PARTNERS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many plurilateral groupings pursued in the global West have begun to emphasize “like-mindedness” or ideological solidarity as an organizing principle. Deputy Prime Minister of Canada Chrystia Freeland has argued that democracies need to deepen mutual ties and drop “the pretense, or the self-delusion, that most of our relationships with authoritarian regimes can have a win-win outcome.” This idea is made explicit in the Biden administration’s U.S. National Security Strategy: while recognizing the importance of building coalitions that are “as inclusive as possible” to address global challenges, the strategy repeatedly emphasizes that “democratic nations who share our interests and values” will be “at the core of our inclusive coalition.” Such ideas are echoed in the national security strategies of key U.S. allies and partners, including Japan and Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and like-minded partners are indeed leveraging coalitions to address perceived threats from China’s more assertive international behavior. Consensus about challenges to regional stability and prosperity served to resuscitate the Quad; the group was established first in 2007 but was reestablished in 2017 and meaningfully reinvigorated during the Covid-19 pandemic, due to strategic adjustments from India arguably tied to the Ladakh border crisis with China. Shared values are a core ingredient of the Quad. As Indian foreign minister S. Jaishankar put it, “the Quad nations are all democratic polities, market economies and pluralistic societies,” a fact which generates “natural understanding” between coalition members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The revitalized Quad joins a growing set of partnerships and groupings forming what the Biden administration describes as a “latticework of strong, resilient, and mutually reinforcing relationships that prove democracies can deliver for their people and the world.” AUKUS, a trilateral partnership designed to enhance strategic coordination and technological integration between the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia, is another example. AUKUS leaders are united by a desire to “protect . . . shared values and promote security and prosperity,” including a stable, free, and open Indo-Pacific. Similarly, the U.S. and EU trade and technology consultation mechanism, launched in June 2021, aims to coordinate economic and technology policy based on shared democratic values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all U.S. coalitions are anchored around a shared set of values. Some help the United States solidify new partnerships. The I2U2 grouping established in 2021, for example, links the United States with the United Arab Emirates, Israel, and India — states of different sizes, regime types, and development levels — centered on a broad agenda spanning from infrastructure development to food security to waste treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LAYERING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that none of these approaches to multilateral cooperation need be exclusive. For example, states may simultaneously seek to create legally binding agreements between themselves (requiring both treaty commitments as well as domestic legislation for implementation), summit meetings of political leaderships, a permanent secretariat to sustain activity between summit meetings, and dedicated multiyear funding for shared projects. An example of the latter is the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), which has spent over $100 billion worldwide in the last 20 years. While such layered efforts can be made among like-minded states, one could also argue that the approach approximates many elements of U.S.-Soviet (and later, U.S.-Russian) arms control agreements. Because comprehensive agreements often require domestic support, and because legislative processes may be drawn out and have uncertain outcomes, governments may favor pursuing multiple pathways simultaneously. Doing so can both build momentum for domestic legislation and lock in agreements when the requisite domestic support is not assured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, it is important to note that congeniality and effectiveness do not always go hand in hand. As a former Asian foreign minister observed, “The inclination is to have like-minded groupings of countries that exclude [other countries] . . . but I think that type of . . . comfortable, cozy, like-minded setup, while effective in decision-making. . . doesn’t allow for difficult conversations to be had.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;non-state-actors&quot;&gt;Non-state Actors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to invigorate a world with plurilateral arrangements is to supplement them further with a broader variety of actors. More and more, global problem solving demands the participation and resources not only of governments and intergovernmental organizations but also of corporate, civic, and philanthropic actors. The Covid-19 pandemic highlighted this new dynamic: while some governments pushed politically driven narratives and restricted information flow, public health experts, universities, and foundations shared data and remedies across borders. Accordingly, growing attention is being paid to the question of how to optimize integration of intergovernmental, national, sub-national, and non-state efforts in what UN secretary-general António Guterres has called more “inclusive multilateralism.” Anne-Marie Slaughter argues, “humanity cannot afford to go back to a world in which only states matter,” and Charles Powell draws attention to three “unconventional constituencies” — cities, citizens, and corporations — whose leadership will be required to meet the climate challenge, including by encouraging and facilitating policymaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-state and sub-state actors have emerged both as problem-makers and problem-solvers in the twenty-first century. An early indication of this trend arose from the actions of al Qaeda at the turn of the century: according to Henry Kissinger, the 9/11 attacks immediately prompted questions of “how to establish international order when the principal adversaries are non-state organizations that defend no specific territory and reject established principles of legitimacy.” The leveling power of technology has increasingly enabled non-conventional actors to inflict disruption or lethal harm on states, such as through cyberterrorism and election interference. A hacker in one country can shut down a pipeline on another continent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These developments, many experts argue, challenge traditional notions of sovereignty that have historically formed the basis for order-building. As U.S. national security advisor Jake Sullivan put it in conversation with Michael Fullilove, the expanded capacity of non-state actors to inflict disruption and harm across borders has to some extent made the “Westphalian system of state-to-state diplomacy and engagement feel an increasingly distant thing.” Ian Bremmer foresees a “technopolar moment” in which big technology companies rival nation-states in their provision of national security, their delivery of digital and analog products necessary to run a modern society, and their ability to shape interactions and behaviors of citizens. As Dr. Kissinger frames it, “the very definition of state authority may turn ambiguous . . . [when] a laptop can produce global consequences.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due partially to the resource demands of addressing growing transnational challenges, multilevel and multi-stakeholder approaches to global problem solving are on the rise. The private sector brings enormous financial resources. In 2020, the combined market capitalization of just five major U.S. technology companies exceeded the GDP of every nation but the United States and China. Financial incentives for private sector actors to align themselves with global efforts, such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals, are rising as shareholders of major multinational corporations increasingly prioritize environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;As Dr. Kissinger frames it, “the very definition of state authority may turn ambiguous . . . [when] a laptop can produce global consequences.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, actors at the subnational level, such as provincial and city governments, are increasingly indispensable in addressing transnational challenges. This is particularly true for issues such as pandemics and climate change, which disproportionately affect urban environments. In many countries, local authorities were on the frontlines in Covid-19 pandemic prevention and control: distributing tests, personal protective equipment, and vaccines, as well as issuing stay-at-home orders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the climate arena, cities are now responsible for over 70 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, new arrangements have emerged to leverage these stakeholders as partners in problem solving. In 2014, for example, UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon and UN special envoy for cities and climate change Michael Bloomberg announced the “Compact of Mayors” designed to support mayors and other city officials who pledged to reduce local greenhouse gas emissions, enhance local resilience to climate change, and transparently track their progress. In 2016, the Compact for Mayors merged with an EU-focused initiative to become the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy (GCoM), a partnership between the European Union and Bloomberg Philanthropies, which has brought together over 12,500 cities and local governments across six continents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GCoM offers an example of an emerging form of multi-stakeholder internationalism that more formally incorporates philanthropies, civil society, mayors, governors, and the private sector as partners to address pressing challenges. State-based coalitions and treaty-based institutions such as the United Nations and International Monetary Fund alike are increasingly working alongside businesses, NGOs, and civic society organizations through what Slaughter and LaForge call “impact hubs.” An implicit premise of such hubs is that treaty-based institutions and states bring legitimacy and convening capacities, but non-state and local governmental actors are essential partners in financing and implementing steps to address shared challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples of this multi-stakeholder approach are proliferating across transnational issue areas such as global health, food security, and climate change. A prominent example in the realm of global health is the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI). Established in 2000, GAVI facilitates the delivery of affordable vaccines to low-income countries. GAVI was specifically designed to be a “new type of international organization, one that sought to be representative, nimble, and effective all at the same time.” While GAVI’s objectives are aligned with UN Sustainable Development Goals, and international institutions anchor the alliance, non-state actors remain central to the enterprise: the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation contributed initial seed money in 1999 and has a permanent seat on the 28-member board, alongside civil society organizations, research and technical health institutes, donor countries, and international organizations such as the WHO and the World Bank. GAVI worked alongside UNICEF and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) — another multi-stakeholder group — on the COVAX effort during the Covid-19 pandemic, which distributed nearly 2 billion vaccines to 146 countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples of this multi-stakeholder approach are found in a range of other realms. In food security, for example, the UN secretary-general recently launched the Food Systems Coordination Hub to better coordinate the work of UN bodies, international financial institutions, civil society, and private sector actors to support food systems transformations at the national level. The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), which seeks to reduce corruption and regulate information disclosure in supply chains for extractive industries (oil, gas, and mineral), is another example. Funding comes from implementing countries, international development partners, and private firms, and the board is composed of civil society organizations, firms in the industry, institutional investors, and implementing and supporting countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the energy and climate space, a prominent and recent multi-stakeholder initiative is the Global Energy Alliance for People and the Planet (GEAPP), which aims to catalyze and channel major public and private investments to improve the availability of affordable clean power. GEAPP has three types of partners: anchor partners, including foundations responsible for setting the strategic vision and providing seed capital; multilateral and regional development banks, which “amplify” philanthropic and private capital; and organizations and individuals with technical and regional expertise. Just as GAVI was established with support from the Gates Foundation, GEAPP was set up by the Rockefeller Foundation, which — with partners — invested $10 billion at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in November 2021. A multi-stakeholder approach was inherent in its design: GEAPP “recognizes that to create major change, a new approach is needed. Multiple players — governments, investors, innovators, power companies, philanthropies, and more — must come together to ensure access to electricity for all people.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As these examples suggest, broader coalitions of diverse stakeholders share many of the same advantages and disadvantages of state-based coalitions. Their flexibility encourages participation and allows for adaptation, and their modularity offers the ability to advance specific objectives. A unique advantage of bringing non-state and sub-state actors into the equation is that greater resources are brought to bear in addressing each challenge. This makes investments more sizeable, but also more stable: even as political dynamics within countries make broader cooperation difficult, non-state actors such as NGOs and corporations may still be able to work across borders and advance progress toward shared challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One implication of what Slaughter and LaForge call “opening up the order” to non-state and subnational actors involves influence over international norms and rules. Compared to the Global North, many countries in the broader Global South have relatively weak civil societies. Most sizeable philanthropies and civil society organizations, and many large corporations, are from the advanced economies of North America, Asia, and Europe. Arguably, this means that many multi-stakeholder arrangements may actually reinforce the wherewithal of developed countries in global governance, providing them with additional avenues to impose preferred norms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond this, multi-stakeholder arrangements come with their own set of risks. National governments are often suspicious of other types of actors working on issues they see as within their sovereign remit. And without coordination, having too many actors involved in solutions provision risks gridlock and redundancy: “In most areas of global problem solving,” Slaughter and LaForge argue, “the challenge is not too few actors but too many.” These considerations clarify the challenges of developing multistakeholder arrangements that not only incorporate a range of stakeholders but efficiently channel their resources, know-how, and technology into global problem solving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;looking-forward&quot;&gt;Looking Forward&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While much of the foregoing analysis describes responses to the world as it is, it does not necessarily describe the world as it will be. As the United States and its partners look toward the future, it is important to anticipate that the nature of great power conflict may change, and perhaps in large ways. In the nearer term, the termination of the Ukraine war could leave Russia isolated, poorer, and some even suspect with new leadership. Some scenarios, however, would leave Russia strengthened, and a crumbling of Western support for Ukraine could change the nature of global solidarity with the United States. Either would cast a large shadow on U.S.-Russian competition. In the longer term, however, it is hard to see how the energy transition will leave Russia stronger, and Russia’s demographic challenges pose a persistent threat to its global power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s demographic challenges are even starker. Not only has India overtaken China as the world’s most populous country, but China’s population will both age and shrink over the next half century in ways that will certainly affect its economic growth. It remains unclear if China’s current economic slowdown is a harbinger of growing structural issues or a temporary consequence of its Covid lockdown, but assuming China’s global ascent will continue uninterrupted through the twenty-first century would be a mistake. While China may indeed continue to grow in global influence, barriers to that growth are increasingly visible. Whereas it once seemed fanciful to wonder if China would grow old before it grew rich, the question is an increasingly salient one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While China may indeed continue to grow in global influence, barriers to that growth are increasingly visible.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible that a decline in the prospects of great power competitors — including the United States — could provoke governments to be less risk-averse as they seek to stave off decline. Yet, it is also possible that great power competition, which is currently at the core of U.S. global strategy, may soon be joined by the need to manage a subtler competition among rising powers for a greater share of the global pie. In this analysis, Russia’s and China’s military and intelligence capabilities mean they will remain important, but their relative importance may diminish while the growing ambitions, appetites, and independence of countries such as India, Brazil, and Saudi Arabia may grow even more salient. One former Asian national security adviser suggested, “Parts of the South now have developed capabilities they didn’t have, and hard power capabilities. If you look at it geopolitically, the contentions that matter are in the South, not in Ukraine, which is not going to change the central global balance [between China and the United States] . . . I think what we’re going to see is increasing movement by the South towards strategic autonomy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukraine war, which started in a period already marked by great power competition, has highlighted global divisions in international affairs. Great power cooperation has fallen to its lowest level since more than half a century ago, when the United States began strategically engaging China to isolate the Soviet Union. Because there is ongoing proxy warfare between the United States and Russia in Ukraine, and because Chinese and U.S. tensions over the South China Sea in general — and Taiwan in particular — are rising, efforts to put guardrails around great power conflict are fraught. Each side fears that efforts to limit escalation are merely covert efforts to convey advantage. Meanwhile, rising direct sanctions against Russia and U.S. efforts to deprive China of access to cutting-edge U.S. technology have the effect of disentangling trade and reducing incentives for cooperation. Simultaneously, even countries close to the United States have signaled a desire to distance themselves from great power competition — absent a global ideological threat, attracted by the idea of greater agency over pursuit of their individual interests, and feeling that they benefit from a diversity of relationships. Global solidarity is becoming harder to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no single reform or formula that can recover the shared sense of purpose that characterized much of the world in 1945. The world is more intimately connected than ever before, and the problems have multiplied even faster than the number of stakeholders. The appropriate response is to expand the instruments of consultation and cooperation, creating multiple forums for shared action. The foregoing essay has made clear some of the advantages of doing so, which date back to the nineteenth century’s earliest efforts at internationalism: incentivizing cooperation, coordinating the pursuit of shared interests, and enabling outcomes that individual countries’ actions are unable to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;There is no single reform or formula that can recover the shared sense of purpose that characterized much of the world in 1945.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such efforts must overcome two challenges, however. The first is that they can succumb to advancing the “least common denominator” in international forums, devoting energy to issues and partners where there is broad agreement while diverting it from important areas where there is less agreement. Such an outcome would deliver small marginal benefits, but also leave unmanaged much more important — and potentially even threatening — problems that divide important countries. A central discipline throughout this process must be to ensure that contentious issues and troubling partners continue to receive sustained attention, partly through direct engagement and partly through using broadened partnerships to help build coalitions that can push back on any single country’s excesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second challenge is that the whole process could become completely unwieldy, with so many simultaneous initiatives taking off in so many directions that they dissipate energies rather than collect them. With a limited number of senior policymakers and limited time, there must be prioritization of efforts and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s efforts to advance its agenda aggressively in every forum have not won it success but have helped stave off abject failure. The government has been able to use its position and its influence to block efforts to constrain its behavior, and it has reached a sort of understanding with China that advances common goals, or at least common defenses. China’s efforts in this space have been more successful in addressing the second set of challenges than the first. Schemes such as the Belt and Road Initiative and the Global Development Initiative have drawn wide attention and broad participation, even when their parameters are unclear — and perhaps because of it. China has done an extraordinary job framing issues, supplying vocabulary, and advancing partnerships on its own terms. On the first set of issues — a watering down of collective action — China has also been largely successful, not least because it is comfortable in a world that gives wide ambit to sovereign governments and pushes collaboration mostly into the bilateral sphere. That suits China well, since in every bilateral relationship except the one with the United States, it is the dominant partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the United States and its allies and partners approach this issue, they have several innate advantages. The first is that they have allies and partners, bound by treaty and by shared interests to pursue common goals. That is to say, they have a head start. Second, they are better positioned to make consequential and positive change: technology and know-how, combined with massive capital, makes a great deal possible. Third, they have organizational and institutional capacity, between governments and with civil society organizations. Seventy-five years of joint action have created institutional memory and institutional capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet they must develop their capacity along two lines. The first is humility. The world’s wealthiest countries have devoted hundreds of billions of dollars to efforts that they said were devoted to global prosperity. Yet, many of the targets of that aid remain poor, and some, like China, that received little aid prospered. As countries that have felt historically exploited — by colonial powers, by extractive industries, by multinational corporations, by global financial institutions, and by the dominant states that shape those institutions — gain power and agency, more powerful countries will need to weigh the wisdom and efficacy of coercive efforts against weaker ones. This is not to say that there will not be moments when pressure is essential; rather, countries will increasingly find alternatives to compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second element that must be developed is creativity. Because the United States and its allies and partners created the status quo, they have an instinct to preserve it. Yet, the very act of doing so reinforces the dissatisfaction of those who object to it. A strategy that searches creatively for common interests, builds common goals, and aligns common efforts both in rhetoric and action can break through that dissatisfaction and build durable patterns of cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this will eliminate great power competition nor resolve the growing set of issues that divide the parts of the world that are still grasping for prosperity and the parts that are trying to preserve what they have. But a robust set of institutions and initiatives that encompass a wider range of actors will help create tools to manage tensions and create opportunities for efforts that make conditions far better for all.&lt;/p&gt;

By tapping into its Cold War–era stockpiles, Russia has ramped up domestic arms production. It has also solidified ties with China, Iran, and North Korea, importing dual-use goods and weapons from these countries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine drags into its third year, Russia’s defense industry has found ways to get what it needs to ramp up arms production. The Kremlin still relies on foreign components to fuel its war effort. But it has been able to maneuver around the Western sanctions regime by turning to countries willing to supply its defense sector or by using complex cut-outs to acquire Western components indirectly. With these parts and components secured, Russia has been able to leverage its sizable weapons stockpiles built up over the Cold War period. These stockpiles of aging and often outdated equipment have enabled the Russian defense industry to overhaul and modernize older platforms quickly and at lower cost. Russia has also claimed to have increased production of some newer weapons systems entirely from scratch. In both cases, whether refurbishing older or producing brand new systems, the Kremlin has continued to rely on foreign components imported via a complicated network of intermediaries. This has proved critical to sustaining the Russian military in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report is a follow-up to the April 2023 report Out of Stock? Assessing the Impact of Sanctions on Russia’s Defense Industry. Last year’s report concluded that, during the first year of the war, sanctions created shortages of higher-end foreign components, while Moscow’s efforts at state-backed import substitution were largely limited. The sanctions affected Russia’s ability to manufacture, sustain, and deliver advanced weapons and technology to the battlefield in Ukraine. The report said the war would stress Russia’s military industrial base, already stretched thin by sanctions and high battlefield losses during the first 12 months of the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What has changed in a year? As last year’s report warned, the Kremlin still possessed a significant degree of adaptability to Western sanctions and could take advantage of its prewar stockpiles of older equipment as well as countries’ willingness to supply Moscow with restricted dual-use items and technology. That has indeed been the case. Using global supply chain data, the 2024 report analyzes the flow of restricted goods to Russia and the latter’s procurement priorities. This analysis shows that Russia remains dependent on foreign components and technology but has shifted its procurement patterns, with more military goods flowing into Russia now being sourced from civilian or dual-use suppliers. The report also demonstrates the depth and breadth of China’s support for Russia’s war effort, which, while not providing weapons directly, has enabled the ramp up of Russia’s defense industrial base to the detriment of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, two years into the war, Russia’s prospects have improved. Russia has successfully adapted its military and defense industry to minimize the impacts of the Western sanctions regime. The Kremlin has ramped up domestic production of weapons and equipment and thus has kept its army relatively well supplied. It has solidified defense ties with China and Iran and has even imported large amounts of military equipment from North Korea. Russia still relies on its older refurbished weapons stockpiles, and goods that come from its new suppliers are of lower quality than their Western alternatives, as last year’s report predicted. However, and similarly matching predictions from last year’s report, the current war of attrition in many cases does not require sophisticated high-end weapons systems and instead may be fought with large amounts of relatively cheap munitions (as demonstrated in the sections below). Therefore, Moscow’s efforts to reinvigorate its defense industry, coupled with the current pace of the war and the six-month-long Western stagnation of Ukraine aid, have ultimately translated into direct Russian battlefield successes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, Russia’s defense industry faces a number of unresolved issues, which have been exacerbated by the protracted war and sanctions and can negatively impact performance of the Russian Armed Forces in Ukraine. Among these issues are an underdeveloped military high-tech industry, corruption in the area of military procurement, an overheating economy, and labor shortages due to war-induced migration and attrition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following report details Russia’s evolving defense industrial capabilities and limitations during the second year of the war (February 2023–February 2024) and how these changes have affected and will continue to affect battlefield outcomes in Ukraine. Thematically, the report is divided into four main parts, which combined provide a holistic picture of Russia’s defense industry:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The state of Russian weapons systems in 2023:&lt;/strong&gt; The report starts with a brief overview of Russia’s domestic arms production efforts throughout 2023, followed by a detailed examination of key Russian weapons systems (such as tanks, artillery, drones, missiles, and electronic warfare systems) and their changing roles on the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russia’s evolving import diversification efforts:&lt;/strong&gt; The report then looks into the defense industrial capabilities Russia is now prioritizing to adjust to the Western sanctions regime. In doing so, CSIS tracked Russia’s general procurement dynamics and the efforts of Russian companies affiliated with the Kremlin’s war machine. This part of the report thus identifies the imported components and weapons categories that Russia’s defense industry has particularly relied on in the second year of the war and includes a case study on China to illuminate Russia’s evolving procurement patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Existing Russian military industrial limitations:&lt;/strong&gt; This part of the report dives into analysis of the Kremlin’s remaining weaknesses, which have been aggravated by a long war of attrition and which can have both short- and long-term effects on its military.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russia’s strategy in Ukraine in 2024:&lt;/strong&gt; The final part of the report assesses how Russia’s performance throughout 2023 and its evolving defense capabilities might be translated into its offensive posture in Ukraine in 2024. This part of the report is followed by recommendations to Western policymakers on how to counter the Kremlin’s war effort by capitalizing on the Russian military’s existing vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;part-i-the-state-of-russian-weapons-systems-in-2023&quot;&gt;Part I The State of Russian Weapons Systems in 2023&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russian-figures-on-increased-defense-production&quot;&gt;Russian Figures on Increased Defense Production&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, a relatively favorable economic situation enabled the Kremlin to keep boosting domestic arms production. Russia’s ability to continue shipping most of its crude oil while bypassing the G7’s oil price cap, coupled with a favorable oil price dynamic, allowed it to sustain increased defense spending, which in turn became the main driver of its economy. Additionally, technocrats steering the Russian economy have proved capable of managing the impact of sanctions, softening the war’s overall immediate and short-term effects on the majority of the population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, Russia accelerated weapons production capacity of its defense industrial sector by employing a number of state-run or affiliated military and civilian factories. However, before discussing general Russian defense production trends and numbers throughout 2023, it is worth highlighting that, due to the lack of independent open-source data, many Western observers have relied on the defense production figures reported by the Russian Ministry of Defense (MOD) and other Kremlin-linked sources. This report also cites those figures to showcase the Russian MOD’s ongoing activities and plans going forward (even if the numbers provided are likely inflated).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One important takeaway coming from Rostec, a state-owned defense conglomerate, is that the company and its subsidiaries were ordered to accelerate the pace of production for all kinds of weapons systems by multiple times ahead of the 2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive and are expected to expand even further in 2024. According to Rostec, in 2023 it increased overall production of tanks 7 times, light armored vehicles 4.5 times, and artillery and multiple launch rocket systems 2.5 times. The chief executive officer (CEO) of Rostec also said the company ramped up manufacturing of certain types of ammunition by as much as sixtyfold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to boosting arms production, Russia reportedly increased output for components — such as computers, electronics, and optical systems — that play a vital role in construction of different weapons systems from tanks to missiles. According to the Russian Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat), production of these products between January and November 2023 increased by almost 35 percent compared to the same period in 2022. Official statistics have also claimed that production of remote-control equipment, including for guiding uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), has increased around 80 percent annually. Similarly, Denis Manturov, deputy prime minister of Russia, boasted about a 58 percent growth rate in domestic production of machine tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late December 2023, the Russian MOD announced that throughout the past year the military received more than 1,500 tanks, 2,200 armored combat vehicles, 1,400 missiles and artillery weapons, and 22,000 UAVs. While impressive, the authors believe these numbers to be inflated. Additionally, it is difficult to estimate what share of these weapons was produced locally from scratch, what share was refurbished, and what share was imported from third countries willing to do business with Russia. Still, these MOD figures paint a picture of a reinvigorated domestic defense industrial sector capable of replenishing its military with new and modernized weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian government projections for 2024 include similar messaging. Russia’s national defense spending in 2024 will total 10.8 trillion rubles ($109 billion), which means that for the first time in the country’s post-Soviet history, 6 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) will be spent on the military (compared to 3.9 percent in 2023). Defense spending will exceed social spending, accounting for nearly a third of Russia’s total budget expenditures for the year. This is reflected in the Russian MOD’s ambitious claims that defense industry organizations are expected to supply Russian forces with “more than 36,000 basic types of military equipment, 16.5 million weapons, and more than one million units of portable weapons, personal armor protection, and communications equipment,” allegedly exceeding the same figures for 2022 and 2023 by several factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While, as mentioned above, the official data and statements coming from the Russian MOD are most likely exaggerated, and therefore should be taken with a grain of salt, they demonstrate the Kremlin has placed renewed emphasis on strengthening the domestic defense industrial sector. To do so, the government claims to have increased the number of defense workers, with some state-run plants and factories transitioning to a 24-hour shift schedule; simplified the procedure for concluding contracts with the Russian MOD for development and production of military products; and shortened the required timeline for selecting components and testing new weapons, among other things. The MOD also claims to have implemented a system of interdepartmental coordination to monitor and organize the work of defense industrial enterprises and respond to issues arising during production and repair of military equipment. It is likely that Russia will proceed with these efforts in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-weapons-systems-used-in-ukraine&quot;&gt;Key Weapons Systems Used in Ukraine&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years after the invasion, the overall picture for the Russian military posture has become more complex. Russia has shown resilience and adaptability to continue pressuring Ukraine on the battlefield: it has adapted to Ukrainian tactics; absorbed manpower losses while continuing to field more and more soldiers; and — as the previous section demonstrates — reinvigorated its domestic arms production, building new and refurbishing older weapons and technologies. These measures have yielded enough effect to stalemate Ukrainian efforts to advance and break through the Russian positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More precisely, this high-intensity war of attrition has prioritized certain lower-cost and lower-quality weapons like less advanced tanks, armored vehicles, artillery, small drones, and kamikaze UAVs that Russia continues to field in large numbers and that are proving effective. By contrast, more high-tech Russian weapons, such as advanced aircraft and helicopters, have proved vulnerable to Ukrainian countermeasures, leading the Russian military to withhold deploying these systems on the battlefield. Similarly, advanced Russian missiles have fallen prey to Ukrainian interceptors and are in short supply due to a high rate of usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section provides an overview of the key weapons categories used by Russian forces in Ukraine, analyzing the evolving role they have been playing on the battlefield and highlighting systems that were especially critical to Russia’s war effort throughout 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;tanks&quot;&gt;Tanks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout 2023, the Russian military continued to rely on its tank force, reportedly receiving more than 1,500 tanks (approximately 125 per month) and losing somewhere between 600 and 874 (approximately 50–73 per month), based on different estimates. While these open-source data suggest Russian tank production has increased, allowing the Russian army to maintain a large tank force despite continued losses of these vehicles, the analytical community also believes the 1,500 tanks delivered last year likely included a number of refurbished tanks from the battlefield as opposed to new-build hulls and turrets. For instance, one NATO official recently claimed that about 86 percent of the main battle tanks (MBTs) Russia produced in 2023 were refurbished. While Moscow has been estimated to maintain 5,000 tanks in storage, the official noted that “probably a large percentage of those can’t be refurbished and are only good for cannibalizing parts.” Another open-source analysis examining satellite imagery has argued that Russia has removed between 25 to 40 percent of its tank strategic reserves from open-air storage facilities since 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visual evidence coming from the battlefield confirms this reporting, showing Russia deploying its 60-year-old T-62 tanks and 70-year-old T-55 tanks against the Ukrainian forces. As the overall quantity of old Soviet tanks in Russian storage likely remains in the several thousands, the Russian MOD can field such vehicles over the course of many months in 2024, assuming they can be refurbished and are not awaiting dismantlement. Public analysis of the Ukrainian battlefield shows that some of these Russian tanks received upgrades such as new radios, modern optics, and additional layers of reactive armor, with the most common upgrade to both newer and older Russian tanks being the anti-drone metal cages and slat armor, often referred to as “cope cages.” According to CSIS’s Mick Ryan, “These cages have helped either crush the fuses of Ukrainian antitank weapons before they hit a vehicle’s main armor or forced antitank weapons to detonate before they can penetrate the vehicle.” The cages have provided an additional layer of physical protection to Russian tanks, thus giving the Russian soldiers more confidence to operate in places with a high risk of Ukrainian drone attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, visual evidence also suggests that the “cope cages” may not be universally applied. Some of the other older tanks, for instance, have no discernible upgrades and have been mainly used not for frontline combined arms mechanized assaults but as artillery and self-propelled howitzers. This shift, while already underway due to the general effectiveness of Ukrainian anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs), was accelerated by the rapid emergence of first-person view (FPV) drones in significant numbers, which have the capacity to attack any vehicle on the battlefield, and by tanks’ vulnerability to these cheap and expendable systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situation may change if Russia manages to accelerate production and deployment of more advanced tanks on the battlefield. Uralvagonzavod, Russia’s largest tank manufacturer under the umbrella of Rostec, is expected to be the main driver of this effort by ramping up production of T-90 and T-80 tanks as well as the Terminator 2 tank support combat vehicles and TOS-1/TOS-2 multiple rocket launchers. In November 2023 the CEO of Uralvagonzavod stated that the company, per the Russian military’s request, was even considering producing the T-80BVM MBTs entirely from scratch. Later reporting on this topic indicated that Russia managed to produce new variants of not only T-80BVM MBTs but also T-72B3M MBTs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, judging from the above-referenced data, Russian forces will likely continue utilizing older tanks throughout 2024, given that they are available in large numbers and thus can be relatively quickly and easily replenished. However, as these vehicles generally come with less protection and are vulnerable to drones and ATGMs, Russia will probably continue to use them mainly as mobile artillery. While the Russian MOD is trying to boost production of more advanced variants such as the T-90, T-80, and T-72 MBTs, it is not yet known if this effort will yield the intended results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;artillery-systems&quot;&gt;Artillery Systems&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian military artillery has been used to devastating effect, with Russian systems firing thousands of shells daily across the entire front. Western military analysis points to the improving situation with artillery systems production and refurbishment, as well as delivery and use at the front. In 2022, the Russian industry quadrupled 152-millimeter (mm) artillery round production, manufacturing one million rounds. This was achieved by reallocating production capacity from other shell calibers. To increase the quantity of ammunition produced, Rostec took control of 15 enterprises at the start of 2023. Today, the Russian military fields an estimated 4,700 barrel artillery systems, including the 2S19 howitzer and other systems that fire 122 mm and 152 mm rounds. The Russian military may also have as many as 1,100 multiple launch rocket systems. Rostec also indicated in December 2023 that it is testing the new Koalitsiya-SV self-propelled artillery. Its mass production has already started and there will likely be a growing number of these systems deployed in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, according to the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), Russian artillery use in Ukraine indicates that it is a capable component of the Russian military. It has a significant ability to find and strike targets over a wide area and likely retains the ability to mass fire against targets of opportunity. Russian artillery forces are continuing to build on their reconnaissance-fire contour, with aerial drones providing intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and target acquisition information to enable artillery systems to strike identified coordinates quickly and often with relative precision. At the same time, there are growing indications among Russian military commentators about the ability of Russian artillery systems to evade and escape Ukrainian counterbattery fires. In addition to self-propelled howitzers, the Russian military has close to 7,500 towed artillery pieces overall, down from approximately 12,000 stored towed pieces two years ago, indicating that Russian forces may be cannibalizing older barrels to replace those worn out by continued fighting in Ukraine. These older weapons can potentially keep the frontline batteries operating for a long time, with the Russian defense industry once again relying on its massive Cold War–era stockpiles to maintain ongoing combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;uncrewed-aerial-vehicles&quot;&gt;Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest developments in this war, especially in 2023, was the rapid emergence and scaling up of the so-called Russian loitering munitions kill chain — a compilation of UAVs with the ability to find and track targets, convey targeting data, and then assign a fire mission to the selected strike asset. To complete the kill chain, Russia has relied on short-range tactical FPV drones and commercial quadcopters, mid-range Lancet and Kub drones, long-range Geran-2 drones and their derivatives, such as the Italmas, as well as the Eleron-3, Eleron-7, Orlan-10, Orlan-30, Zala variants, and Supercam drones, to name a few. The quantity of different aerial drone types used in this war is unprecedented, especially as tens of thousands of tactical FPV-type UAVs are used every month. This scale of use, coupled with high Russian UAV losses due to Ukrainian countermeasures, therefore requires continuous drone manufacturing pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, there are indicators Russia is ramping up manufacturing for the entire drone lineup. For instance, the Kalashnikov Concern, a Rostec subsidiary manufacturing combat weapons, has converted a shopping center in the Russian city of Izhevsk into a drone manufacturing plant to make the Italmas drones. The latter are new Russian UAVs — similar to, yet cheaper than, the Iranian-made Shahed drones — which have been increasingly used in recent months in Ukraine. In May 2023, Kalashnikov’s president said the company would be able to increase the number of UAVs produced, including loitering munitions and reconnaissance drones, “by several times” in 2024. While it is difficult to confirm exact production numbers, the Russian MOD has boasted about sending 22,000 drones to the battlefield in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;One of the biggest developments in this war, especially for 2023, was the rapid emergence and scaling up of the so-called Russian loitering munitions kill chain.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iranian-made UAVs or drones modeled after them have played an important role on the battlefield. According to a senior NATO official, each month Russia is producing between 300 to 350 one-way attack drones based on a model provided by Iran. For instance, Russia has increased production of Geran-2 drones — a Russian name for the Iranian-made Shahed-136 loitering munitions that have played an important role in the war by striking Ukrainian stationary civilian and military targets such as energy infrastructure and key industrial facilities (a tactic that remains relatively unchanged since the fall of 2022, when the drones were first introduced). To increase the capacity of these UAVs, Russia has inaugurated a massive factory in Alabuga, east of Kazan, with an ambitious goal of manufacturing anywhere from 6,000 to 10,000 Geran-2 drones. By the end of 2023, Russian forces had already fired an estimated 3,700 Geran-2 drones inside Ukraine, indicating a growing reliance on this weapon as a complement and surrogate to long-range missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another Russian military go-to drone is the Lancet loitering munition lineup, with more than 1,000 recorded uses of this drone by February 2024 against Ukrainian high-value targets such as Western-provided long-range and precision artillery. However, recently, Lancet production has proved vulnerable, with Ukraine likely targeting Russian defense enterprises that manufacture components for this UAV. For instance, there was a huge explosion at the Zagorsk Optical-Mechanical Plant (ZOMZ) in August, which may have been producing components for Lancet drones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides these attack drones, the Russian military continues to rely on commercial UAVs such as the Chinese-made DJI and Autel, which are popular systems for conducting ISR and precision-drop missions. Yet the most common and increasingly valuable drone across the Russian force is an FPV-type drone assembled almost entirely from Chinese-made commercial components. Such drones typically cost less than $500 to assemble and can carry a variety of weapons and munitions at nearly 100 miles per hour to target. Since an operator can maneuver an FPV drone to strike any desired spot or location with precision, they have become increasingly dangerous to all vehicles and soldiers on the field, including even well-protected tanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike most of the military drones mentioned, practically all FPV-type drones are assembled by the country’s sprawling volunteer effort, which includes individuals, organizations, start-ups, and enterprises that fundraise for support among regular Russian citizens as well as wealthy individuals and regional governments. In 2024, FPV drones, along with ISR UAVs providing overwatch, have become so effective that they affect how both forces are fighting, requiring changes to logistics, evacuation, maneuvering, transportation, and other requirements for troops and weapons. The sheer quantity of Russian FPV drones is difficult to estimate. In late 2023, Ukrainian volunteers and military estimated that the number of Russian volunteer-built FPV drones and light quadcopters may total around 300,000 per month. While this number may seem extremely high (especially in light of official Russian MOD data stating the Russian military received roughly 22,000 drones of all types via official MOD channels in 2023), some Russian volunteers boast their specific nationwide assembly efforts can build up to 100,000 FPVs per month, or even greater numbers when other efforts are included in the total. Such numbers, even if exaggerated, imply a continuous and practically uninterrupted flow of Chinese components (discussed in detail in the following section) to numerous Russian volunteer efforts and indicate that the Russian military will come to increasingly rely on FPV drones as cheap, expendable tactical weapons well into 2024 and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, realizing the battlefield impact of both commercial and military drones, the Kremlin will likely continue deploying these cost- and time-effective weapons throughout 2024. In January 2024, the Russian MOD pledged a significant uptick in drone production for the military encompassing practically all drone types, from short-range FPV-type and ISR drones to mid- and long-range reconnaissance and combat models. It reportedly is even pushing ahead with introducing additional new drone designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;missiles&quot;&gt;Missiles&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the increasing significance of drones, the Russian military continued to rely on its tactical and long-range precision strike missiles to attack Ukrainian targets in 2023. By the end of last year, Russia had fired off an estimated 7,400 missiles into Ukraine since beginning its invasion. The pace of missile use ebbed and flowed, however, and the Russian military often fired its missiles together with Geran-2 drones to aid in penetrating Ukrainian air defense and increase their lethality. In one such attack in December 2023, Russia launched more than 100 missiles and dozens of drones against Ukrainian civilian targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Western officials, Russia limited its cruise missile strikes in the second half of 2023 in an effort to build up stockpiles for attacks in 2024. The Russian MOD’s use of Iskander-M, Kinzhal, Kh-22, Kh-47, Kh-101, and other missiles is also expected to increase in 2024 as the domestic defense industry ramps up missile production. Estimates have varied regarding the exact number of missiles Russia is capable of producing. In May 2023, for instance, Ukrainian intelligence found that Russia manufactured around sixty cruise missiles, five Iskander ballistic missiles, and two Kinzhals per month. In June 2023, the Ukrainian government noted it continued to discover Western-made microelectronic components among the wrecks of Russian missiles that were likely sourced from partners like China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assessments regarding Russia’s domestic missile production capacity started to change in September 2023, when different Russian weapons manufacturers promised to ramp up missile production efforts. For instance, the JSC Tactical Missiles Corporation — a state-run defense company specializing in missile production — said in September 2023 it had doubled production of precision weapons and, in certain cases, had increased production by as much as 3.5–5 times. In November 2023, a Ukrainian investigative team reported an expansion at the Dubna Machine-Building Plant, which is owned by JSC. At around the same time, Kalashnikov also promised to more than double production of Vikhr anti-tank missiles and Kitolov laser-guided artillery shells by opening two new facilities to speed up this effort. Due to these and other similar activities, some Western analysts have recently estimated that at the beginning of 2024 Russia may have increased its stockpile to 200 Iskander 9M723 ballistic and 9M727 cruise missiles, along with other missile variants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going forward, Russia will likely launch these missiles together with Geran-2s, using the aerial drones to identify and target Ukrainian air defenses and then flying the missiles through or even around corridors cleared of most active air defense. Such a combined salvo could be a game changer in this war given a growing stock of Geran drones relative to Russia’s overall missile force use in Ukraine. Indeed, according to Ukrainian estimates, since the beginning of 2024, the Russian Armed Forces have already used almost 1,000 missiles and about 2,800 Geran drones against targets in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;electronic-warfare-systems&quot;&gt;Electronic Warfare Systems&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electronic warfare (EW) systems remain the most active and capable countermeasures against most drones that permeate the Ukrainian battlefield. With thousands of UAVs in the air at any given time, both sides in this war have invested considerable resources into EW systems, concepts, and tactics. At this point in the war, the Russian military likely maintains an advantage over Ukraine when it comes to EW tactics, techniques, and procedures and has numerous EW systems fielded across the front, though this does not necessarily translate into more capacity to intercept Ukrainian aerial drones. In 2023 and beyond, the Russian defense industry continued to field a significant number of EW systems, ranging from large wheeled stationary complexes to portable systems transportable by light vehicles to individual soldier systems such as handheld counter unmanned aerial system (CUAS) rifles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sample Russian EW systems include the Serp stationary complex, designed to counter different UAV types, as well as Sania and ORK, specifically designed to counter the kind of FPV-type drones Ukrainians have deployed against their Russian opponents. Other commonly used systems include Lesochek, designed to counter FPV drones and light quadcopters, which can be mounted on vehicles and tanks. In 2023, there was a notable shift away from the very large systems present in 2022 — such as Krasukha — which emit a lot of electromagnetic radiation and, in turn, can be attacked by Ukrainian missiles, high-precision artillery, or even drones, toward smaller portable systems such as Antidrone and Pole-21, which can be quickly assembled and fielded close to the front lines. Russian volunteers can purchase other EW devices, such as light Chinese-made CUAS rifles, from commercial manufacturers and deliver them directly to the front. Western analysts note that Russian EW systems require high-tech components that have commercial origins, such as amplifiers, synthesizers, and software, indicating the Russian defense industry’s continued reliance on imports and international partners to acquire such technologies. Various EW systems and tactics will take center stage for the Russian military in 2024, along with the large-scale use of drones and artillery to hold off Ukrainian attempts to break out of the current stalemate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;part-ii-russias-evolving-import-diversification-efforts&quot;&gt;Part II Russia’s Evolving Import Diversification Efforts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As demonstrated in the previous section, Moscow has more actively pivoted to lower-cost weapons, such as less advanced tanks, armored vehicles, artillery, and expendable UAV types, which continue to be effective on the battlefield. By contrast, more high-tech weapons, such as advanced combat aircraft and helicopters and long-range missiles, are less frequently used during combat. Therefore, in terms of the key components and electronics the Kremlin needs for its war machine, it has moved away from tailored high-end military components toward dual-use or even purely civilian technologies. As a consequence, the composition of Russia’s suppliers has also changed as more military goods flowing into Russia are sourced from civilian or dual-use suppliers. Accordingly, in 2023, fewer Russian military companies were being sanctioned, and more companies that have a principally civilian footprint but are supplying Russia’s war effort have now found themselves on sanctions lists. These shifts in military supply chains have become a key challenge for sanctions investigators and are explored in greater detail below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[Russia] has moved away from tailored high-end military components toward dual-use or even purely civilian technologies. As a consequence, the composition of Russia’s suppliers has also changed as more military goods flowing into Russia are sourced from civilian or dual-use suppliers.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSIS experts tracked and analyzed the international procurement and distribution networks Russia has relied on to gain critical components — also referred to as key military goods for the purposes of this research — needed for its war effort. This analysis proceeded in three main steps: (1) determining the list of key military goods critical for Russia’s defense industry, (2) identifying main trends in the supply of these goods into Russia, and (3) examining individual companies and actors involved in their supply to Russian actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, the research team identified the goods most in demand within Russian military industrial production circles throughout the last year of the war. To do so, the team relied on the list of high-priority items issued jointly by the sanctions and export control enforcement authorities of the United States, United Kingdom, European Union, and Japan. This list, divided into four tiers, consists of items designated by their harmonized system (HS) codes at the six-digit level that pose a heightened risk of illegal diversion to Russia due to their criticality to its war machine. Tier 1 includes specific electronic integrated circuits, which play a key role in the production of advanced Russian precision-guided weapons systems. Russia currently lacks capacity to manufacture these items domestically, and the number of global manufacturers making these goods is also limited. Tier 2 includes certain electronic items, such as switching and routing apparatus and radio navigational aid apparatus, for which Moscow may have some domestic production capability, but it prefers to source them from Western countries, including the United States. Tiers 3 and 4 consist of items such as ball bearings and computer numerical controlled (CNC) machine tools and components that are critical to Russia’s war effort but may be acquired from a broader range of global suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This list was then supplemented with additional goods gleaned from open-source reporting on Russia’s sanctions evasion efforts. Those were identified based on their prevalence in open-source reporting channels, including Telegram and other social media channels, and then mapped to corresponding HS codes at the level of six digits. This allowed the research team to identify additional import and export patterns for key goods, such as fiberglass, brushless motors, and quadcopter blades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team then supplemented the above two goods categories with additional HS codes derived from the historical trade practices of sanctioned Russian companies. Two years into the war, international sanctions enforcement bodies have publicly designated a significant number of companies and individuals for their involvement in Russia’s military procurement efforts. CSIS, in consultation with trade and supply chain data experts, analyzed the historical procurement activities of these firms, assembling lists of key HS codes procured by these companies since the beginning of the full-scale invasion. As a result, the research team created a consistent, representative sample of key military goods necessary to the continued functioning of Russia’s military industrial complex. In total, the team identified 409 distinct HS codes at the level of six digits — all corresponding to items frequently bought or sought by Russia’s military industrial companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, the CSIS research team, following conversations with trade data analysts, identified key aggregate trends in the supply of goods from the sample into Russia as well as the Russia-led Eurasian Economic Union between January 2022 and July 2023 to capture both direct imports and shipments at risk of diversion. The research team analyzed major temporal trends as well as important shifts in the composition of the country of origin by good over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, CSIS identified individual companies and actors involved in the supply of key military goods to Russian actors. In particular, the research team focused on one China-based organization that supplies drone motors and other components to multiple Russian companies, including companies that have previously been sanctioned for military procurement. Importantly, these same companies at times also supply Ukrainian actors with critical drone parts, pointing to complicated trade-offs in sanctions policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;general-trends&quot;&gt;General Trends&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, global supply chain data analyzed by CSIS shows that Russia has been continuously adapting its purchasing patterns, which enabled it to bypass sanctions and acquire components for its defense industrial base. Since the beginning of the invasion, electrical machinery and equipment, including microelectronics, have comprised around one-third of the total imports of key military goods, reflecting the importance of electronics for Russia’s new brand of warfare (see Figure 1). The volume of key military goods imports increased sharply in the months following the declaration of partial military mobilization in September 2022, surpassing 500,000 total transactions since the beginning of 2023 (see Figure 2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/JGlSKGt.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Figure 1: Breakdown of Russian Imports of Key Military Goods by HS Chapter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/mAemsbs.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Figure 2: Volume of Russian Imports of Key Military Goods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, throughout the war, and especially in 2023, Russia has doubled down on its import diversification efforts for key military goods, further pivoting away from the West and developing both official and unofficial channels of communication with “friendly nations” across the Asia Pacific and Middle East. According to General Valery Gerasimov, the chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, “The Russian Defense Ministry continued boosting rates of interaction with foreign military agencies within military and military-technical cooperation, with more than 600 major events implemented” in 2023. The CSIS analysis (see Figure 3) also confirms a significant shift has occurred in the composition of Russia’s trading partners for key military goods, with direct prewar Western suppliers mostly being replaced by Chinese suppliers as well as shell companies located in Hong Kong, Turkey, India, and Vietnam, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/SILMjzw.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Figure 3: Russian Imports of Key Military Goods by Country of Origin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the distribution of the companies both supplying and procuring key military goods has seen a significant shift since the beginning of the war and the ongoing campaign of sanctions imposed by the West. Figure 4 shows the import trends associated with the top five suppliers of microelectronics into Russia since March 2022, irrespective of country of origin or sanctioned status. Interestingly, nearly all of the top exporters of microelectronics are based in China and Hong Kong, with one entity based in Turkey. Data obtained by CSIS further show many of the most significant importers of electronic goods have emerged since the declaration of partial military mobilization in September 2022, indicating the principal importers of important electronics into Russia are not themselves long-standing firms but likely shell companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/RUv4o8u.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Figure 4: Russia’s Top Five Microelectronic Supplier Companies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, there was significant change in the breakdown of Russian importers of electronic goods in the period studied (see Figure 5), with small procurement vehicles showing up as some of the most prominent importers of microelectronics into Russia since March 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/oGT2jQ1.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Figure 5: Top Five Russian Importers of Microelectronics into Russia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on the general trends highlighted in the trade data analysis, the research team looked deeper into the key countries that directly and indirectly supported Moscow’s war effort throughout 2023, including China, Turkey, North Korea, and Iran, among others. Taken together, these countries have shipped not only military weapons and sanctioned dual-use goods, but also civilian and commercial technologies into Russia, including construction equipment, which have helped Russia put up a resilient defense against Ukraine’s 2023 counteroffensive. Finally, in the case of China, CSIS analyzed Beijing’s trade patterns with Moscow to illuminate China’s role as the most important country enabling Russia’s war effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Many of the most significant importers of electronic goods have emerged since the declaration of partial military mobilization in September 2022, indicating the principal importers of important electronics into Russia are not themselves long-standing firms but likely shell companies.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;china&quot;&gt;China&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has been Russia’s key defense partner throughout this period, providing direct and indirect support to Moscow’s military machine. By 2023 — despite the threat of Western secondary sanctions — Chinese supplies to Russia fully replaced imports from Europe, the United States, South Korea, and Taiwan, as trade between the two countries hit a record high of $240 billion, growing 26.3 percent from 2022. Chinese shipments to Russia jumped 46.9 percent from 2022 to 2023 and 64.2 percent from 2021 to 2023. Having surpassed the European Union and become Russia’s largest trade partner, China now exports to Russia a significant share of dual-use items and technologies, from much-needed electronics to drones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More precisely, throughout the war, China has sold millions of dollars’ worth of semiconductors, chips, ball bearings, navigation equipment, parts for fighter jets, and other components to Russia. This has ultimately enabled the Kremlin to speed up its weapons production, including armor, artillery, missiles, and drones, and put up an effective defense against Ukraine’s 2023 counteroffensive. For instance, according to some estimates, Beijing’s overall share in Russian imports of machine tool parts jumped to 32 percent in 2022 and to 80–90 percent in 2023, while Chinese imports of metalworking machine tools to Russia grew to nearly 60 percent in 2022 and about 90 percent in 2023. In November 2023, Chinese year-to-date total exports of ball bearings to Russia were also up 345 percent from the same period in 2021, while exports to Kyrgyzstan, also likely subsequently routed to Russia, were up around 2,500 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An investigation by CSIS captured noteworthy shifts in Sino-Russian trade patterns surrounding a meeting between Chinese president Xi Jinping and President Putin in March 2023 (see Figure 6). For instance, narrowing in on imports of the Tier 3 high-priority items (specific electronic and mechanical components used in Russian weapons systems), as defined by multinational sanctions authorities, Beijing’s importance as a supplier of these goods comes through strongly. There was a sudden influx in shipments of high-priority items from China to Russia in March 2023, when President Xi visited Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the Tier 3 high-priority items, Russian imports of CNC machines (Tier 4) — which are used to provide precise parts for various weapons systems from ammunition to aircraft — from Chinese companies also experienced a sharp increase in the months following the Xi-Putin March 2023 meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/2yJu3LA.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Figure 6: Russian Imports of Tier 3 High-Priority Items by Sender Country of Registration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/MoBjAW9.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Figure 7: Russian Imports of CNC Machines by Sender Country of Registration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While examining these aggregate trends is useful for understanding general war-related Sino-Russian trade patterns, it is ultimately individual companies that furnish components for Russia’s war machine that are the targets of U.S. and allied sanctions efforts. CSIS has looked deeper into Russian imports of drone parts from Chinese companies due to the increasing significance of UAVs in Ukraine, as highlighted in the previous section. In April 2022, China’s biggest drone manufacturer, DJI, which has a more than 90 percent share of the global consumer drone market, announced it would discontinue its businesses in Russia and Ukraine, shutting its flagship stores and halting most direct sales to those countries. However, according to public reporting, while Ukraine faced some issues acquiring DJI-made drones due to the ongoing sales ban, these products and relevant components were imported to Russia in substantial numbers between 2022 and early 2024 through complicated networks of intermediaries. Within the first six months of 2023, Russia received at least $14.5 million in direct drone shipments from Chinese trading companies, while Ukraine received only around $200,000 worth of shipments. Even though Ukraine still managed to obtain millions of dollars’ worth of Chinese-made drones and components, most came from European intermediaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illustrating this point, the research team identified a network of foreign firms that have supplied sanctioned Russian actors, including Entep and Altrabeta (see Figure 8), with drone components throughout 2022 and 2023. Principally based in China and Hong Kong, with strong intermediary activity in Turkey, these firms have shipped goods including batteries, propellers, and motors — all explicitly designated for the production of quadcopters and multicopters — to Altrabeta and Entep in Russia as late as July 2023. Nearly identical shipments have also been made to companies in Russia that have not yet been placed on sanctions lists. In addition to direct supplies into Russia, these firms have supplied companies in intermediary jurisdictions, such as Turkey, which have then made exports of similar products into Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while these companies are likely suppliers of drone components to companies affiliated with Russia’s military industrial sector, Russian firms are not their only clients. Some of the same Chinese and Hong Kong companies that trade with Russia’s military suppliers also supply Ukrainian firms that supply the Ukrainian military. This points to a potential dilemma in the current Western sanctions strategy: while it is possible to sanction firms based on their connections to Russia’s defense industry and war effort, doing so could endanger ongoing Ukrainian procurement, perhaps in ways that are not at first obvious without full multitiered supply chain visibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/2gF3TH8.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Figure 8: Visualization of Trade Networks of Sanctioned Russia-based Firms Altrabeta and Entep&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to components and technologies with overt military applications, the Kremlin has increased imports of goods that are not usually restricted by the international sanctions regime but nonetheless play an important role in Beijing’s contribution to Moscow’s war effort. For instance, Russia has significantly increased imports of Chinese-made trucks and digging and dirt-moving equipment, helping Russian troops entrench into and transport through occupied Ukrainian territories. Chinese shipments of Aramid fiber to Russia — a class of heat-resistant synthetic fibers used in bulletproof vests — also rose more than 350 percent between 2021 and 2022, while in January and February 2023 alone, imports of this material had already reached half of 2022’s full-year total.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Some of the same Chinese and Hong Kong companies that trade with Russia’s military suppliers also supply Ukrainian firms that supply the Ukrainian military. This points to a potential dilemma in the current sanctions strategy.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, Putin has stressed that Moscow and Beijing should seek greater cooperation in the high-tech sector, from joint production of higher-end microchips in the Russian Federation to construction of high-orbit assets for space. Overall, as the Kremlin continued to pivot its defense industrial base away from the West throughout 2023, the role of China as an important defense and security partner increased dramatically. Beijing has helped ease pressure on Russia’s defense industrial sector by providing vital equipment and technologies to help Russian forces wage a long war of attrition against Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;turkey&quot;&gt;Turkey&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkey’s position on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has been equivocal. On the one hand, Ankara has provided diplomatic support to Kyiv, refusing to accept Moscow’s illegal seizure of Ukrainian territories and playing an important role in securing Ukraine’s seaborne exports, including through a grain deal brokered jointly with the United Nations in July 2022. On the other hand, Ankara has never joined the Western sanctions regime. Instead, it has become one of the top buyers of Russian crude oil and one of Russia’s key suppliers of the restricted dual-use goods required to build cruise missiles, drones, and helicopters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Financial Times, in the first nine months of 2023, Ankara reported $158 million in exports of 45 goods designated high priority by the allied sanctions enforcement agencies to Russia and five former Soviet countries — Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan. This number was three times the level recorded over the same period in 2022. Interestingly, while Turkey has officially recorded a surge in declarations of exports of high-priority items to the five ex-Soviet states, statistical agencies in these countries have not documented a matching rise in imports. Some analysts have suggested that the trade data discrepancies can indicate that those items reported by Ankara as destined for the intermediary countries were instead shipped directly to Russia. For instance, while Kazakhstan recorded $6.1 million of imports of high-priority goods from Turkey between January and September 2023, Turkey’s data showed that exports of those items to Kazakhstan reached $66 million over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, more recently, Turkish-Russian trade seems to have been affected by the executive order signed by U.S. president Joe Biden in late December 2023 threatening financial institutions doing business on behalf of those targeted by U.S. sanctions with the risk of losing access to the U.S. financial system. According to a Reuters exclusive, initial data following issuance of the order showed Turkish exports to Russia decreasing by 39 percent year on year to $631 million in January 2024 and imports from Russia declining by 20 percent to $4 billion. This has reportedly affected Ankara’s role as a supplier of dual-use goods to Moscow as “exports of machinery, in particular, stopped simply because of the similarity with military equipment,” according to a Reuters source familiar with this matter. In February 2024, the Biden administration announced new trade restrictions on 93 entities, including 16 from Turkey (the second-highest total after Russia), which may act as an additional deterrent for other Turkey-based companies helping Russia circumvent sanctions. Yet considering Russia’s adaptability to the sanctions regime, it remains to be seen if this impact will be long lasting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;north-korea&quot;&gt;North Korea&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defense cooperation between Russia and North Korea reached a new level in 2023. In September, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visited President Putin, triggering global concerns about deepening military cooperation between these two countries already in opposition to the West. During the trip, Kim and Putin visited the production sites for military aircraft at Komsomolsk-on-Amur and the Russian Pacific Fleet at Vladivostok, as well as the Vostochny Cosmodrome, a Russian spaceport. Shortly after the visit, CSIS reported increased activity at North Korea’s Tumangang rail facility bordering Russia, suggesting the dramatic increase in rail traffic could indicate North Korea was supplying Russia with arms and munitions as part of military-technical cooperation agreements the two leaders might have signed back in September.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the months that followed, different countries accused North Korea of selling weapons to Russia, including the United States and South Korea. In October, the White House announced Pyongyang had delivered more than 1,000 containers of defense equipment and munitions to Moscow to support its war effort. Shortly after, South Korea’s National Intelligence Service (NIS) claimed North Korea had sent over one million artillery shells to Russia by sea, which were then conveyed by train to Ukraine. NIS estimated those deliveries would keep Russian troops supplied for two months. In January 2024, South Korean defense experts said North Korea might have provided as many as 5,000 containers of weapons to Russia as of the end of December 2023, potentially holding around 2.3 million rounds of 152 mm shells, or around 400,000 rounds of 122 mm artillery shells. At the same time, Washington revealed new information suggesting that Russia in its recent strikes against Ukraine had used short-range ballistic missiles sourced from North Korea. U.S. national security spokesperson John Kirby called Pyongyang’s arms transfer to Moscow a “significant and concerning escalation” and said the United States would introduce additional sanctions against those involved in such arms deals. A South Korean envoy stated Ukraine has become a test site for North Korea’s nuclear-capable missiles. A recent CSIS report also found that since August 2023 there have been at least 25 different visits by vessels to North Korea’s port of Najin, to load munitions destined for Russia. Additionally, at least 19 “dark vessels” — vessels that have their automatic identification system (AIS) transmissions turned off to avoid outside detection — have visited Russia’s Vostochny Port to both unload and load containers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is believed Kim expects that, in exchange for North Korean munitions, the Russian defense ministry will provide advanced technologies and know-how to boost North Korea’s military, nuclear, and space programs. In fact, Moscow may have already helped Pyongyang successfully launch its military reconnaissance satellite in late November 2023 — two months after the Kim-Putin summit in Russia. This success followed two failed attempts in May and August of the same year. According to CSIS analysis, there is “a strong causal connection between Russian support and the pre-summit and post-summit launch results.” Putin has also suggested Russia would help North Korea develop its space satellite program, while sources close to the Russian defense ministry have said the ministry is looking for ways to deepen collaboration with Pyongyang, including organizing joint scientific conferences. Should North Korea develop fully functional military satellite capability with Russian assistance, it would be able to acquire real-time information about U.S. and South Korean military activities on the peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, 2023 saw a strengthened defense industrial partnership between Russia and North Korea, which has not only benefited the Russian military but also violated the UN Security Council’s sanctions resolutions on Pyongyang and undermined Western nonproliferation efforts. As long as the war of attrition continues, the Kremlin will likely seek to continue importing North Korean munitions, in return sharing sensitive defense technology and know-how with Kim’s regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;iran&quot;&gt;Iran&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran has been playing an important role in supplying Russia with combat drones. According to Kyiv, Moscow has launched at least 3,700 Iranian-made Shahed attack drones targeting Ukraine’s military and energy infrastructure as well as its major cities and civilian neighborhoods since September 2022. While Kyiv has been successful at shooting down up to 80 percent of those drones, such continuous mass attacks have been overwhelming Ukraine’s air defenses and have intensified in recent months, with around 10–15 Ukrainian regions engaged in shooting down Shaheds every night. While Iran has admitted selling Moscow drones before the war started, it has denied supplying Russia with military aid for the war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Existing evidence indicates the contrary. Throughout 2023, multiple reports covered Russia and Iran’s plans to construct a new factory in Russia’s Tatarstan region that could build at least 6,000 Iranian-designed Shahed drones (also known as Geran-2s in Russia) by 2025. In February 2024, evidence emerged of plans to build as many as 10,000 Shahed-type drones in Russia, indicating Moscow’s increasing demand for this UAV as one of its go-to weapons against Ukraine. Production of Shaheds in this factory would reportedly include improving Iranian fabrication processes and ultimately advancing the drone’s capabilities. Satellite imagery from November showed progress in plant construction, including new structures and security perimeters with checkpoints. Images also suggested that the buildings where the drones are being made were already operational. While the current production rate at this plant remains unknown, recent estimates have suggested that Russia produces up to 350 Shahed drones monthly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to Russo-Iranian cooperation on drones, Iran has sent Russia at least 400 short-range Fateh-110 ballistic missiles since January 2024. According to defense experts, these road-mobile missiles are accurate and reliable systems, capable of striking targets at a distance of 300–700 kilometers (186–435 miles), and Russia could successfully use them on the battlefield in Ukraine. Additional shipments from Iran might be on their way: according to 2022 U.S. Central Command estimates, Iran had over 3,000 ballistic missiles in its arsenal. Yet, based on Estonian intelligence assessments, while delivering Iranian ballistic missiles to Russia would mark an advancement in Russo-Iranian relations, it probably will not offer Russia a significant breakthrough in Ukraine, as Iran has insufficient capabilities to supply Russia with large quantities of missiles over an extended period. In return for the missiles, the Kremlin has allegedly offered unprecedented defense cooperation to Tehran, including selling attack helicopters, radar systems, and combat trainer aircraft in addition to the advanced Su-35 fighter jets Iran has publicly declared it wishes to purchase from Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s and Iran’s decisions to move away from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) payment system for cross-border transactions by the end of 2023 might further encourage arms sales between the two countries. According to the deputy head of the Central Bank of Iran, Tehran and Moscow will set up a direct interbank transfer mechanism allowing companies in both countries to trade in their respective national currencies (rials and rubles) instead of dollars or euros. A currency agreement between the two parties is expected to be signed in 2024. Should the agreement come into effect, it could ease, as well as encourage, larger-scale Russo-Iranian arms transfers, thus aiding Russia’s war in Ukraine and logistically strengthening defense-military cooperation between the two countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;other-noteworthy-actors&quot;&gt;Other Noteworthy Actors&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UNITED ARAB EMIRATES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to Turkey, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) — traditionally a Western ally but also a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries Plus (OPEC+) oil alliance, together with Russia — has refused to take sides or join the Western sanctions regime against Russia. Thanks to this approach, it has attracted Russian money and businesses fleeing increasingly hostile jurisdictions in other parts of the world. In addition to becoming a hub for the Russian business community, the UAE has seen a surge in imports of dual-use goods from Europe and the United States, many of which have found their way into Russian weapons and systems used in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November 2023, against the backdrop of multiplying Western concerns regarding the UAE’s role as a gateway for Moscow to circumvent sanctions, it agreed to restrict the re-export to Russia of sensitive goods with military applications in Ukraine. Reportedly, the UAE would expand its import and export control list by including the items designated as high priority by the allied sanctions enforcement agencies. Four companies from the UAE have also recently become subject to U.S. sanctions due to their association with Russia’s war machine. Overall, while the UAE has undoubtedly benefited from the position it has adopted vis-à-vis the Russia-Ukraine war, attracting ostracized Russian billionaires, it also values its economic and security relationship with the West and thus could become more willing to respect the Western export control measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INDIA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most notable aspect of the Russo-Indian relationship after the full-scale invasion has been New Delhi’s purchase of discounted Russian crude oil. But India has also supplied Russia with engineering items, including auto parts and electrical equipment and machinery with direct or indirect military applications. According to Reuters, India’s exports of these goods to Russia increased by 88 percent between 2022 and 2023, while for the April–December period exports increased by 130 percent, standing at $1.03 billion. Furthermore, it has also been argued that Moscow might be buying back military supplies it had previously sold to New Delhi, including parts for night vision to enhance performance of Russian missiles at night and in low light. However, given growing risks of secondary sanctions associated with the executive order signed by President Biden in late December 2023, such aspects of Russo-Indian trade might be curtailed in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KAZAKHSTAN AND UZBEKISTAN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Officially, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan remain neutral in the Russia-Ukraine war. At the same time, both countries have supported the sanctions decisions of Washington and Brussels on cooperation with Russian companies involved in the war against Ukraine. Still, according to the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan have been playing an important role in supplying Russian companies with cotton pulp, which is used in the production of gunpowder and other propellants. Within the past decade, these countries have supplied over 98 percent of Russia’s imported cotton pulp, with the trade growing since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Since May 19, 2023, the cotton pulp under HS code 470610 has been included in the U.S. export controls list, and since June 24, 2023, in the relevant EU list. In view of this, the Western sanctions authorities may tighten export and re-export controls for these types of goods. The introduction of new trade restrictions on producers of raw materials from Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan may become an additional deterrent to other companies that help Russia circumvent sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;part-iii-existing-russian-military-industrial-vulnerabilities&quot;&gt;Part III Existing Russian Military Industrial Vulnerabilities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section provides an overview of Russia’s key remaining defense industrial weaknesses and explains their potential impact on the Kremlin’s war effort going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reconstitution-rate&quot;&gt;Reconstitution Rate&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its capacity to manufacture weapons systems for an ongoing war, Russia is severely depleting its reserve stockpiles to sustain its war effort. This is especially salient when it comes to Russia’s tank force, which is increasingly fielding older models that were fully or partially modernized and upgraded, and in some cases not upgraded at all. Therefore, many predictions about Russia’s capabilities have to take into consideration the ability to rebuild its force structure in the face of continued losses at the hands of determined and experienced Ukrainian forces. It is likely that in 2024 and possibly into 2025, Russia will continue to draw on its older stocks of Soviet equipment to bolster its forces, as newer equipment will be fielded alongside more numerous systems that are many decades old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ammunition-shortages&quot;&gt;Ammunition Shortages&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Russia dominates Ukraine in terms of artillery advantage, a new RUSI report flags that Russia still faces ammunition manufacturing challenges. While Russia is firing artillery shells at a much higher rate than Ukraine, the rate is still lower than it was in 2022. It is not believed Moscow is producing enough to replenish what it is using. According to Paul Schwartz, a nonresident senior associate with CSIS,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While the ammunition production is improving, Russia is not quite there yet in terms of self-sufficiency. In other words, Russians are still using artillery at faster rates than they can replenish it, although they are closing the gap. To sustain a 10,000 shells per day (and 300,000 shells per month) rate, the Russian defense industrial base would need to produce 3.6 million shells per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond achieving self-sufficiency, Russia would require even more ammunition to attain further territorial gains in Ukraine. By the Russian MOD’s assessments, it needs to manufacture or source approximately four million 152 mm and 1.6 million 122 mm artillery shells in 2024 to achieve significant territorial breakthroughs in 2025. However, the Russian defense industry has reported it can only increase 152 mm production to 1.3 million and 122 mm production to 800,000 rounds in 2024. While Moscow increased its supplies by seeking out alternative sources of ammunition from other countries, this is not a sustainable solution. With current military industrial production at capacity, the MOD does not believe it can significantly raise production in subsequent years unless even larger investments are made in building new capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;inflationary-pressures&quot;&gt;Inflationary Pressures&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia is experiencing significant inflation. In January 2024, official annual inflation figures came in at 7.28 percent, but a survey commissioned by the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) placed inflation expectations at 12.7 percent and growing. Inflation is driven primarily by elevated government spending to procure supplies and services to support the war effort and by elevated levels of social spending to support the families and dependents of soldiers. Many previously economically depressed Russian regions have benefited from the Kremlin’s defense spending splurge, with evidence documenting rising salaries and the expansion of defense-related industries on the ground. Another widely reported area of state subsidization exists in the Russian mortgage sector, where the total value of the mortgage portfolios in Russia’s banking system hit a record year-on-year increase of 34.5 percent in 2023, exceeding the increase of 20.4 percent in 2022. An additional contributor to inflationary pressure is the weakened ruble, which in 2023 has repeatedly crossed the symbolic threshold of 100 rubles to the dollar. Due to Russia’s high dependence on imported goods, the ruble’s sluggishness creates an added expense, acting like a secondary tax on the Russian economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To combat inflation, the CBR has raised the interest rate to 16 percent, above that of the National Bank of Ukraine, while Putin issued a temporary decree in October 2023 ordering Russian exporters in major industries to convert nearly all their foreign currency earnings into rubles to boost demand for the Russian currency. Such capital control measures can help stabilize a currency, but they also risk triggering further capital outflows, devaluation, and a spike in inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the stress on Russian defense industrial enterprises is starting to become public, even as the Kremlin tries to put the most positive spin on the country’s economic performance. In a February 2024 communication intercepted by anti-Russian hackers, Dmitry Fadeev, CEO of the Murom Machine-Building Plant, complained that inflation and the shortcomings of Russia’s bureaucratic approach prevent plants that form the country’s military industrial complex from fulfilling government orders. Further, he said that plants are forced to sell their goods at prices set in 2019 but are at the same time expected to purchase inputs at market prices and in advance. He added that the money received from the government was not enough to cover the interest on the credit his firm would need to take out to pay its suppliers, and this money is tied up until the completion of the government contracts, which normally last three to five years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Overall, the stress on Russian defense industrial enterprises is starting to become public, even as the Kremlin tries to put the most positive spin on the country’s economic performance.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;labor-shortages&quot;&gt;Labor Shortages&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full-scale invasion of Ukraine reinforced the preexisting long-term demographic crisis in Russia. The total number of emigrants since 2022 is estimated at between 817,000 and 922,000 individuals, many of whom are young, well educated, and working in key industries like the information technology sector. Adding to this number are the 300,000 men who were mobilized into the armed forces, plus the 540,000 who, according to official reports, volunteered under contract in 2023. Overall, due to a combination of coronavirus-linked deaths, mobilization, and war-related casualties from 2020 to 2023, Russia’s labor pool lost about 1.9–2.8 million people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dynamic has negatively affected Russia’s dependency ratio (the ratio of pensioners to the overall population), placing further strain on the government budget. It has also contributed to an acute labor deficit. In July 2023, 42 percent of Russian industrial enterprises reported labor shortages. This issue also came up in Fadeev’s leaked interview, in which he complained of a shortage of staff at the plants due to war-related mass mobilization and a lack of accommodation in the area. Competition for labor has put upward pressure on salaries, further accelerating inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To mitigate labor shortages, the Kremlin and the Russian business community are working to bring in laborers from other countries, including North Korea, Cuba, and Kenya. Russian industries also turned to hiring teenagers and using prison labor. Despite these atypical measures, the Kremlin strikes a confident tone on questions of employment. In February 2024, President Putin bragged about the creation of over half a million new jobs in the defense sector in the last year and a half and positively remarked on the new employees’ capacity to cover multiple shifts on the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;stretched-arms-exports&quot;&gt;Stretched Arms Exports&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian arms exports industry has faced significant challenges since the early 2010s due to Western sanctions on buyers of Russian weaponry, the development of competing defense industries by large historical customers such as China and India, and a fall in orders from specific customers like the Venezuelan government, which combined put pressure on Russian weapons producers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full-scale invasion of Ukraine further exacerbated these challenges. The surplus of Russian defense products available for export abroad has been curtailed, as these materials are needed to supply Moscow’s forces. Some evidence suggests Russian arms producers are already overwhelmed by the scale of their domestic orders, thereby impeding sales abroad. Thus, in November 2023, Alexander Mikheyev, the general director of Rosoboronexport, noted that the industry’s primary responsibility is to fill orders needed by the Russian military to prosecute its war in Ukraine rather than conclude new contracts with foreign customers. In December 2023, the Russian ambassador in Yerevan reportedly admitted that Russian firms experienced difficulties in fulfilling certain orders purchased by the Armenian military. Russian state-owned media also pointed out that foreign demand for aircraft currently exceeds the production capacity of the Russian military industrial complex given the industry’s obligations to domestic clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, in December 2023, reports emerged that African buyers of Mi-17 helicopters were sending these systems for repairs in Poland, where factories in Lodz maintain capacity to provide upkeep for various Russian-produced helicopter models. Allegedly, Russian firms are currently unable to provide the repairs themselves, as their bandwidth for production is already overstretched by orders for the Russian state. If Russia cannot sufficiently expand capacity, Russian defense exporters risk losing their already vulnerable share of the international arms market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;failing-import-substitution-in-critical-areas&quot;&gt;Failing Import Substitution in Critical Areas&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has failed to achieve significant import substitution breakthroughs, particularly in high-tech fields such as mechanical and electrical engineering, robotics, infrastructure projects, biochemistry, and biopharmaceuticals. Putin has personally pointed out deficiencies in Russia’s robotics industry. In the metalworking industry, Russia imports 70–90 percent of machine tools and their components. Rostec and the Ministry of Industry and Trade have just announced a delay in the program for the supply of domestic aircraft replacing Western-made aircraft from 2024 to 2025–26. The aviation industry reportedly did not have enough time to test aircraft, and their features did not match those originally announced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This situation makes many of the Russian industries overreliant on EU and U.S. imports and therefore more vulnerable to sanctions. Specifically, EU countries have remained the main suppliers of components for industries like car construction, computer production, electronics, and optical products. U.S. supplies remain relatively high only in transport engineering due to aircraft manufacturing. According to a CBR survey in March 2023, 13 percent of surveyed companies have experienced a decline in their output due to issues with the import of investment goods. Particularly affected were the companies in the machine-building industry, which reported a 25 percent reduction in output and in wholesale trade (21 percent), construction (17 percent), manufacturing industries (15 percent), and transportation and storage (15 percent).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dependence on Western-sourced components creates bottlenecks, allowing the West to more effectively leverage the application of sanctions. While up to 40 percent of companies kept purchasing imported equipment and components through third countries, according to the CBR survey, the limited transport capacity of the Russian railways and the volume of traffic through Russia’s southern border crossings have often led to congestion issues. Further complicating the situation are the difficulties connected with making payments and sanctions enforcement by the West. Even existing sanctions have inflated the cost of components, which have risen by 30 percent for the Russian defense sector and have limited Russia’s ability to expand supplies, despite extra investment. More efficient sanctions enforcement could further disrupt supply lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overreliance-on-china&quot;&gt;Overreliance on China&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As previous sections have highlighted, Russia’s reliance on China to provide much-needed components is growing, and Chinese imports remain one of the key factors in Russia’s ability to sustain its current military status quo. Russia has been replacing many Western products with Chinese ones, from vehicles to computer chips. However, unlike Iran or North Korea, China has not sold large quantities of heavy weapons systems or shells to Russia apart from civilian equipment with dual military uses like drones and trucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s export of technological (such as microelectronic and drone) components proves critical for Russia’s manufacturing and assembly. For instance, Russia’s industrial sector has become fully dependent on China for machine tools, and components critical to arms manufacturing. By the Russian government’s own admission, the domestic drone industry is nearly 95–98 percent dependent on imported parts (especially electronics, engines, steering gears, and batteries), creating a path for potential long-term dependency on the Chinese defense industry. Russian finance minister Anton Siluanov pointed out in October 2023 that “almost all” of Russia’s civilian UAVs are being sourced from China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such overreliance makes Russia critically dependent on maintaining good relations with China. Moreover, many of the newly imported Chinese components and types of equipment are of inferior quality, being less precise and less accurate and having shorter operational lifetimes in comparison to their Western-produced analogues. The vast volumes of imports also eliminate the incentives for Russian producers to boost import diversification and import substitution. For now, the bilateral relationship between these two states appears firm enough for Moscow not to be concerned about overreliance on China and remains a key foreign policy success for the Kremlin as it competes with the United States and its allies to forge a narrative for its actions in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;corruption&quot;&gt;Corruption&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, endemic corruption has been omnipresent in the Russian military. Bribes are demanded at every level of the armed services, including leave, certification of physical training, military rank, driver’s licenses, and avoiding disciplinary action. In the post-invasion period, this expanded to include injury certificates, awards for war participation, and exemptions from being sent on a combat mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By multiple reports, at the mid level, Russian officers have exploited their positions to steal wages and fuel, manipulate budget allocations, and use conscripts for personal gain. Corruption spreading within supply chains has reduced the quality and availability of military equipment and supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the Russian military’s own assessments, one in five of Russia’s munitions stocks are unsafe due to their age and poor condition despite being routinely fired at Ukraine. Problems have been reported regarding shortages of fuel, equipping troops with non-military-grade radio systems, lack of winter clothing, and unsafe food rations. This has often forced Russian troops to switch to donations and crowdfunding to obtain basic military equipment like medical supplies and night vision goggles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corruption exists at a much larger scale at the level of military procurement, particularly in light of the many lucrative opportunities created by increased state funding, as evidenced by people continuously being sentenced for corruption-related crimes. Recent arrests have involved state corporation employees demanding bribes in exchange for funds appropriation. Corruption has systematically increased the cost of domestically procured equipment. It has also been associated with Russia’s failures to achieve its goals in import substitution areas. For example, the Russian State Armament Programme has fallen well short of its targets for navy modernization due to decades of mismanagement and corruption. Rostec was recently exposed for having attempted to pass off equipment bought on AliExpress as its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Corruption [inside Russia] has systematically increased the cost of domestically procured equipment.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corruption has contributed to the inefficiency of military planning and has undermined the discipline of the Russian army in Ukraine. This was most notable at the start of the war when Russia’s invasion plan was obstructed by fuel shortages and poor logistical support, preventing it from capturing Kyiv. While the Kremlin has learned from past mistakes, the sheer scale and pervasiveness of corruption will keep creating unexpected problems going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;part-iv-russias-strategy-in-ukraine-in-2024&quot;&gt;Part IV Russia’s Strategy in Ukraine in 2024&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2024, the Russian military will likely maintain pressure on Ukrainian forces. Russia may attempt different tactics built around certain technologies like drones in order to break through Ukrainian lines. Russia’s own rapid advances are also possible, though the Kremlin may be content with watching Ukraine expend its valuable resources, with the situation becoming more complicated for Kyiv as the United States gears up for a presidential election where foreign aid will likely remain one of the key political issues on the ballot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prevailing ability of the Russian military to take heavy losses is perhaps the biggest physical and intellectual obstacle to overcome for the Ukrainian military and its U.S. and European allies, who fight in order to avoid as many casualties as possible. The Russian military has sustained massive casualties in manpower and personnel since February 2022, with over 315,000 of Russia’s troops having been killed or injured on the battlefield (according to a U.S. intelligence estimate) without significant impact on the quality of the overall fighting force. Nonetheless, the Russian MOD continues to rely heavily on massed infantry attacks, sending large numbers of soldiers in waves against Ukrainian positions with the goal of wearing down Ukrainian defenses. Such tactics may therefore be used again in 2024, though there are indicators the Russian military is shifting toward better-organized combined arms combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite continuing high casualties, evidence on the front suggests Russia has greater capacity to mobilize. In 2023, Russia was able to sustain latent mobilization through the influx of hundreds of thousands of volunteers drawn to the war due to higher wages and better social benefits. According to the Russian leadership, about 540,000 troops entered military service under contract last year. Since the start of 2024, an additional 50,000 people have reportedly been recruited for contract service. Some observers expect this mobilization effort to further intensify in the aftermath of the March 2024 presidential election in Russia. The ability to generate additional combat power over time by recruiting contract soldiers for new formations (not just mobilizing soldiers) will give Russia additional advantages on the battlefield. Notably, the Bakhmut offensive relied on numerical superiority in conducting human wave assaults, with Moscow adopting the tactic of exhausting Ukrainian defensive positions with constant assault waves. Despite massive manpower and weapons system losses in the Avdiivka, Bakhmut, Kupyansk, and Lymansk areas, Russia is still building up its forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another advantage is Russia’s volume of ammunition. Russia currently produces more ammunition than Ukraine receives and in 2024 is set to produce 1.3 million rounds of 152 mm caliber ammunition and 800,000 rounds of 122 mm caliber ammunition. While, as the previous section on Russia’s remaining weaknesses has shown, Russia is currently unable to produce ammunition at the rate needed for self-sufficiency — and its munition imports from allies such as Iran and North Korea may prove unsustainable in the long term — it nonetheless possesses superiority over Ukraine. More precisely, Russia has dominated Ukraine with an artillery fire advantage of 5:1 for much of the battle and sometimes even 12:1. The situation is so dire that Ukraine has started using FPV drones as artillery surrogates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military observers noted that Russian successes in 2023 were also due to improved intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance operations where aerial drones play pivotal roles. Overall, the Russian military force simply has more resources at its disposal than the Ukrainian military, and it can make up for quality with sheer quantity. It has made massive artillery salvoes, has tens of thousands more drones in operation, has arrayed multiple EW systems at the front, has turned to decades-old tanks to plug gaps in the current tank and armored vehicle force, and can send thousands of troops to die. Mass-scale drone use by the Russian military is to be expected throughout 2024, with hundreds of thousands of FPV drones and thousands of commercial quadcopters and military-grade drones providing continuous battlefield observation and enabling drone strikes around the clock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, analysts admit the ongoing positional warfare will require possessing advanced technologies at scale to change the outcome. The Russian military’s resilience in the face of personnel and weapons losses may enable its forces to sustain combat in Ukraine for a number of years. This is particularly true with the absence of any significant pushback from the general population and society. In the near future, Russia will likely continue to maintain pressure on Ukraine’s civilian and military infrastructure with strikes by Geran-2 and missile systems, though the overall impact of this strategy is far from clear given that the resolve of the Ukrainian government and citizens appears unshaken in the face of such sustained strikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the Ukrainian government has asked for a number of Western weapons and systems that include artillery shells, air defense complexes, EW systems, counter-UAV technologies, and advanced aircraft as a way to hold back Russian forces. If Ukraine does not get these systems, the attritional balance could further tilt in Russia’s direction. This, in turn, could threaten Ukraine’s lengthy stand against and defiance of the Kremlin. Conversely, 2024 might also serve to demonstrate that even at the peak of its defense spending and defense industrial output, with the balance of forces in Moscow’s favor, Russia is still unable to achieve its objectives as outlined by Putin in 2022 and again in 2023. In the latter case, with mounting costs by 2025, Moscow might start facing growing uncertainty on the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Ukrainian government has asked for a number of Western weapons and systems that include artillery shells, air defense complexes, EW systems, counter-UAV technologies, and advanced aircraft as a way to hold back Russian forces. If Ukraine does not get these systems, the attritional balance could further tilt in Russia’s direction.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Conclusion and Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the onset of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia’s military industrial base has been pressured to boost its domestic production efforts against the backdrop of multiplying losses of different weapons systems and unprecedented Western sanctions and export control measures. While, in the first year of the war, Russia was largely unable to improve its domestic arms production, the analysis shows the Russian MOD was able to increase defense production multiple times over during the second year of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main developments has been the rapid emergence and massive scaling up of Russian civilian and military drones providing significant ISR and assault capabilities to the Russian armed forces, often launched with missiles for a maximum impact. While Russia has also invested in the production of modern tanks, ammunition, and EW systems, CSIS research has revealed Moscow is not self-sufficient and relies on partners such as Iran and North Korea to field enough of these weapons on the battlefield. The analysis has also shown that while Russia indeed improved its domestic arms production capacity in 2023 compared to 2022, it has nonetheless continued to tap into its Soviet-era stockpiles by, for instance, refurbishing and sending its 60- and 70-year-old tanks to Ukraine. Overall, last year saw Russia transition into a long war of attrition while increasingly shifting to low-cost and lower-quality weapons systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, in 2023 the Kremlin moved away from Western-made high-end military components toward dual-use or even purely civilian technologies to fuel its war machine. As a consequence, Russia’s international suppliers also changed as more and more military goods flowing into Russia were obtained from civilian or dual-use suppliers primarily based in China and Hong Kong, as well as in Turkey, among others. These shifts in military supply chains have also led to more Russian and foreign companies with a principally civilian footprint finding themselves on sanctions lists. Russia will likely continue following such import diversification efforts in 2024 as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The year 2024 may prove decisive for the Kremlin’s war effort. The Russian MOD, despite facing a number of weaknesses from labor shortages to entrenched corruption in the field of military procurement, will be able to sustain domestic arms production and import diversification efforts to continue its war effort. Western, and especially U.S., support of Ukraine — now expected to be resumed shortly — will be decisive in containing Russia, as well as curtailing the possibility of a direct future confrontation with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The year 2024 may prove decisive for the Kremlin’s war effort.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More precisely, Western policymakers trying to support the Ukrainian war effort should do the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continue supplying higher-end military equipment to Ukraine at a pace that exceeds Russia’s production rate.&lt;/strong&gt; This measure should be a top priority for the West, with Western countries focusing on the production of those weapons systems that are most likely to give Kyiv a strategic advantage. According to CSIS’s Mick Ryan, “Combat lessons [from Ukraine] must pass quickly from the battlefield to [Western] manufacturers, making it easier for soldiers to influence the production of equipment and munitions.” Overall, the dynamic of Russia’s war in Ukraine will determine how much of a challenge Russia represents to the West and the international liberal order going forward. The large-scale forward movement of Russian forces in Ukraine would bring the Russian threat directly to Europe’s door, making containing Russia more urgent and difficult. Sustaining and increasing military aid supplies to Ukraine, as well as overcoming partisan disagreements on this topic, should therefore remain a priority for the U.S. establishment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Target Russia’s oil revenues. Russia’s economic adjustment has become possible due to consistently high oil revenues.&lt;/strong&gt; The main way to seriously undermine Russia’s capacity to increase spending on its defense industrial sector is by targeting its oil revenues, which constitute the major income source for the government’s budget. The main economic crises the Soviet Union and Russia experienced since the 1980s were all driven by low oil prices. Western policymakers should also explore more proactive measures to push down the price of Russian oil, following in the footsteps of President Ronald Reagan’s early 1980s policy, which contributed to the economic crisis in the Soviet Union. This effort could focus on increasing oil production by countries like Saudi Arabia, decreasing purchases of Russian oil by countries like India and accelerating the clean energy transition. A recent report by the Yermak-McFaul International Working Group on Russian Sanctions outlines other measures feasible in the short term to reduce Russia’s oil revenues, including strengthening enforcement and implementing an initial downward ratchet in the price caps, as well as completing the EU embargo on Russian hydrocarbons.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Close sanctions loopholes and enforce existing export controls.&lt;/strong&gt; These measures could include introducing more serious penalties for sanctions violations, targeting third-country intermediaries, the “naming and shaming” of sanctions violators, and improving corporate responsibility for supply chain control. Recent examples show the moderate success of such measures. Since the United States started prosecuting tankers transporting Russia’s maritime oil shipments in violation of the oil price caps in October 2023, about half of the sanctioned tankers have failed to load cargoes since they were listed. More effective export controls would also necessitate reinforcing the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), using financial sanctions, and improving multilateral cooperation. Another option is to more effectively leverage U.S. financial dominance by targeting banks supporting Russia’s sanctions circumvention. Lastly, a more sensible approach to export control could prioritize selected and more easily enforceable areas, such as Western-made machine tools and components with no identifiable non-Western substitutes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaborate with the countries of the Global South.&lt;/strong&gt; The Kremlin’s ability to sustain this war is strongly conditioned by its cooperation with third countries. Cooperating with the countries of the Global South that took neutral stances on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine helped the Kremlin undermine Western attempts to isolate Russia on the international stage, reduce its military shortfalls on the battlefield, mitigate the impact of sanctions, and shape an anti-Western axis. The West should counter the Kremlin’s efforts to build these alternative alliances by employing diplomatic tools to boost negotiations with U.S. allies and partners in the Global South. To contest Russia’s leverage in the Global South, the West should prioritize investment, development, trade, and governance rather than military intervention. This effort should also focus on limiting sanctions circumvention by countries like Turkey, the UAE, and others.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Begin planning for a strengthened and empowered European defense industry.&lt;/strong&gt; Russia represents a growing challenge to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The ongoing large-scale military reforms indicate Russia may be preparing for a confrontation with NATO within the next two decades, including a large-scale conventional war. In light of these risks, Europe must urgently boost its defense production — potentially in cooperation with Ukraine. While some important adjustments are already taking place, their speed remains too slow to deter Russia from such incursions in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;陳梓華：黎智英稱外國制裁加民間力量可達至「支爆」 籲「攬炒巴」及其團隊接棒&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6XHGJmv.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（19日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第63日審訊。陳梓華繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供，他指在2020年1月連同「攬炒巴」劉祖廸，在台灣陽明山莊與黎智英會面，當時黎聲稱想培養劉做政治明星，可以資助生活費，及「畀到政治上同經濟上嘅人脈畀佢識」。惟劉未有答應。陳另引述黎說長遠而言應該爭取國際認同，由外國實施禁運和制裁來向中國和香港政府施壓，「然後我哋要團結唔同嘅板塊，再加埋民間嘅力量，先可以達到『支爆』」，屆時便是「引入美國嘅民主最好嘅時機」。陳又引述黎稱他那一代人未必可以實現到「支爆」，所以「佢希望以劉祖廸牽頭嘅攬炒團隊，同呢班年青人，可以接棒」。翌日陳與劉祖廸會見已故台灣民運人士施明德，陳引述施說：「唔好心存僥倖」，又向劉說：「如果你返香港畀人拉嘅話，其實仲好，除咗會有更多群眾嘅支持，亦都可以得到在囚抗爭者嘅支持。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已認罪的被告陳梓華第五天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。由控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行作主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱把黎智英傳送給他的文章視為一個對我嘅指導&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱把黎智英傳送給他的文章視為「一個對我嘅指導」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示黎智英與陳梓華之間的 WhatsApp 對話，在2020年1月的台北會面之前，即1月8日，黎向陳傳送一篇文章的連結，乃裴倫德（Luke de Pulford）刊登於《蘋果日報》網站的文章。陳回覆稱他看過文章，認為可以幫助到他說服那些「頑固的領袖」；黎亦指文章值得閱讀，而「攬炒巴」劉祖廸也應該看。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳解釋，他訊息提及的「頑固領袖」是指，其他在國際線上希望推廣更激進思想的人，以及勇武派。因為他在2019年11及12月與黎智英會面之後，黎希望陳能夠替他傳遞信息，包括「唔好去爭奪國際上嘅話語權，而係要大家團結一致對抗政府」。而裴倫德的文章論點，正是指「應該喺國際線上有統一的聲音」，所以陳稱將黎傳送給他的文章，「視為佢嘅一個對我嘅指導，去點說服其他人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又稱，他曾經將上述文章連結傳送給劉祖廸，但不知道對方有否閱讀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華黎智英稱想培養劉祖廸做政治明星-可資助生活費&quot;&gt;陳梓華：黎智英稱想培養劉祖廸做政治明星 可資助生活費&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳早前供稱，由於黎智英希望與「攬炒巴」劉祖廸見面交流，所以赴英國聯絡劉，並邀請劉到台灣與黎見面。陳指2020年1月11日，黎智英在台灣陽明山的別墅舉行飯局。在黎的要求下，陳、「攬炒巴」劉祖廸和林姓「女手足」提早到場，與黎智英見面及交談。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在會面中，陳簡介劉祖廸的過往工作之後，黎開始問劉，為何他的眾籌可以達到如此龐大規模。劉則分析指，因為網上有很多海外香港人及組織幫助，所以令眾籌很快增長。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，黎接著問劉在工作上是否遇到任何問題，「黎智英話想培養佢（劉）做政治明星，可以喺生活上面資助佢10千鎊」，當時黎的意思是一萬磅，但用字上是用了「10千鎊」。陳指黎亦說：「可以畀到政治上同經濟上嘅人脈畀佢識。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指劉聽了黎的說話後，並沒有立即答應，當時劉表示不想做政治明星。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華黎智英指老泛民早已與美國議員有聯繫-不應再浪費資源赴美會見&quot;&gt;陳梓華：黎智英指老泛民早已與美國議員有聯繫 不應再浪費資源赴美會見&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，就李宇軒等人赴美國會見議員，黎智英表示「唔應該係咁」，因為老泛民已經可以介紹到這些議員，「唔需要去嘥呢啲資源，重要嘅係佢哋應該識多啲枱底人，而唔係一直喺度識啲枱面人，例如 Rick Scott、Ted Cruz、Tod Young，呢啲係老泛民本身就已經有 connection。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，黎提到一些職級較低的人，可能與民運人士在彼此年輕的時候便開始認識，10年或20年之後，職級低的人可能就晉升至很高職級的官員，「咁呢啲關係就好有用喇」，可以用來做國際游說，推動反華政策。黎當時舉例指前政務司司長陳方安生和前美國眾議院議長佩洛西。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問，黎有否在會面中談論「反華政策」所指為何。陳則指後來與黎的其他對話中，黎有提及經濟封鎖、制裁，以及取消香港的特殊地位。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華黎智英指應該爭取國際認同-加上民間力從而達至支爆&quot;&gt;陳梓華：黎智英指應該爭取國際認同 加上民間力從而達至「支爆」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，「黎智英話長遠嚟講，應該爭取國際認同，然後由佢哋去做 embargo（禁運）、制裁，去向政府施壓，然後我哋要團結唔同嘅板塊，再加埋民間嘅力量，先可以達到『支爆』。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問什麼是「支爆」。陳表示：「我理解係經濟上嘅崩塌，同埋政治上政權嘅崩塌。」而「不同的板塊」是指議會、海外組織、街頭力量、國際線及商人，陳又引述黎當時稱：「其實好多商家佬都好不滿。」至於「民間力量」，陳指黎的意思是「要有民怨」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳憶述，劉祖廸聽罷黎智英的說話後，「佢（劉）表示好悲觀，佢唔相信真係會做到『支爆』」，亦不知道可以如何做到。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華引述黎當時稱好快會支爆-屆時是引入美國民主的最好時機&quot;&gt;陳梓華引述黎當時稱「好快會支爆」 屆時是引入美國民主的最好時機&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指黎當時回應：「根據歷史嘅經驗，好快會『支爆』，因為中國政府用好多嘅資源去監控人民」，但是，「就算『支爆』咗之後，中國嘅GDP都會有六成左右，而嗰陣時就係引入美國嘅民主最好嘅時機。」黎向劉說：「你更加要好好運用你嘅資源，好好利用『攬炒團隊』對你嘅支持，去推廣呢個制裁。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳引述黎接著向劉說：「國際游說唔係好似你哋咁樣做」，而是應該首先令外界知道香港發生什麼事，然後呼籲他們去譴責和關注事件，「然後就係將外國嘅枱底人，同埋政府嘅諗法帶畀香港人。」黎又指，只有將他們的想法帶入香港，「香港人先會知道，外國政府冇離棄，同埋冇忽視佢哋，同埋可以保持士氣。」此時與「枱底人」所建立的關係，「就可以影響到佢哋嘅對華政策，可以呼籲到佢哋制裁，甚至將來有可能推得翻中共。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指黎智英希望劉祖廸及攬炒團隊接棒&quot;&gt;陳梓華指黎智英希望劉祖廸及「攬炒團隊」接棒&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又引述：「黎智英話佢呢一代人未必可以實現到呢件事，佢希望以劉祖廸牽頭嘅攬炒團隊，同呢班年青人，可以接棒。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳引述劉祖廸當時回應，其個人願意合作，以及「同意呢個大方向」，但是關於「攬炒團隊」的方向，需要先跟李宇軒商討。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華黎智英當時考慮注資辦初選-稱想學習美國模式&quot;&gt;陳梓華：黎智英當時考慮注資辦初選 稱想學習美國模式&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指黎當時亦談及初選，並問劉祖廸會否嘗試參選，又表示「佢本人會幫啲政治素人，去幫佢哋做傳媒曝光，同埋經濟上支持佢哋，只要佢哋肯去參選」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/JRCb72n.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 黎智英（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此時有份審理民主派「35+」初選案的法官李運騰問，黎口中的是哪一個「初選」，當時是2020年1月，社會上有沒有任何人提出舉辦初選，或者有否相關新聞報導。陳則表示當時據他所知沒有，直至2020年2月才首次接觸或知道哪些人參與初選。李官繼而問，既然社會上未有人提出舉辦初選，在座的人是否知道黎口中的「初選」是指什麼。陳則指黎有提到「佢想學習美國嘅模式」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，黎稱他向歐洲的應用程式公司索取報價，「咁就10幾萬，唔貴。當時無講貨幣單位，但我相信係歐羅。」但是由於該應用程式只要有手提電話便可以登記投票，難以確認投票者身份，所以黎當時正在考慮中。至於舉辦初選的經費，陳指「佢（黎）話佢會經濟上支持」，又提及戴耀廷發起的「雷動計劃」，「佢有揼過錢出嚟。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華施明德稱若非黎智英介紹-不會見他及攬炒巴等人&quot;&gt;陳梓華：施明德稱若非黎智英介紹 不會見他及「攬炒巴」等人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，與黎智英見面之後翌日，在黎的安排下，陳連同「攬炒巴」劉祖廸和林姓「女手足」一同會見已故台灣民運人士施明德，當時是在施的辦公室，同場還有施的妻子。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，在會面開頭，施明德說過，如果不是黎智英介紹，「佢唔會見我哋。」施其後談論其政治生涯和政治觀點，接著問劉祖廸對香港反修例運動的看法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳引述施明德說，若果劉之後打算再做群眾運動的話，必須要考慮三點，要有認受性、統一性和一個清晰的政治訴求。施以紅衫軍及其他群眾運動作為例子，「認受性」即是要有群眾的支持、正面的媒體評價和報導，還有眾籌。「統一性」就是行動時，衣著顏色和標籤要統一。「清晰的政治訴求」以當時而言即是「五大訴求」。施亦說過：「群眾要跟隨總指揮嘅方向。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華引述施明德說唔好心存僥倖若劉祖廸回港被捕更好-因可獲得群眾支持&quot;&gt;陳梓華引述施明德說「唔好心存僥倖」、若劉祖廸回港被捕更好 因可獲得群眾支持&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，施明德其後開始談論「點樣行政治犯呢條路」、「唔好心存僥倖喇」。施向劉說：「如果你返香港畀人拉嘅話，其實仲好，除咗會有更多群眾嘅支持，亦都可以得到在囚抗爭者嘅支持。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問施口中的「心存僥倖」是什麼意思。陳指意思是「唔好以為你可以走得甩」，因為當時劉祖廸仍然想做一個匿名的抗爭者，或者海外的抗爭者，施便告訴劉：「你依家做緊嘅嘢，你一定有後果嘅，你唔好以為呢個後果係可以避開得到。」陳指劉並未有回應施這方面的說話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳表示，當時他不知道劉有否被香港政府通緝，直至後來才知道，劉在香港因為其他事情而被捕過一次，但是陳當時並不知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，施勉勵劉祖廸，「要高舉犧牲嘅精神，你唔可以自己唔犧牲，但叫其他人去做嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指線上會議跟李宇軒和攬炒巴討論國際線分工&quot;&gt;陳梓華指線上會議跟李宇軒和「攬炒巴」討論國際線分工&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳供稱，會見施明德之後當晚，他與劉祖廸跟李宇軒進行線上會議，將會見黎智英的內容告知李，而且因為李是「重光團隊」（Stand with Hong Kong，簡稱 SWHK）的領導之一，如果劉祖廸想採取黎智英建議的方向，便需要徵得李的同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，在線上會議中，大家對於團結不同板塊和國際游說去推動制裁，都表示同意，然後便討論如何分工。「尤其是『攬炒』（劉祖廸）想做到『支爆』」，劉當時考慮會否涉足議會線，但由於當時他已經是一名精神領袖，去推廣「攬炒論」和壯大 SWHK，所以大家決定由劉做國際游說，以及擴充國際上的人脈，而陳則繼續聯絡勇武派，若果再有街頭運動的話，便嘗試可否與勇武派對話，以及看看有沒有政治素人參與議會線。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於李宇軒，陳指他會負責游說外國官員或政府，去推動制裁法案或者經濟封鎖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問「攬炒論」是什麼意思。陳指是「想同個政府講，係會有代價嘅，若然你唔回應市民訴求，當時有句口號：“If you burn, you burn with us.”」，而具體上他們希望推動到制裁措施。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱將各人分工報告給黎智英-並稱會在國際線上跟隨黎的行動&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱將各人分工報告給黎智英 並稱會在國際線上跟隨黎的行動&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳供稱，在線上會議結束之後，他透過 WhatsApp Call 聯絡黎智英，陳告訴黎：「Andy（李宇軒）同劉祖廸都同意喺國際線上面跟隨你嘅行動。」當陳告訴黎，李宇軒會「打國際線」時，黎卻認為李宇軒和劉祖廸都應該要「打國際線」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至2020年1月底，陳再次聯絡黎，告知他：「『攬炒』（劉祖廸）唔想打議會線，但係喺國際線上面，就會全力開火。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳另向黎提及「當時有條日本線，就係李宇軒打嘅」，不過當中遇到問題，就是很難接觸到「枱底人」，然後黎叫陳等人聯絡其私人助手 Mark Simon，以協助美國線。陳引述黎提醒他們：「叫我哋唔好咁心急，因為係一個 long game（持久戰）。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱要求黎智英出面調停美國線爭拗-其後mark-simon擺平事件&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱要求黎智英出面調停美國線爭拗 其後Mark Simon擺平事件&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就美國線，陳指當時是由劉祖廸、李宇軒和 Shirley Ho 帶頭，但他們開始與一些當地的港人組織「有啲拗撬」，「所以我哋當時係想黎智英出面調停。」而黎則叫陳聯絡 Mark Simon。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳當時跟 Mark Simon 說，李宇軒和劉祖廸與紐約的港人組織「有啲矛盾」，所以希望 Mark 協助，「我有同佢講話，我哋想你出面調停。」陳指，雙方對於會見美國議員時應該用什麼團體名義有爭議，以及爭議誰人隨行、派誰人做代表。因為 SWHK 很多成員都是匿名行事，但是紐約的港人組織則使用真實身份，而且提交制裁名單時，究竟應使用 SWHK 還是其他團體的名義。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，Mark Simon 遂致電美國港人組織一名叫 Anna 的成員，「咁就大致解決咗個問題」，但是他們在過程中如何解決問題，陳並不知道，但是經過該次事件之後，「成條美國線就一直有同 Mark Simon 聯絡。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳早前供稱黎智英支付英國和台北之旅的費用，控方今展示陳的銀行紀錄，顯示由黎持有的力高顧問有限公司，在2020年2月底，以支票形式把約8萬元存入陳的戶口。陳指該8萬元之中有6萬元是他的開支，而餘下款項是林姓女示威者的開支。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華向黎智英傳送眾志聯盟有意參與名單-答應使他們參與初選並受約束&quot;&gt;陳梓華向黎智英傳送眾志聯盟有意參與名單 答應使他們參與初選並受約束&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年2月26日，陳梓華向黎智英傳送「眾志聯盟」的出選名單，新西派出朱凱廸、新東派出何桂藍、九東派出黃之鋒、梁凱晴做「Plan B」、九西派出張崑陽、港島派出羅冠聰、超區則派出岑敖暉。陳指，2020年2月時有風聲指會進行初選，當時有消息指上述人士有意參選立法會選舉，「佢哋當時係唔想畀初選約束」，所以他將自己所得到的資訊轉發給黎智英。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎當時回覆陳：「我們要著手處理，如果初選有認受性，他們也必須參與。且看看將來如何。（“Thanks. We’ve to work on them. But if the primary has legitimacy, they will have to join. Let’s see.”）」陳回覆：「我會盡力處理它。（“I will try my best to work on it.”）」，「至少不會讓他們拖累。（“At least not to let them ruin it.”）」陳庭上解釋，黎智英當時希望令到眾志聯盟名單上的人士參與初選，以及受到初選的約束。陳認為應該遵循他與黎早前的會面內容去做，「同埋我個人認為，我如果能夠幫到黎智英嘅話，就係貢獻緊喺反修例運動。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英轉發美國政府內部消息-沒有足夠理據實施制裁-陳梓華指劉祖廸感難過&quot;&gt;黎智英轉發美國政府內部消息 沒有足夠理據實施制裁 陳梓華指劉祖廸感難過&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年4月5日，黎智英向陳梓華轉發美國政府內部消息，並叫陳保密。陳庭上指，當時美國認為並沒有足夠理據去就香港實施制裁措施，他徵詢黎的同意後，把相關消息告知劉祖廸和李宇軒。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指二人得悉消息之後，「劉當時比較難過，但係佢當時已經打緊北歐線」，加上當時疫情關係，「都好難去做到啲咩。」陳補充，劉難過是因為「佢對美國政府有好高期望」，希望能實施制裁。至於李宇軒則「冇乜特別嘅反應」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指mark-simon認為用選票制衡政府好過暴力示威&quot;&gt;陳梓華指Mark Simon認為用選票制衡政府好過暴力示威&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，他與 Mark Simon 在大約在2020年5月再次見面，期間 Mark 指黎智英和他已經聯絡了幾間傳媒公司，會與時任「民主動力」召集人趙家賢協辦初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又指，Mark Simon 表示希望初選「會變成一個選舉嘅傳統，啫係可以制衡政府」。Mark 亦提及，「美國政府就係想見到呢啲，利用選票去制衡個政府，就會好過暴力嘅示威。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指 Mark 又稱，他會和黎智英帶陳和其他年青人出席美國聽證會，又希望陳等人不要再用眾籌款項來登報，而是應該將資源集中在國際游說。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下周二（4月23日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late March 2024, the Centre for Finance and Security (CFS) at RUSI, with the support of the Clingendael Institute, hosted a roundtable in The Hague. Held under the Chatham House Rule, the roundtable, along with a series of one-on-one meetings, discussed the state of sanctions implementation and enforcement in the Netherlands. The gatherings included representatives from national authorities with sanctions-related competences, as well as sanctions and compliance experts from financial institutions, the Dutch Banking Association and other advisers. These included, among others, the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy, Ministry of Finance, Financial Intelligence Unit–the Netherlands, the Ministry of Justice and Security, Customs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other relevant agencies. This event was part of the in-country engagements conducted by the CFS-led European Sanctions and the Illicit Finance Monitoring and Analysis Network (SIFMANet), supported by the National Endowment for Democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roundtable discussion was rooted in a consideration of the current process of modernising the current Dutch Sanctions Act (Sanctiewet 1977). Under this Act, the minister of foreign affairs is responsible for the sanctions orders that bring Dutch regulations in line with UN and EU sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the law has been amended numerous times since it was initially enacted, the scale and challenge of the sanctions imposed on Russia prompted the minister of foreign affairs to establish a temporary national coordinator for sanctions compliance and enforcement. Further, the minister of foreign affairs has launched a wider effort to modernise the Sanctions Act, collecting pre-consultation comments in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants said that, although modernisation of the Dutch Sanctions Act is a long process, the consultation around the Sanctions Act has been a useful platform to discuss wider issues with sanctions compliance in the Netherlands, to which this SIFMANet roundtable hopefully also contributed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia was a top-10 trading partner of the Netherlands before February 2022. Much of the discussion therefore focused on practical issues arising from the private and public sector challenges of enforcing sanctions while supporting the private sector in continuing to trade – this challenge featured particularly notably in the discussion. Other issues highlighted included international and local cooperation, as set out further below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;criminalising-sanctions-evasion-and-enforcement-tactics&quot;&gt;Criminalising Sanctions Evasion and Enforcement Tactics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Netherlands has been among the most active EU member states in investigating and prosecuting sanctions evasion and circumvention since 2022. For example, in October 2023, a Dutch man was fined and sentenced to 18 months in prison for exporting microchips and other dual-use electronics to Russia, in violation of EU sanctions. Other arrests have occurred, and, as of early 2024, the government confirmed 192 ongoing investigations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants said this reflected the Dutch Sanctions Act’s provision to criminalise sanctions infractions (something that is not the case in many EU member states) and allows for simple harmonisation with the upcoming EU directive’s criminalisation requirements. Dutch legislation also allows for administrative enforcement on certain sanctions breaches, but only in the financial sector. However, public bodies are considering how this can be harmonised given the perceived benefit of applying administrative penalties across industry as a way in which learning can be communicated to the private sector. No civil enforcement of material sanctions violations are known to this date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A government official said that although the Netherlands has been one of the most active EU member states in enforcing sanctions, “most cases are settlements between prosecutor and company and in most cases not published”. Participants advocated for publishing such settlements, even on an anonymised basis, to provide greater visibility on sanctions evasions methodologies and current circumvention trends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-gatekeeper-role-of-the-private-sector&quot;&gt;The Gatekeeper Role of the Private Sector&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in other countries, issues relating to ownership and control continue to plague the work of private sector actors to comply with sanctions. In the Netherlands, significant focus in 2022 fell on the yacht sector, but officials said investigating a single yacht took a significant amount of time due to complex ownership structures. The same is true for banking relationships and other private sector links with Russian-owned companies or others affected by sanctions. The Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs has responded by setting up a “collaborative platform” to study the ownership and control of companies based in the Netherlands, working alongside the Ministry of Finance, minister of foreign affairs, Customs and other government bodies. This work feeds into Dutch investment screening, but information gathered is also shared with other government bodies. If a sanctioned person was identified as an owner or controller of a company, a government representative said they would share this information with the body maintaining Dutch corporate records. However, there is no audit process identified to ensure that these designations ultimately are added to company records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the financial sector, participants believed that large Dutch and foreign-owned banks operating in the Netherlands have high compliance standards, but smaller financial institutions require greater expert support. Further, participants referred to uneven compliance by other “gatekeepers”, such as accountants, notaries and private companies. Greater collaboration between industries would be beneficial, financial industry representatives said, particularly if it could be accompanied by further support by the public sector – such as a public–private partnership format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private sector representatives believed that a number of obstacles restrict information sharing. Participants perceived strict privacy rules as restricting the amount of information sharing that would be required to tackle sanctions circumvention and evasion more robustly. For example, in line with the 2022 decision by the European Court of Justice, the full Dutch register of ultimate beneficial owners (UBO register) cannot be searched publicly, which participants said substantially restricted their ability to conduct sufficient due diligence and other compliance procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Added to this is the fact that many global companies are headquartered in the Netherlands, but the majority of their financial and trading activity occurs outside the country. Participants said both public regulators and private sector actors struggle to have sufficient visibility of the business outside the Netherlands. Informing companies headquartered in the Netherlands about their responsibilities under sanctions was also viewed as a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implementing-trade-sanctions-and-export-controls&quot;&gt;Implementing Trade Sanctions and Export Controls&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion then considered capabilities of Customs and the private sector to respond to trade sanctions, particularly in light of the December 2023 amendments to US Executive Order 14024. This Executive Order strengthened the US ability to sanction financial institutions facilitating and funding supplies to the Russian military–industrial complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants said the Netherlands’ high pre-2022 trading volume with Russia means that there is still a desire to continue to trade “legitimately” with Russia. Customs services check export declarations at the border for all exports to Russia directly, but their representative said that it is impossible to audit all exporters to see if they comply – particularly for goods declared as exports to third countries such as Kazakhstan. Further, those companies that had significant trade with Russia before 2022 had suffered commercially. In order to survive, many have explored new markets, which participants acknowledged has raised the risk that Dutch companies may be deliberately or unwittingly trading with Russia through new intermediaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A government official said they have addressed this by conducting onsite audits of companies to examine prior export records, seeking to identify potential signs of non-compliance. This is a robust measure, and the same official said they had uncovered a “spectrum” of issues, ranging from deliberate circumvention and evasion to lack of knowledge. These reviews also provide valuable insight on types of potential circumvention that cannot be detected in standard controls. One type of circumvention that can be identified in audits but not through border monitoring is brokering and strategic services supporting the movement of sanctioned goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private sector participants also noted differing risk appetites between banks and corporates. Banks, they said, have a lower risk appetite because of regulatory enforcement risk, whereas corporates are more willing to pursue trade. One government representative noted that large corporates have compliance teams, but that smaller companies are sometimes unaware of the risk of exporting dual-use goods to Central Asia: “They just see the money”. There was a perception that this is further augmented by regulators’ focus on banks, which “makes corporates feel it’s the banks’ problem and if they do something illegal, the bank will tell them”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This opens a gap, participants said, because banks lack both data and specialist export control expertise to monitor dual-use goods. Between trade finance, correspondent banking and other transactions, most banks lack sufficient information on the underlying trade. (One participant with a banking background said that banks have “only an invoice number” for many transactions.) At the same time, Dutch courts have ruled against banks when they enforce rules more strictly than legislation requires. A bank’s representative noted a case when they had exited a client due to suspicious transactions, only to be forced by a court ruling to take the client back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering banking personnel expertise, one representative from the Dutch Banking Association said that there is further work to do to support financial institutions on trade sanctions and dual-use goods. A representative from Customs said the department had met with banks to explain dual-use and export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corporates also perceived the licensing application process to be a form of administrative enforcement, insofar as licences can be (and have been) refused. But the fact that manufacturers and corporates face only potential criminal charges (not administrative) may be a potential enforcement gap: criminal prosecutions often require a level of evidence and intent that can be difficult to obtain in a sanctions circumvention matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these challenges, participants believed that the Executive Order 14024 did not have a significant impact on the industry because the compliance culture was already high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;coordination-and-measuring-impact&quot;&gt;Coordination and Measuring Impact&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roundtable’s assessment of coordination within the Netherlands was generally positive. Private sector participants did not raise concerns over a lack of coordination, despite numerous bodies involved in sanctions implementation and enforcement. Government participants acknowledged that there are many points of contact but referred to effective information sharing and relationship-building between departments. Some participants noted the need for a single point of contact, or for more centralisation. Nonetheless, several others noted that most sanctions enforcement contact is governed by industry regulators, who would continue to have oversight of other related issues. For example, a single national point of contact for sanctions would not replace financial sector regulators with overlapping requirements, including anti-money laundering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practical coordination with other member states was also seen generally positively. Law enforcement, coordination and information sharing that was carried out with other member states through existing mechanisms – such as Europol – were viewed positively. This is, however, one way in which the lack of a single point of contact could increase complication: each member state organises its sanctions mechanisms differently. Government participants said that the EU could provide more guidance and initiative, but that they have built their own networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the Dutch Banking Association said it worked well with counterparts through the European Banking Federation. Private sector participants sought more information from the government, whose powers to share information on ongoing cases are constrained by law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The differences among EU member states and lack of harmonisation frustrated participants, however. Member states interpreted the same facts differently, which caused challenges for implementation when Dutch company presence may be limited to a holding company, with assets in other EU and non-EU jurisdictions. Participants worried that different approaches to sanctions would become more of an issue with the advent of the instant credit transfer requirement within the Single Euro Payments Area, which would require financial institutions to rely on counterparties’ sanctions standards and screening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was frustration from both the public and private sector about the resources required to comply with sanctions, compared with the apparent impact. Customs authorities said they conduct risk assessments in considering which areas to prioritise when enforcing export controls. However, requests from other member states and other bodies take significant resources, even if they do not relate to high-priority goods. Some suggested impact assessments, to consider the cost of the regulation and whether it has been effective in stopping Russia’s military–industrial complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dutch authorities have clearly demonstrated commitment to the effective implementation of sanctions in the public and private sectors, and the existing sanctions legislation has allowed law enforcement to undertake robust investigation and enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was, however, some ambivalence in how to weigh sanctions against potential loss in trading and business partners. This was particularly true in the corporate sector, which is – in general – incentivised to maximise trade. Banks, then, have become the frontline in enforcing trade sanctions, but participants felt they lacked both the data and expertise to address the risk of trade sanction circumvention sufficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government has adapted with two steps to address practical issues. First, government participants highlighted that their collaboration to trace beneficial ownership for key Netherlands-registered companies is important, although private sector representatives raised concerns about how data protection restricts their ability to review ownership and control. Second, Customs described how their onsite audits of manufacturers and exporters are an important step to addressing the gaps in border detection alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was support for greater harmonisation within the Dutch government and across the EU, but also practical questions from both private and public sectors about how this could be implemented given competing legislative priorities (particularly data protection).&lt;/p&gt;

However, with Beijing showing no signs of curtailing its aggressive behaviour in the South China Sea, recent years have seen an uptick in security cooperation between Manila and Washington.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;April 2024 has thus far been marked by two major developments in the Philippines’ security relations with the US and other countries. First, the Maritime Cooperative Activity was conducted in the South China Sea (SCS) on 7 April between Australia, Japan, the Philippines and the US to promote “freedom of navigation and overflight”. Second, the first Japan–Philippines–US trilateral summit was held on 11 April to advance their shared vision of a “Free and Open Indo-Pacific”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the conduct of the annual Balikatan military exercises, this month is important for Manila and Washington because of another milestone in their alliance: the 10th anniversary of the signing of the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA). Signed on 28 April 2014 during the administration of the late Philippine President Benigno Aquino III, EDCA was designed to boost security cooperation between the two countries by providing for the increased rotational presence of US troops in “agreed locations” in the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Formal negotiations for EDCA commenced in 2013, the same year Manila filed an arbitration case against China over the SCS maritime dispute. While the Philippines won the case, security challenges in the SCS have intensified. Guided by its strategic intent to alter the balance of power in its favour, China has been much more aggressive in advancing its expansive maritime and territorial claims in the SCS. Short of an armed attack, Beijing has been relentless in harassing Philippine maritime vessels through the use of water cannons, lasers and maritime militia, among other tools. Beyond the SCS, China is likewise much more assertive in its position in its relations with Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 10 years since the agreement’s signing, EDCA has been presented with both challenges and opportunities. Indeed, just days after EDCA was signed, the agreement’s legality was challenged before the Philippines’ supreme court. Prominent Philippine legislators, including the late Miriam Defensor Santiago, then-chair of the Senate foreign relations committee, also expressed opposition to EDCA. In January 2016, after nearly two years, the supreme court ruled that EDCA was constitutional. Two months later, Manila and Washington announced the five initial “agreed locations” under EDCA: Antonio Bautista Air Base in Puerto Princesa, Palawan; Lumbia Air Base in Cagayan de Oro, Mindanao; Basa Air Base in Floridablanca, Pampanga; Fort Magsaysay in Nueva Ecija; and Mactan-Benito Ebuen Air Base in Cebu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the biggest challenge to EDCA did not come from congress or the judiciary but from the Philippine presidential palace. In June 2016, Rodrigo Duterte, a populist firebrand, succeeded Aquino. Determined to upend the country’s foreign relations, Duterte announced his intent to “separate” Manila from Washington, and declared his desire to scrap EDCA. The largest threat to EDCA’s future came in 2020 when the Duterte administration initiated the termination of the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA). Indeed, EDCA is an executive agreement designed to implement the VFA. Subsequently, the Duterte administration suspended, and later scrapped, its decision to terminate the VFA. While EDCA itself was not terminated, its implementation languished under Duterte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Beijing’s increasingly aggressive posture in advancing its claims in the South China Sea has served as a powerful impetus in revitalising the Philippines–US alliance in the past couple of years&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The election of incumbent Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr in 2022 presented an opportunity to strengthen the alliance after the uncertainty of the Duterte years. In February 2023, just months into the Marcos Jr administration, Manila and Washington announced “their plans to accelerate the full implementation” of EDCA. The allies later identified four new EDCA sites: Naval Base Camilo Osias in Santa Ana, Cagayan; Camp Melchor Dela Cruz in Gamu, Isabela; Balabac Island in Palawan; and Lal-lo Airport in Cagayan. In the same year, Washington unveiled additional funding on top of the $82 million previously announced. The allies also approved 63 additional projects to be constructed at EDCA sites, and they are eyeing more potential locations for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the visit of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Manila in March 2024, Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs Enrique Manalo described the alliance to be in “hyperdrive”. This is certainly the case in terms of security cooperation, including initiatives related to EDCA. The policy and strategy documents of both countries clearly articulate a shared concern over China’s aggressive behaviour and a desire to advance a rules-based international order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDCA’s provisions state that the deal shall have “an initial term of ten years, and thereafter, it shall continue in force automatically”. While the language of the agreement is clear that it will continue unless terminated by either party, the current developments in Philippines–US relations must not be taken to mean that it will continue on a similar trajectory in the coming years. Indeed, the past decade suggests that the future of EDCA is by no means a foregone conclusion. Three major factors could help shape the prospects of EDCA and the overall Philippines–US alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first consideration is China’s coercive behaviour in the SCS and its influence operations within the Philippines. Beijing’s increasingly aggressive posture in advancing its expansive nine-dash line claim in the SCS has served as a powerful impetus in revitalising the Philippines–US alliance in the past couple of years. Confrontations in the SCS provide opportunities for Washington to reassure Manila of its commitments under the Mutual Defense Treaty, as demonstrated in the 23 March 2024 water canon incident which led to the injury of multiple Philippine servicemembers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond maritime coercive actions, China also appears to be trying to shape Manila’s foreign relations within the Philippines through political influence operations. When it was announced that Cagayan would host an EDCA site, the province’s governor opposed the move while seeking closer ties with Beijing. It should be noted that Cagayan benefited from Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects such as the Chico River Pump Irrigation project, as well as a proposed “smart city” project on the province’s Fuga Island, which is near Taiwan. These BRI projects were initiated during the Duterte administration. There have been concerns about Chinese espionage and the military dual-use and control of critical infrastructure – similar to projects under the BRI. Moreover, it has been reported that China has been purchasing real estate in strategic areas near the SCS, such as in Zambales and Palawan. China also appears to be conducting influence operations in areas such as offshore gaming, the national power grid and telecommunications, as well as by conducting disinformation campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In recent years, public opinion polls in the Philippines have consistently indicated high levels of trust in the US&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second factor concerns domestic political developments within the Philippines and the US. The last decade has seen how domestic political transitions can swing Manila’s foreign policy pendulum. As noted earlier, the Marcos Jr administration has moved to expand EDCA, which was not fully implemented under Duterte. However, even as the Marcos Jr government forges a closer military alliance with Washington, there is significant opposition even from within the president’s coalition. Imee Marcos, the president’s sister and current chair of the Senate foreign relations committee, has been critical of EDCA’s expansion, and at one point even called for the agreement’s termination. Since leaving office, former President Duterte – who is the father of Marcos Jr’s own vice president, has also publicly criticised EDCA and the overall foreign policy of his successor. Admitting that he regularly meets with the Chinese ambassador to the Philippines, the former president also made a surprise visit to China in 2023 and met with Chinese President Xi Jinping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing, the US is about to undergo another political transition. The 2024 presidential election is poised to be an electoral rematch between US President Joe Biden and his predecessor Donald Trump. While a bipartisan consensus in favour of a stronger stance against China has been forged since the Trump administration, a degree of uncertainty over US foreign policy can be expected should Trump win another term. Indeed, a number of former key officials and moderate elements of the Republican party who served in the Trump administration have distanced themselves from the former president, and would likely not serve should he win again in November 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, there are the sentiments of the foreign and security policy community and the general public in the Philippines. Historically, there has been an anti-US element to Filipino nationalism. However, in recent years, public opinion polls in the Philippines have consistently indicated high levels of trust in the US. With its aggressive actions against the Philippine military, law enforcement personnel and civilians in the SCS, China has a low trust rating among Filipinos. Similar results were apparent in a survey conducted among members of the Philippine government and security policy community by ISEAS-Yusok Ishak Institute, a Singapore-based think tank. These sentiments were very much at play when the Philippine diplomatic and defence establishments successfully convinced then-President Duterte to suspend and later rescind his decision to abrogate the VFA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After signing EDCA on behalf of the Philippines, then-Secretary of National Defense Voltaire Gazmin said that “alliances evolve”. In the context of EDCA, the Philippines–US alliance has indeed evolved – but not in a linear way. As the past decade suggests, the future of the agreement will depend on domestic and international factors which are increasingly volatile and unpredictable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this paper is to identify requirements for the command and control (C2) of the British Army’s ground-based air defences (GBAD) within an overarching integrated air and missile defence construct. The context is that the Ministry of Defence is developing an integrated air and missile defence strategy, and the army is starting work supporting its Land GBAD programme. This paper seeks to outline the trajectory of the future air threat environment, as well as the components critical to meeting that threat, thereby deriving requirements for the C2 construct within which the UK’s GBAD will operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future threat environment is characterised by diversifying and converging threats. Historically, air threats have been optimised by their range and cost to strike targets at varying depths, and have largely fallen into two categories: systems that seek to evade defences by flying low to avoid detection; and those that fly fast at high altitude. Defensive systems had therefore been optimised to maximise their probability of successfully intercepting the specific threats aimed at the targets they were defending. Increasingly, these categories are being blurred, both in terms of the targets against which munitions are assigned, and their flight characteristics. The result is that future air defences must be designed to maximise their efficiency as a system, allocating appropriate interceptors against simultaneous, multiple threats. The sustainability of an air defence system is therefore increasingly determined by C2 efficiency. The challenge is how to establish a robust, layered air defence capability that can identify, classify and assign the most appropriate mechanism to defeating complex salvos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to track these diverse threats, the force must avoid being dependent on a small number of dedicated ground-based radars, which can be suppressed, or isolated and deceived. Instead, the air defence system must be able to fuse and integrate data tracks of varying quality and sensitivity from across the joint force’s sensors. This will include both radar on assets such as the E-7 Wedgetail and the F-35, which are optimised to track air threats, as well as sensors of opportunity normally focused on other targets. Acoustic sensors, for example, are likely to proliferate across land formations, intended to identify the source of fire. These systems are also able to provide tracks for low-flying air threats, if the data can be accessed. Accessing such data requires GBAD C2 to be bearer agnostic, and able to ingest data of varying kinds, delivered by a multitude of means. It will also be necessary for the system to be able to integrate new kinds of sensor and effector, either as new capabilities are fielded, or as novel capabilities are brought to bear in response to evolving adversary tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These characteristics are especially important because UK GBAD systems are not currently equipped to be able to defeat many kinds of air threat. UK ballistic missile defences are operated solely by the Royal Navy, for example. Wherever the UK deploys, whether alongside NATO Allies or partners further afield, it must be able to contribute to and benefit from both joint sensors and effectors, and multinational C2. The diversity of UK partners with whom the UK – as a force that is expeditionary by design – would need to integrate means that the C2 architecture must be able to publish tracks to subscribers without sharing source code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is noteworthy that the UK currently lacks GBAD C2 capacity. 7 Air Defence Group has a very small cadre of personnel who might be considered professional air defenders, since the career structure in the Royal Artillery does not keep many officers in this area for a sustained period. Interoperability, however, places a premium on experience in dealing with multiple systems, and so professionalising air defence and expanding liaison opportunities is critical. It is also important to note that the two regiments of 7 Air Defence Group are currently configured to be able to provide a C2 node at division. The UK, however, aspires to have a NATO Reserve Corps and two Divisions. It is also evident – given the lack of organic capabilities – that liaison functions across the joint force and multinational allies and partners are vital. 7 Air Defence Group currently lacks the mass to maintain this many C2 nodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further requirement is that the air defence C2 architecture be modular and mobile, without a single point of failure. This is achievable, and decision support tools mean that it is likely to become more so over time. Nevertheless, the C2 system must support air defence coordination from multiple small cells, able to be packed up and moved rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For decades, air defence has been a low priority for European NATO, which has been operating with uncontested air and fires superiority. The UK, meanwhile, despite maintaining a robust maritime air defence capability, has seen its ground-based air defence (GBAD) reduced in priority – a point best illustrated by the downgrading of the task from a brigade-level function with four regiments, to a joint headquarters commanding single-service-operated systems with two assigned regiments. Now, however, several concurrent factors have prompted a renewed focus on the importance of air defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin with, the modernisation and proliferation of highly capable Russian and Chinese air defences mean that NATO air forces must prioritise the suppression and destruction of these barriers before they can contribute directly to joint effects. This means that other elements of the force must be able to fight without air superiority – and potentially without any air cover – for limited periods. Furthermore, Iranian and Russian collaboration in developing and employing a wide range of threat systems (from low-end loitering munitions to cruise and quasi-ballistic missiles) means that air threats will remain a persistent concern, even with air superiority. A further challenge is that whereas air attack could previously be partly deterred through the psychological impact of the presence of a limited number of surface-to-air missile systems (SAMS), this cannot deter uncrewed strike systems, and consequently the credibility of a defence increasingly correlates with magazine depth and engagement efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The threat will manifest in two ways for land forces. The first is the risk of destruction at the tactical level when forces have engaged with an opponent. The second threat is that of air interdiction: the destruction of forces before they have joined the fight, or the disruption of their enabling rear area infrastructure and logistics. The risk of interdiction is one that will also be faced by other elements of the joint force, and in certain circumstances ground forces may help offset it for other force elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relationship between the terminology of air attack and land concepts is a fluid one, determined by factors such as which formations are conducting the tactical battle (which determines the depths beyond which forces might be considered to have not joined the fight). The terminology used in this paper derives from that used in the context of the doctrine of AirLand Battle, where air activity beyond corps depth was typically treated as being operational. The basis for adopting this terminology is that the European theatre within which the British Army may have to operate is characterised by distances and, increasingly, force sizes similar to those of the Cold War. It is acknowledged, however, that the definition of operational depth may differ between expeditionary contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also the question of which targets should be defined as strategic, as this term is typically reserved for the defence of either civil infrastructure or infrastructure with war-making potential (such as industry). Though the distinction is doctrinally valid, in the context of the UK, this paper presumes that the defence of both military and non-military targets in the homeland (where strategic targets reside) will be treated as part of a single zonally defined mission coordinated by HQ Air Command at High Wycombe, and thus the paper groups all defence of the homeland under the rubric of defence at strategic depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against Russia, identified as the UK’s most acute threat by the Integrated Review, British forces in the field are likely to face air threats at every stage of their deployment. Operational rear areas will be held at risk by ballistic and cruise missiles, while forces will also be threatened by UAVs, rockets and crewed aviation as they approach the forward line of own troops (FLOT). Russia will also pose a long-range strike threat to the homeland. Other putative opponents, such as Iran or its proxies, will be less likely to threaten the homeland, but will still pose a robust and layered threat to fielded forces. Against Iran, which can disseminate strike capabilities to proxies, the threat will exist in both the operate and warfight postures, as illustrated by proxy-led attacks on US forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Royal Navy (RN) and the RAF can provide defences against cruise and (some) ballistic missiles for both the homeland and fielded forces, they are also required to provide – with limited fleets – their own organic force protection. Moreover, certain types of targets, such as many UAVs, which are relevant in a land context, are not ones the RN or RAF focus on countering in planning and training. Finally, a land component, depending on how far inland it is, may not be able to draw on naval support. The British Army’s GBAD capability should, then, be able to provide a degree of organic protection for fielded forces at the divisional level (and below) against short-range tactical threats. It should also, if needed, be able to reinforce national and Alliance capacity against some operational and strategic threats. The first goal can be achieved by capabilities that the army should itself be able to field. Drawing on joint force and allied assets will reinforce the effectiveness of these capabilities, but will not determine their ability to meet missions. For the second goal, the army must be integrated by design: it must find specific roles that it can play to reinforce any integrated air and missile defence (IAMD) system of which it is a part. Adding resilience to C2 mechanisms and optimising against a subset of threat types are the areas where the army can add greatest value to partners and the joint force in the army deep (300 km) and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to this challenge, the British Army has initiated a Land GBAD programme aimed at delivering short-range air defence (SHORAD), medium-range air defence (MRAD), counter-small aerial target and counter-small uncrewed aerial system (C-UAS) capabilities to protect the UK’s deployed forces and to potentially contribute to the defence of bases in the homeland. Beyond these core platforms, however, it is notable that as threats diversify and develop, the layered defences – comprising interceptors which operate at different altitudes and ranges (and with different characteristics in terms of seekers and payloads), as well as soft kill capabilities – will also need to adapt. Furthermore, while some of these capabilities will be specialised air defence assets, the sensors and effectors for others will be distributed across units. The C2 infrastructure for such an enterprise, encompassing both the technical means for coordinating assets (control) and the organisational structures and authorities which determine their allocation against tactical tasks (command), needs to be robust, but also adaptable, such that it can integrate a wide range of sensors and effectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper outlines the diversity and trajectory of threats that the Land GBAD programme will need to manage, the sensors and effectors it will need to coordinate, and the requirements this imposes for connectivity and decision points to be enabled. The purpose of the paper is to identify requirements for a suitable C2 architecture to both support the short-term air defence capabilities to be fielded by the British military, and to coordinate a developing set of systems as novel effectors become available and greater connectivity across the force expands the range of sensors that can be leveraged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evidence base for this paper is diverse. Firstly, it relies on the technical examination of Russian and Iranian threat systems employed in the Middle East and Ukraine. This includes examination of all classes of munitions and components of key platforms, mainly recovered from the battlefield, including Kh-47M2 Kinzhal aero-ballistic and 9M723 Iskander-M quasi-ballistic missiles. It also draws on the experience of observing the evolution and coordination of the Ukrainian Air Defence Network over the course of the war, and lessons derived from the Air Defence Working Group of the Ukrainian General Staff. In addition, the paper relies on field observation of British air defence capabilities in operation, of NATO air defence C2 in operation, and of experimental capabilities for both attack and defence in the UK, the US and NATO. The research is also based on participation in live exercises in the US, where novel systems and C2 tools were tested, and on interviews with scientific technical personnel, industry and commanders of air defence units. Because of the sensitivity of much of the underlying data, the report itself outlines the concepts, rather than the technical details of the requirements, but it is informed by hard data. The paper is divided into three chapters: the first examines threats; the second analyses sensors and effectors; and the third outlines the implications for the C2 capabilities needed to stitch these sensors and effectors together as an integrated system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-charting-a-diversifying-threat-landscape&quot;&gt;I. Charting a Diversifying Threat Landscape&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make any assessment of the requirements for the C2 of the British Army’s future GBAD, it is necessary to examine the threats against which British forces must protect themselves (and others). The threat landscape may be broken into two problem sets. First, there is the requirement to protect against tactical threats targeting deployed forces. Second, there is the requirement to protect strategic and operational targets, including sea ports and air ports of embarkation and sea ports and air ports of debarkation (SPODs and APODs), bases, and headquarters from the corps level and above. There is also – per the 2023 Defence Command Paper – an imperative to protect critical national infrastructure (CNI) and centres of habitation from adversary strikes, but as regards GBAD C2, this is a similar problem set to the defence of targets in operational depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These problem sets already existed during the Cold War, but they have converged in recent years. During the Cold War, the primary conventional air threat to frontline forces was Warsaw Pact aviation, while cruise and ballistic missiles such as the OTR-23 Oka were largely prioritised for targets in operational depth, such as airbases. Missiles were useful against a narrowly defined set of static and soft targets. Improvements in the accuracy of cruise and ballistic missiles mean that they can now be used both against tactical targets and against a wider range of operational and strategic targets, allowing them to threaten several military targets, in tandem with aircraft. In effect, well-defined threat categories which could previously only be used at the tactical, operational or strategic levels have converged as a function of increasing accuracy. Meanwhile, capabilities such as loitering munitions and one-way attack UAVs have, given their low cost and different flight profiles, added another dimension to this threat landscape. Despite this, the missions of defence at each level of warfare still differ, and the UK’s GBAD programme must have a C2 architecture that controls an appropriate mix of sensors and effectors to function both across different parts of the battlespace and across the continuum from competition to conflict. This chapter will first explore the diversifying kinds of threat system, and then consider how they manifest at tactical and operational depths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;air-and-missile-threats-in-the-future-operating-environment&quot;&gt;Air and Missile Threats in the Future Operating Environment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, air threats could be divided according to two parameters: altitude and speed. Although higher-flying threats such as ballistic missiles were faster, they could be detected earlier and followed predictable parabolic trajectories, whereas more manoeuvrable threats capable of flying at lower altitudes, such as aircraft and cruise missiles, were slower but harder to detect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This binary categorisation remains valid, but is now complicated by two additional factors. The first is the emergence of weapons which straddle the categories of high speed and comparatively low trajectories, including supersonic and hypersonic cruise missiles and hypersonic glide vehicles (HGVs); quasi-ballistic and aero-ballistic threats which fly at lower altitudes than traditional ballistic missiles also fit within this category. The second factor is the emergence of especially slow and low-flying objects, such as UAVs, which fly at speeds that would normally see objects excluded from the Doppler gate of radar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This target complexity means that the attendant two-tier categorisation of sensors and effectors – with upper-tier systems interdicting fast, high-altitude targets and lower-tier systems engaging their slower counterparts – is now being challenged. A system may, for example, need to track a fast-moving target across multiple altitude brackets. This complexity of air threats is compounded by the near ubiquity of electronic warfare (EW) and decoying. In Ukraine, radar decoys have been deployed by the 3M-14 cruise missile, the 9M723 quasi-ballistic missile, and by groups of UAVs (with one UAV acting as a decoy). The detection and classification of complex targets will require the fusion of data from a broader variety of sensors to better contend with threats built to confound radar-centric defensive systems. Self-contained systems built around dedicated radar optimised against specific threats must thus be integrated both with each other and with other sensor categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second challenge to existing air and missile defence systems is the risk of suppression and destruction. While this capability was once the province of the stronger air force, conflicts such as the ongoing war in Ukraine have illustrated that a state without air superiority can still suppress an opponent’s GBAD by leveraging the growing accuracy of, among other things, surface-to-surface threats cued by UAVs. Moreover, even weaker air forces can use standoff capabilities to pose a risk from within the relative safety of their own GBAD networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third challenge is that of mass. The gulf between capabilities which can be used at scale and more bespoke precise capabilities is shrinking. Modifications to the guidance of previously “dumb” systems can increase their accuracy by an order of magnitude. In addition, capabilities such as loitering munitions can provide a cheap avenue with which to strike targets with precision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of suppression, capabilities such as Spear 3 and other precise air-launched missiles will be the most severe threat for GBAD. At present, Russia does not possess capabilities equivalent in sophistication to Spear 3, although it does use the Kh-31 in this role to some effect. In the future, Russia may obtain advanced air-launched effects from its growing collaboration with China, such that People’s Liberation Army Air Force capabilities must be a planning assumption for UK GBAD C2. The challenge posed by these capabilities is that they are specifically tailored to striking GBAD systems, are fast, manoeuvrable, can utilise an aircraft’s active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar to course correct and engage moving targets, and can therefore constrain air defence tactics. Air defences must unmask and engage other air-launched threats, but in doing so, GBAD systems risk falling victim themselves to munitions tailored for SEAD/DEAD (suppression or destruction of enemy air defences).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This threat will be compounded by the emergence, as launch platforms, of very low observable (VLO) aircraft with significantly reduced radar cross-sections. It is likely that even those states without access to high-end stealth technologies will be able to produce aircraft that can push further into defended airspace before becoming trackable. This will accelerate if there is a proliferation of uncrewed combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs), as their shapes can be far “stealthier”, owing to the lack of a crew compartment and associated life-support systems. These stealth profiles, combined with EW, make it possible for air targets to come much closer to defensive radar than is comfortable for defenders, which will be a particular challenge as the effectors carried gain range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a threat of destruction by surface-to-surface fires. Missile systems such as the Iskander and Tochka-U and multiple-launch rocket systems (MLRS) such as the GMLRS (guided multiple-launch rocket system) have demonstrated their utility in the context of DEAD missions at divisional depth (and beyond, for the Iskander). When cued in by UAVs as part of what in Russian parlance would be called a reconnaissance-fires complex (for MLRS) and a reconnaissance-strike complex (for missiles), such capabilities can strike mobile SAMS within minutes, particularly close to the FLOT, where UAV coverage is greatest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second challenge that air defenders will face is a shrinking delta between capabilities which can be used en masse and those which are more precise. Previously inaccurate threats – including air-launched glide bombs and rockets – are likely to increase in accuracy by an order of magnitude. This, in turn, will make it possible for putative opponents to achieve lethal effects with platforms which might previously have represented a marginal threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This threat will likely emanate from adversary fourth-generation fast air, with its reach extended by relatively cheap standoff weapons. Legacy air defence systems have demonstrated that they can pose sufficient threat to aircraft at medium altitude to significantly degrade the accuracy of delivered effects. Modern man-portable air defence systems (MANPADS) can, meanwhile, effectively deter penetration by fourth-generation fighters at low level, because of the unpredictability of the location of MANPADS teams. Finally, an adversary aircraft operating over the FLOT faces a considerable risk of being destroyed by defensive counter-air patrols. However, the nascent ability of fourth-generation aircraft to attack with large volumes of reasonably precise standoff munitions from within the safety of a friendly air defence network can alter this dynamic considerably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advent of guidance kits and glide kits, even at the most basic, is proving that inaccurate iron bombs can now achieve ranges of up to 70 km when lofted, and that they are likely to become highly accurate in the near future, with only limited investment. Although unsophisticated, these munitions pose a serious threat to static or point targets because they can have an explosive payload in excess of 500 kg and thus cause considerable damage; moreover, these munitions are cheap, plentiful and can be released in volume. Although they must be lofted from medium altitude (where the launch aircraft may expose itself) to achieve maximum range, the flight profile prior to loft may be lower and, if launched against targets in shallow depth, can offer a very narrow window for air defences to threaten the aircraft. Guidance kits can also be fitted to older, inaccurate surface-based systems to create a more precise capability – as Iran has done for Hezbollah’s unguided Zelzal-2 rockets, effectively transforming the 200 km-range rocket into a short-range ballistic missile (SRBM). This type of transformation could see the scale of the tactical ballistic threat increase by an order of magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attack aviation such as the Russian Ka-52 helicopter provides another launch vector for massed guided and unguided fires. Though less capable of reducing its signatures, attack aviation is likely to remain a serious threat to tactical ground formations due to the ability to hover and operate at extremely low altitude, as well as terrain mask. To retain survivability, attack aviation aims to fire munitions with ranges in excess of 10 km, taking themselves out of the MANPADS threat envelope. Efforts are also underway to field air-launched effects – essentially UAVs and other complex weapons – launched from helicopters to enable the pilots to direct complex attacks on targets. As the cost of these munitions increases and the survivability of airframes diminishes, countries may reduce the emphasis placed on attack aviation, but for now the main threat they pose is that they can carry and orchestrate a wide range of effects with very little latency between launch and strike. For a commander, attack aviation offers the flexibility of being able to manoeuvre precise firepower quickly from point to point as an anti-tank reserve. While attack aviation may primarily be a threat at the edge, it can inflict disproportionate attrition on a manoeuvre element that is not effectively protected by GBAD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third challenge for future air defenders is that of timely threat detection and classification against complex targets. This will be driven by a convergence of the systems already discussed with threats such as cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, HGVs and loitering munitions. Each threat is optimised to reduce defenders’ warning times in different ways, meaning that solutions optimised against one are likely to be inapplicable against others. In themselves, most cruise missiles are large, and are usually subsonic for most of their flight. Given that they fly low, in dense air, supersonic flight limits their range, though supersonic cruise missiles such as the P-800 Oniks can still be effective out to 400 km. Hypersonic cruise missiles, which must carry both a rocket propulsion system and a scramjet engine to achieve hypersonic flight, are likely to be even more limited in their range, compared to comparably sized missiles. Though supersonic and hypersonic cruise missiles will be restricted in terms of range, manoeuvrability, and in some cases payload, they will be difficult to intercept and will have the kinetic energy on impact to penetrate hardened targets. They will pose a challenge at tactical depth and can also pose one at operational and strategic depths if a launch platform such as a cruise missile submarine (SSGN) escapes detection. Their cost, however, limits the number of targets that justify their use. Subsonic cruise missiles are a much more common threat. These are relatively easy to intercept, but are difficult to track, because of the complexity of their flight paths and the fact that they can employ penetration aids and accelerate at key phases to complicate engagements. Given their accuracy, cruise missiles must be engaged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While most cruise missiles are difficult to find but relatively simple to intercept once tracked, ballistic missiles are easy to detect but are often difficult to intercept, due to their speed, and are likely to become more challenging targets. Short- and medium-range ballistic missiles are relatively easy to intercept at present, as illustrated by the success in testing of THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defence), as well as by Saudi Arabia’s intercept rate against Houthi SRBMs with Patriot and Ukraine’s successes with Patriot against SRBMs and air-launched ballistic missiles. Longer-range missiles are considerably faster and thus harder to engage. Moreover, even SRBMs are becoming more survivable. Like cruise missiles, they are liable to dispense penetration aids, complicating targeting, with the caveat that they move fast enough to mean that a penetration aid can only provide a short window of protection. Furthermore, more and more ballistic missiles will adopt quasi-ballistic trajectories, defying simple interception mapping – as seen with the 9M723 and the North Korean KN-24. The separation of warheads from the missile body in the terminal phase on some ballistic missiles can create a further complication, as defensive systems must distinguish between the missile body and the warhead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HGVs may be understood as combining the challenges posed by cruise and ballistic missiles. Ballistic missiles descend on their targets at hypersonic speeds, but because they fly with a high arc, they are visible to radar for much of their flight. An HGV, in contrast, may achieve a much shallower angle of attack and alter course, reducing the time available to plot its trajectory. HGVs – unlike air-launched ballistic missiles such as the Kinzhal – are unlikely to become cheap enough to be available in large numbers. This is partly because the speeds involved impose non-symmetrical friction on the missile surfaces, leading to a requirement for highly complex materials to be employed in the body of the munition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air defenders will face competing dilemmas, as they will be confronted by both missiles and loitering munitions. Loitering munitions may be understood as lower payload, simpler cruise missiles – they fly low and slow, usually carrying payloads below 40 kg (still sufficient to cause substantial damage to most tactical targets). Simple loitering munitions able to strike throughout operational depth can cost as little as $30,000. The trajectory of development for loitering munitions is likely to see several areas of growing sophistication, without significant increases in cost. First, loitering munitions are likely to attain improved hardening of their navigation systems. Second, the use of software-defined radios should enhance their ability to collaborate (there is a cost to the software development, but it does not lead to a massive increase in unit cost for hardware). It is also likely that, at a cost of around $100,000 per unit, loitering munitions can retain a command link and thereby have a full motion video guidance capability in their terminal phase, enabling strikes on mobile targets. Thirdly, the low speeds of loitering munitions and some UAVs mean that they can be sifted out by the Doppler gates of radar as clutter – as occurred with Russian Pantsir radar against Turkish TB-2 UAVs early in the conflict in Syria. Radar operating modes can be altered – Russia quickly did this in March 2022 – but this imposes cognitive load on operators (from clutter), and increases training burdens. Although loitering munitions can be brought down by crew-served weapons if shooters are properly positioned, having shooters in the right place is a significant C2 challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attack systems described above are all, in themselves, beatable. Collectively, however, they impose conflicting imperatives on a defensive architecture. For example, the task of engaging low-flying fast air requires a different set of sensors and effectors to that of intercepting VLO aircraft. Similarly, the interception of threat types that can be fielded en masse demands interceptors which can be expended at scale, while defence against cruise and ballistic missiles requires more expensive effectors with the manoeuvrability and sensor payload to engage these targets. The need to avoid suppression, particularly close to the FLOT, imposes a different dilemma. Avoiding suppression is best achieved through passive methods of detection, such as passive coherent location, as well as non-radar-based solutions. However, the delivery of track-quality data over wide areas still requires the use of active radar, at the risk of suppression or destruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;implications-for-tactical-defence&quot;&gt;Implications for Tactical Defence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, air defence in tactical depth has primarily been concerned with penetrating aviation and strike aircraft. Cruise and ballistic missiles – being expensive and consequently scarce assets – have been a concern for operational headquarters and other higher-echelon targets. Because aviation and strike aircraft were necessarily even more expensive than cruise missiles, maximising the probability of kill (Pk) by deploying highly sophisticated air defence munitions was a sensible investment. Air defence thus became a question of maximising Pk, and extending range to be able to engage strike aircraft enablers. Tactics evolved around aiming multiple missiles at a given aircraft to force the pilot into sub-optimal trade-offs against differing threats. The effect of maximising Pk is not just that it makes attempts to strike tactical targets extremely dangerous, but that this in itself deters attempts, increasing the enablement necessary to prosecute strikes with a reasonable probability of scarce aircraft surviving. This therefore limits the number of sorties that can be mounted. North Vietnamese SAMS, for example, imposed a requirement on the US Air Force to generate some 80 combat aircraft to conduct a raid on a given target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The approach of maximising the Pk of air defence systems is now being fundamentally challenged, for three reasons. Firstly, the range of threats to tactical formations is expanding to include threats which might previously only have been encountered with conventional payloads at the operational/strategic levels. Secondly, many classes of threat are drastically cheaper and thus more plentiful than legacy defensive missiles. The cost of defensive systems aimed at optimising Pk against high-end threats necessarily reduces the diversity of systems that can be afforded and deployed. For example, a hit-to-kill missile with an infrared (IR) seeker optimised for ballistic missile defence (BMD) in the upper atmosphere is not an ideal means of intercepting air-breathing and quasi-ballistic threats at altitudes where IR seekers do not work well at the high speeds achieved by BMD interceptors. Radar-equipped missiles with blast fragmentation warheads work well against air-breathing threats, but are a sub-optimal tool for BMD: each type of missile has a price in the millions of US dollars and is fired from a bespoke system. As high-end threats diversify, the characteristics of systems optimised for detecting and engaging them diverge, driving a tendency towards holding multiple missile types that are industrially expensive to develop and retain. For example, it has been estimated that a point defence of Guam with the layered defensive systems needed to counter the full spectrum of likely threats would cost $5 billion. The third challenge is that an air defence approach that prioritises the maximisation of Pk against high-end threats is more difficult to develop iteratively and quickly than the systems that are intended to spoof or otherwise degrade defensive efficiency. This means that in any conflict, the Pk of a system risks diminishing over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The measure of effectiveness at the tactical level, then, should not be the Pk of individual systems against specific threats, but rather the ability of the air and missile defence system as a whole to deliver enough protection within a given time period for specific tasks such as concentration for an attack. This is a departure from the metrics that predominated in the past, because capability is measured at the system level, not the platform level, and is bounded by time and by task. A high Pk in initial engagements is of limited value if the air defence system is exhausted through inefficient use of interceptors such that Pk subsequently collapses. To a significant degree, therefore, the effectiveness of an air defence system is increasingly determined by the capacity of the C2 system to allocate effectors against appropriate targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;threats-in-operational-and-strategic-depth&quot;&gt;Threats in Operational and Strategic Depth&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the operational and strategic levels, in a European context, the scenario used to frame the discussion is a Russian Strategic Operation for the Destruction of Critically Important Enemy Targets. This is not the only context in which the UK can expect to employ its GBAD capabilities, but it is the one most likely to involve risks to targets at both operational depth and at strategic depth within the UK. Military targets likely to be prioritised by an adversary at operational and strategic depth include SPODs and APODs and command nodes at the corps echelon and above. Assets upon which the functioning of the joint force depends, such as airbases and CAOCs (combined air operations centres), are also likely to be targeted. In addition, critical civilian infrastructure, including power generation facilities, is likely to be targeted. These targets may not all be in significant depth, but a critical mass of them are likely to be rearward of the corps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The threat environment at the operational and strategic levels is different from the tactical threat environment in several ways. On the one hand, the range needed to strike targets at depth and the payload requirements needed to inflict meaningful damage on facilities such as airbases limit the utility of many platforms which might be tactically useful. One-way attack UAVs, for example, can be useful as a terror weapon, but given their payload limitations (a Shahed-136 carries around 40 kg of explosive material), they have limited utility against critical targets that have appropriate protections, unless part of a complex strike where they are used for reconnaissance or to strike defence systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up to 500 km, the threat at the operational level will be complex, combining SRBMs, cruise missiles, attack aircraft and UAVs. In many respects, this is similar to the tactical-level threat environment: the ranges involved, as well as the presence of protected or hardened high-value targets such as command posts and ammunition storage sites, will see the number of cruise and ballistic missiles at these depths increase relative to UAVs. A greater premium is likely to be placed on large payloads and a higher probability of penetration and the presence of high-value targets at these depths justifies more expensive forms of attack – which is why, for example, Ukraine has used Storm Shadow cruise missiles against operational-level targets, to much greater effect than its salvos of UAVs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond 500 km, and particularly at strategic depth, the ballistic threat picture will be circumscribed, as the most likely adversaries do not field large numbers of intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBMs). Russia, for example, has only the Kinzhal for use at intermediate ranges, having cancelled the RS-26 Rubezh IRBM. Moreover, even states with large numbers of ballistic missiles typically use them to enable other capabilities. For example, China intends to use its ballistic missiles to trap US aircraft in their hangars by cratering runways, enabling follow-on attacks by cruise missiles. For Russia, which has fewer intermediate-range ballistic options and needs to conserve these options for sub-strategic nuclear use, the need to use capabilities such as Kinzhal and the Kh-BD judiciously will be more acute. The most likely use cases for ballistic missiles involve either enabling the effective use of cruise missiles, or strikes upon command nodes. As such, the challenge beyond 500 km is in certain ways more bounded than the tactical challenge, and will largely revolve around cruise missiles enabled by a more limited number of medium-range ballistic missiles and IRBMs, which trap their targets or eliminate defensive systems that engage cruise missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some ways, the threat at the army deep and beyond is more potent. Since many targets likely to be deemed valuable at operational and strategic depth are static, it is simpler to achieve the convergence of different capabilities moving against them at different speeds. While this level of convergence against mobile targets is discussed at a theoretical level by militaries such as China’s People’s Liberation Army, it has already been demonstrated by Russia in its attacks on Ukraine’s energy grid, which have combined UAVs, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geography and force laydowns are a consideration in any European context. Most Russian threats to the UK homeland emanating from the Western Military District would need to traverse the airspace of several NATO members, raising the probability of intercept well ahead of their reaching the UK. Moreover, on this flank, the surface vessels of the Baltic fleet which serve as launch platforms for cruise missiles such as the 3M-14 Kalibr are not survivable in a full-scale conflict involving Russia and NATO. However, this is not to say that all approaches to the UK are equally well covered, with the assets under Russia’s Northern Fleet Joint Strategic Command (OSK Sever) in particular presenting a credible threat to the homeland, as they can strike from positions relatively close to Russia’s bastions. Over time, as NATO stands up a maritime component command in a crisis, the northern flank would also become comparatively more secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, some launch platforms for Russian strike capabilities are more survivable, and could theoretically conduct strikes against the UK, giving defenders very limited warning – for example, the Yasen-class SSGN, which is equipped with 40 vertical launching system (VLS) cells and which can launch a variety of cruise missiles, including the 3M-14 Kalibr and the hypersonic Zircon. Platforms such as the Yasen or the older but still quiet Akula class can, if they escape into the Atlantic, launch strikes against targets such as airbases at ranges that would leave little room for aircraft hosted there to scramble. This would create a “flaming datum” – a last known location of the submarine, which would increase the risk of destruction; consequently the range of targets that might justify risking the use of a high-value asset in this way is limited, with the most likely candidates being fifth-generation aircraft, maritime patrol aircraft bases and critical C2 nodes, the RN base at Faslane, and CNI. As a conflict progressed, aircraft might well be dispersed, making suppression more difficult, and as such the threat would be most acute in the early stages of a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to high-value capabilities, Russia has developed containerised versions of missiles such as the Klub-K, which can be fired from the decks of cargo vessels, a mode of operation that could allow it to strike targets inside the UK with limited warning. Russian-flagged vessels and those that have left Russian ports are likely to be closely watched in a conflict, meaning that this kind of attack could only be attempted once (or at the commencement of fighting), but should even a fraction of vessels armed in this way strike militarily significant targets before being interdicted, this would represent a militarily useful effect for the loss of disposable assets. Finally, there is the threat from Russia’s long-range bombers, which can launch salvos of cruise missiles. Given NATO’s relative superiority in the air, such strikes would be unlikely to be repeatable, but early in a conflict would pose a risk of a strike against key sites from relatively close range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also several long-term risks to be considered. Russia’s exit from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty means that it can now more openly build ground-launched cruise missiles such as the SSC-8, as well as IRBMs. The launchers of such capabilities will likely be more survivable, and thus impose limits on left-of-launch solutions. Furthermore, if VLO UCAVs such as a successor to Russia’s Okhotnik or the Chinese GJ-11 become a part of their arsenal, the Russian Aerospace Forces may have an improved ability to strike targets such as air-defence radar, leading to the threat to emitting radar – currently primarily a problem at the tactical edge – becoming an issue at the operational and strategic levels. If, similarly, Russia develops a much larger intermediate-range ballistic arsenal (potentially through its increasing industrial collaboration with Iran and North Korea), the ballistic missile threat at strategic depth could become more significant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The threat to the homeland is likely to be most potent early in a conflict, when the value of strategic surprise is highest and NATO Joint Force Air Components (JFACs) and Maritime Component Commands are being stood up. After this, high-value targets will have dispersed, and many of the approaches to the UK will be covered by assets in the maritime domain, or by allies’ air-defence networks. The most important role for GBAD in a homeland defence context will thus be early in a conflict, when it can act as a last layer of point defence for critical targets. The ability to disincentivise surprise – which could be possible if a ship or submarine slipped allied maritime nets – will be an important pillar of deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The threat to ports, APODs, fuel and munitions storage sites, and command posts in Europe beyond the homeland will likely persist over the course of a conflict. Buried targets such as command posts will primarily need to be defended against HGVs, ballistic missiles and, to a lesser extent, cruise missiles. In contrast, softer-skinned targets are more likely to be engaged with a spectrum of threats, including one-way attack UAVs. Forward bastions such as Kaliningrad could allow Russia to use shorter-range missiles such as the 9M723 or the P-800 against targets that would normally have required medium- or intermediate-range missiles. Of course, not everything can always be protected, and priorities for protection will be determined in line with a Joint Prioritised and Defended Assets List. Air defences including GBAD will likely be most important in the early phases of a conflict, when a force is deploying, and near those nodes that are both critical and which cannot be defended by passive measures such as concealment, hardening or dispersion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In effect, then, there are two major roles for UK GBAD at the operational and strategic levels within Europe:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Providing a last layer of point defence for critical facilities within the homeland in the very early stages of a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Contributing to the defence of operational-level targets such as APODs, SPODs and headquarters in continental Europe for the duration of a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an expeditionary context, shorter-range threats may have operational-strategic significance. This stems from the fact that many theatres do not have the depth that Europe possesses. Additionally, in expeditionary contexts where power projection typically depends upon a local coalition partner, the homeland of this (usually nearby) state becomes a strategic target in the way one’s own homeland would in a territorial defence context in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, in the Persian Gulf, UAVs, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles are all capable of striking operationally and strategically relevant targets. The diffusion of precision strike capabilities means that many of the air threats currently emerging within Europe will likely also be faced in a wider range of contexts. For instance, Iran currently fields ballistic missiles such as the Zolfaghar, which has a CEP (circular error probable) of 10 metres, and the Fattah, a quasi-ballistic missile comparable to the Kinzhal. The proliferation of commercially available satellite imagery can, moreover, make the surveillance of fixed infrastructure and well-known chokepoints with relatively low data latency viable for a range of opponents, and not just peers. Finally, in geographically constrained theatres, comparatively cheap assets with a limited field of view (for example UAVs such as the Chinese-made Wing Loong) can also be used for surveillance and battle damage assessment near fixed infrastructure, enabling more responsive targeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having described the threat environment, we now turn to the question of the tools with which defenders can contend with the range of threats they will face, and the ways in which these tools can be integrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-surveying-the-tools-of-the-defence&quot;&gt;II. Surveying the Tools of the Defence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The preceding survey of the threat landscape that the UK’s IAMD must be able to contend with highlights some of the characteristics that are necessary for an effective defence. The spectrum of threats described necessitates a shift away from functional localisation – in which each system performs a defined task – towards a more distributed approach. In the latter context, effectiveness is determined at the system level, rather than through the platform-level metrics that presently characterise IAMD (such as the distance at which a target is detected, the number of shots possible, and missile Pk).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shift in focus implies the following sub-criteria for effectiveness:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because the sensors needed to classify the full spectrum of threats cannot be held at all echelons, British IAMD must be able to assign or leverage a range of British and allied systems (some of them not purpose-built for air defence) to detect, classify and track threats.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;British IAMD must also be able to assign the best positioned and most economical effector to engage a given threat.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The IAMD architecture must not be premised upon single points of failure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To meet evolving threats, the defensive architecture must be able to incorporate new sensors and effectors as these are iteratively developed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within this context, British Army GBAD will need to be designed around the following criteria:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Army GBAD must be able to both draw on and contribute to a joint and Alliance-level recognised air picture that enables assets organic to manoeuvre formations to leverage data from higher echelons (and vice versa).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since the army will not immediately own the range of effectors needed to intercept the full spectrum of threats, it must be able to contribute to a joint and allied defensive counter-air effort by reinforcing system-level effectiveness. It can do so by optimising against converging lower-tier threats, thus allowing other platforms to optimise against elements of the threat spectrum that still require bespoke solutions (such as ballistic missiles or HGVs). It can also accomplish this by reinforcing the resilience and agility of the overall C2 architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since new capabilities may be fielded, the army’s GBAD system must be sufficiently flexible to integrate systems it was not originally designed to incorporate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To assess how best to integrate the various components, it is first necessary to consider the sensors and effectors most relevant to engaging the identified threats. This too must be broken into tactical and operational-strategic targets, as there are different assumptions that can be made about the availability of power and the distances involved, which alter the available sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;tactical-defensive-systems-and-capabilities&quot;&gt;Tactical Defensive Systems and Capabilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defensive systems can be categorised in line with the threats that they counter, each of which presents different requirements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Low-level threats.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Medium-level threats.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;High-level threats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low-level threats&lt;/strong&gt; comprise tactical aviation, loitering munitions, cruise missiles and low-flying aircraft. In essence, these threats try to minimise their detectability and therefore targetability by using the curvature of the Earth and terrain masking as they approach their targets. The targeting methodology for countering these threats must be based upon detection and tracking over as great a distance as possible to understand their route before moving appropriate assets into position to interdict them. A system of mutually reinforcing methods of detection to enable this might be comprised of four layers, as described below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the force would benefit from early warning left of launch through national technical means. Understanding that a strike sortie is being prepared from an airbase, or that orders have been distributed to fire a loitering munition salvo in depth – whether through satellite imagery or signals intelligence (SIGINT) – allows the alert status of relevant systems to be brought into readiness. For example, US Northern Command expects to fuse data from multiple sources to detect preparations for ballistic missile launches several days in advance. If air defence assets are likely to have to move to be in position to achieve an intercept, early warning allows these mobile groups to prepare to move once an axis has been identified. This will be easier to achieve against some threat types, such as air-launched cruise missiles such as the Kh-101, which are launched from strategic bombers. While it is possible to track the launch platforms of submarine- and ground-launched cruise missiles, these are comparatively elusive. Even here, however, national technical means – particularly in areas like SIGINT – will be invaluable. The challenge is to distribute information to deployed GBAD headquarters at the appropriate classification, since Above Secret traffic is often hard to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, a sensor picket needs to have sufficient coverage to be able to detect and track threats as they approach their targets. Tactical echelons can draw on sensors likely to be held at the corps level or by other services. For example, an AN/TPY-2 radar organic to the THAAD system can spot relatively low-radar cross-section objects above 10,000 feet over a wide area at ranges of 250 km. The THAAD system is likely to be held at theatre level (or at the corps echelon at the very lowest), and operated by allies, but can provide critical early warning to tactical air defences. Airborne or elevated payloads able to provide track data to an effector can considerably expand a system’s reach without exposing operators on the ground. Such a sensor might be mounted on a balloon, a UAV, a helicopter or a mast. This class of sensor also includes airborne sensors such as the AN/APG-81 radar on the F-35, which are capable of effective discrimination against low-profile targets. Crucially, not all these sensors will be controlled by the Land Component Command, but their data, when available, will be important for target discrimination. The purpose of such a system would be to enable higher-end munitions to have track-quality data against low-flying targets such as helicopters and cruise missiles if they evaded the laydown of effectors on their anticipated flight path, and where the defensive system is not sitting as point defence for the intended target. This kind of integrated sensor picture should become easier to maintain as AESA radar proliferate, providing multifunctional payloads. Although such a multifunctional radar may not provide track-quality data, improved analytical tools are increasingly able to turn sub-track-quality data into a sufficiently reliable track to guide an intercept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third layer of situational awareness is drawn from sensors held by the tactical formations with which GBAD systems will operate and which they will protect. Since system-level effectiveness requires leveraging multiple types of data, GBAD can often benefit from drawing on sensors which are part of other formations, particularly when operators wish to avoid unmasking. These sensors include spectrometers (able to identify loitering munitions through their control frequencies and attack aviation through communications), acoustic sensors (able to detect the engine sound of low-flying objects), and passive coherent locating radar. There are a wide range of uses for these kinds of sensors. Spectrometers will be held by EW troops, while acoustic sensors can be used by artillery for counterbattery fire, and by manoeuvre elements for identifying enemy firing positions; if mounted on vehicles, they can also be distributed across the depth of a defence to provide updated tracks on munitions such as cruise missiles. Passive coherent location is more specialised, but is likely to become significantly more widespread, because of the requirement for units to self-protect from uncrewed aerial systems (UAS), while avoiding detection via direction-finding methods that can allow their positions to be inferred based on the signals they emit. The question is whether the detections from these sensors can be provided to the air defence system to offer a track for low-flying targets. This track is not sufficient to guide effectors, but is likely sufficient to accurately predict course and speed, and to cue other sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final component of the system may be understood as the sensors directly linked to effectors on the platforms attempting to achieve an intercept. An obvious example would be the Giraffe radar organic to a system such as Sky Sabre. In the case of UAVs, heavy machine guns on remote weapon stations should be able to slew to engage if appropriately programmed, using their electro-optical sensors; the trick would be to place these effectors on the flight path identified. In the case of MANPADS, which can be an economical means of engaging more capable UAVs and engaging cruise missiles, the electro-optical clue is sufficient. For aviation, high velocity missiles and lightweight multirole missiles are both viable munitions, as are 40-mm CTC cannon and other systems, provided the platform is aligned to anticipate the threat. This is easier said than done, however. In many instances, threats such as cruise missiles will be programmed to use flight paths that use terrain masking, and which allow them to approach their targets on circuitous routes, reducing warning times and confounding efforts to align platforms with threat vectors, thus reinforcing the importance of leveraging data from offboard sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medium- and high-level threats&lt;/strong&gt; comprising ballistic missiles and VLO aircraft (among others) will depend on a similar sensor architecture. The primary difference is that defending against these targets will impose a greater reliance on bespoke, rather than general, solutions. (Consideration of the threat from ballistic missiles is similar to the defence of operational-strategic assets, and so will be covered in the next section.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding VLO aircraft, different VLO implementations will have different exposure. The challenge lies in understanding the unique signature of these platforms, and in sifting that signature from the noise. One of the hardest things for an aircraft to mitigate, however, is its visual signature against the sky, such that image-recognition algorithms and electro-optical sensors can be paired to pick out VLO aircraft. Even so, the visibility of these aircraft does not necessarily mean that a missile can acquire a target: it may require beam riding or other solutions to enable an electro-optical camera to guide the munition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to a layered architecture for detection and classification, an IAMD system needs an appropriate mix of effectors. This mix includes: short-range solutions with high performance to defeat fast targets such as cruise missiles; short-range solutions with low performance to defeat threats such as loitering munitions; medium-range solutions able to close down approach axes to aviation and fast air; and long-range solutions that are able to defeat aircraft at high altitude, as well as providing point and area defence against tactical ballistic missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The British Army is unlikely to own the full spectrum of effectors, given the current budgetary allocation for GBAD. Many effectors relevant to tasks such as long-range air defence and BMD (Patriot, for instance) will be operated by allies. In terms of command relationships, medium- and upper-tier air defence systems will often fall under the control of the air and missile defence commander within the JFAC who exercises control over maritime platforms capable of BMD. This means that the army will also need to plan around the eventuality that some of the systems that it owns are not always protecting manoeuvre formations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, even when the British Army does not control allied and joint assets, the ability to draw data from them will be critical to performing many air defence functions, especially when the full spectrum of interceptors is not available because the air defence commander has tasked them elsewhere. As illustrated by the Iranian attacks on Al-Asad and Erbil, where early warning from the US’s Space-Based Infrared System and the Turkish-based AN/TPY-2 radar gave unprotected US forces time to take cover, an integrated system creates avenues to pursue reversionary mechanisms when resources are scarce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, land sensors can provide early warning and occasionally track to other systems under the JFAC. The G-AMB radar on Sky Sabre, for example, can provide data on an overflying cruise missile to an offshore destroyer to enable a remote engagement (interceptor ranges typically exceed sensor ranges). As such, those air defence capabilities that are organic to British ground formations and nearby allied forces can produce data for the theatre commander, rather than just ingesting it. In contexts where the British Army is providing a C2 structure for an allied ground force in a given part of a theatre, this necessitates the ability to both ingest data from British and allied assets and to pass it to the JFAC in a timely manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;defensive-systems-and-capabilities-at-the-operational-and-strategic-levels&quot;&gt;Defensive Systems and Capabilities at the Operational and Strategic Levels&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar layered sensor architecture is likely to be needed at the operational and strategic levels. Where possible, launch platforms will be identified by national technical means, while maintaining tracks on manoeuvring targets over a wide theatre will necessitate a reliance on offboard sources, including air-based systems. The primary differences between systems relevant to threats to targets in tactical and operational depth is that the latter requires tracking fast-moving targets such as ballistic missiles, which necessitates a greater reliance on dedicated radar, typically operating between the S-band and the X-band. The high speed of targets like ballistic missiles and HGVs makes the rapid acquisition of track-quality data a priority. Thus, the sensors relevant to this part of the detection and classification cycles must be activated and cued as quickly as possible. This, coupled with the relatively low risk of suppression at depth, incentivises a greater reliance on active radar organic to a system. That said, non-radar-based sensors will still be needed for tasks such as discriminating targets from decoys in their terminal phase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The type of UK GBAD equipment likely to be procured under the current equipment plan will not have the organic sensors needed to track many of the threats the UK will face, and the interceptors to deal with several classes of threat will also be lacking. For example, under current plans, the UK will have no ground-based BMD or counter-hypersonic capability, creating a capability gap which will need to be addressed as part of a wider IAMD strategy. Under present assumptions, the land-based component of UK IAMD will only be functional at the operational and strategic levels of warfare, in tandem with joint force and allied assets. This is not to say that UK GBAD cannot play an important supporting role, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussed in previous sections, cruise missiles constitute the primary threat at the strategic level. Assuming that the RN is able to provide at least one Type 45 (or, in the future, Type 83) destroyer for BMD missions, the army and the RAF can facilitate the RN’s limited VLS capacity being allocated to BMD by respectively providing point and area defence against cruise missiles. The RAF, which can respond across a wide area with its Typhoon aircraft, is best suited to area defence, while army MRAD and SHORAD can provide point defence for key nodes. If the threat evolves to include a larger number of adversary IRBMs or a limited number of conventionally armed HGVs, there may be a case for a national BMD or counter-hypersonic capability equivalent to Arrow-3 (which Germany has purchased for this role). Given the difficulties inherent in developing a domestic solution, this would mean a potential requirement to integrate new (and likely non-UK) capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that the Land GBAD programme could have a disproportionate cognitive impact on enemy planning for operational and strategic strikes. If, for example, the enemy assesses that key RAF bases are undefended, then the risk/reward calculus in conducting a small-scale raid with long-range bombers may appear more attractive. Although the strike platform could be lost, the probability of effect on target if the missiles were launched would be high. If, by contrast, the enemy must plan on the basis of GBAD providing point defence to these facilities, then the size of sortie that must be generated to be confident of achieving an effect alters the risk/reward calculus. Moreover, the inability to determine which munitions would succeed in striking which targets – even as part of a large salvo – would make the impact on the target unpredictable. In this way, relatively small investments in GBAD have the potential to significantly alter how attractive targets in the UK appear to the enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the operational level within Europe, as well as on expeditionary missions, the threat environment will be more complex, comprising SRBMs, cruise missiles, loitering munitions and fixed-wing threats. In these contexts, in addition to providing sensors and effectors against certain threat types, the British Army can add greatest value to what is likely to be an Allied or coalition system by reinforcing that system’s capacity to coordinate its disparate elements and to retain its coherence in the face of disruption. In terms of effectors, it is worth noting that Sky Sabre is particularly well-suited to being assigned intercepts of cruise missiles targeting key sites, and this layer of defence is something the British Army can offer to allies. The key requirements for UK GBAD at the operational/strategic levels are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Providing a data fusion node and reversionary C2 mechanism to coordinate sensors and effectors that reside under the joint force or allied control.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Countering the lower-tier elements of the threat spectrum to allow other assets to optimise against upper-tier threats.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar classification of target types – high-, medium- and low-altitude – can be adopted to that used at the tactical level, with the caveat that at the operational/strategic level, targets such as HGVs will blur distinctions. The balance of relatively bespoke sensors needed to track many operational threats means that they will be national or Alliance assets. Moreover, planned ground-based platforms will not, for the foreseeable future, carry hit-to-kill interceptors, meaning that the UK’s BMD capability will be primarily maritime. Effectors that can be used in counter-hypersonics, such as glide phase interceptors, are also not currently envisioned, and will likely be held by allies (and potentially by the RN).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of C2, key capabilities at the operational/strategic level will likely fall under a NATO Air Component Command (ACC). This could be true for Sky Sabre, if authority over it is transferred to the NATO C2 structure, but also for lower-tier capabilities that may be required to act as “gate guardians” protecting long-range air and missile defence systems from low-flying threats – such as UAVs that underfly their radar. The UK has insufficient Sky Sabre systems at present, and would face severe overstretch in trying to protect a combination of UK sites, deployed forces and NATO. In exercises, the assumption is often that UK Sky Sabre would be under divisional command. This is not a sound planning assumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While in many instances, British land forces will not directly command joint and allied assets, they can reinforce the resilience of joint and allied C2. The allied C2 nodes that provide overall coherence will likely be targeted and may be struck; to degrade gracefully, a system must have nodes which can control locally adjacent assets in the absence of higher-level C2, and coordinate with other similarly situated command capabilities if needed. This requires the existence of reversionary command posts, and for the bearers to transfer data to and from them. For example, in the context of the Russian integrated air defence system, battalion-level data fusion and C2 nodes such as the D4M1 Polyana and the 55K6E can allow both the coordination of assets and the fusion of data even if higher-echelon command posts are knocked out. Developments in areas such as software-defined signal processing, illustrated by programmes such as DARPA’s (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) Dynamo, show the ways in which improvements in processing power will make networking across waveforms easier over time. The US Army’s Integrated Battle Command System has coordinated multiple disparate assets at its engagement operations centres, routing data either through gateways or through third-party platforms that can receive certain waveforms and retransmit them at compatible frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if the army C2 construct supporting air defence does not own many of the most relevant sensors and effectors, it should be able to reinforce the resilience of an allied or coalition system by coordinating elements of an operational-level defence over a given sector of a theatre (within Europe) or the entirety of a smaller theatre (at reach) on a reversionary basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to reversionary C2, the British Army should be capable of contributing to a shared recognised air picture at army deep and beyond. In the context of cruise missile defence, the army can do this with its own sensors; when forward deployed with manoeuvre formations, these sensors can feed data back about targets – such as cruise missiles which overfly them. In the context of BMD missions, the army’s lack of BMD-capable radar can be offset by a C2 architecture that allows it to incorporate data from BMD-capable allied tactical assets (such as the G/ATOR), enabling it to relay this information to higher echelons when it is needed without their being overwhelmed by data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since it is uneconomical in terms of data management to have these platforms feeding into CAOCs or maritime air operations centres on a persistent basis, one way for their utility to be leveraged when they are needed for IAMD is for the GBAD C2 architecture to mediate data flows. As such, both BMD and counter-hypersonics require that UK GBAD C2 must be capable of distributing relevant data to higher echelons on a time-sensitive basis. It may also become necessary to share data with national civil defence authorities (much as the Israel Defense Forces do with Israel’s Home Front Command), especially if not every inch of national soil can be defended. In undefended areas, air defence can still contribute to warning mechanisms, as in the app-based systems used in Israel and Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, army air defences can optimise for point defence against cruise missiles, aircraft and loitering munitions. This will be important both to allow other joint and allied force elements to optimise against upper-tier threats, and to defend the very systems that enable tasks like BMD (since many defensive systems optimised for higher-tier threats are themselves vulnerable to low-flying ones). Consider, for example, a 2017 incident in which a North Korean UAV was found crashed near South Korea’s THAAD site, having flown there unobserved. Several types of sensor may be relevant to this function. First, radar can be combined with methods of detection such as electro-optical and IR sensors. These sensors can usefully aid discrimination against targets that carry countermeasures optimised to defeat radar. Secondly, and as at the tactical level, elevated radar can considerably expand coverage and thus system alertness (the British Army holds several G-AMB radar, unattached to Sky Sabre batteries, that could contribute to this role). While radar suppression at depth is relatively unlikely, the fact that it may become more likely could also incentivise drawing on sources such as civilian radar to complicate the task of suppression and limit the time for which a dedicated military radar must emit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The range of capabilities needed to contend with a complex threat environment makes their effective coordination a complex organisational and systems-engineering task. It is to the question of how this task might be accomplished that the paper now turns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-requirements-for-land-gbad-c2&quot;&gt;III. Requirements for Land GBAD C2&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having considered the span of threats that a future Land GBAD C2 architecture must be able to manage, and the breadth of sensors and effectors that tackling these threats may need to draw upon, it becomes possible to outline some characteristics of a future-proof C2 architecture. This chapter outlines these requirements, both in terms of the systems the C2 architecture must integrate, and where decision-making is located.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;moving-beyond-integral-c2-relationships&quot;&gt;Moving Beyond Integral C2 Relationships&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The British Army is fundamentally an expeditionary force, and this is critical to its utility to the British state. By offering partners and allies reinforcement, the British military allows threats to be contested at reach. The challenges of force projection mean that the British military often finds itself deployed without all its equipment, and that the exact timeline on equipment availability is shaped by the distance at which it is projected and the available infrastructure. Furthermore, while land forces may provide a key contribution in some theatres, the capabilities relevant to tasks such as defence against tactical ballistic missiles may be maritime, or a partner capability. The key point is that when the UK fights, it necessarily does so as a joint and multinational force – and this is especially true in the context of air defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as having an expeditionary character, the British military is also becoming more dependent upon – and integrated with – its partners and allies. During the First World War, Lord Kitchener directly instructed that the British Expeditionary Force was to remain under independent command, such that deconfliction with French and Belgian forces was largely achieved through the allocation of battlespace. Processes have moved on since then, and NATO C2 has long functioned on the presumption of combined air operations, multinational joint effects, and Alliance-level planning. Nonetheless, C2 has – historically – been simplified by echelons and battlespace being divided between countries. This approach has made sense, since different echelons operating fixed areas of interest could be determined by the range limitations of their sensors and effectors. Today, however, all echelons can reach and strike into operational depth, while all echelons also have access to ISR into strategic depth. In a context where effects from all echelons can be applied across one another’s boundaries, battlespace management has thus become more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The criticality of being able to integrate or at a minimum interoperate with allied systems is further demonstrated by the implications of a protracted conflict. It is possible, for example, that a high-performance system with limited interoperability could offer a tactical advantage early in a conflict. But experience in Ukraine has demonstrated that as a war becomes more protracted, new systems are developed, and that dependencies on allies change as stockpiles, production rates and rationalisation change both what is available and what is produced. This dynamic may even extend to adapting air-to-air munitions to fire from the ground, or using air-to-ground munitions to fire against air targets. It follows, then, that the C2 system must be able to continue working with sensors and effectors, even as the assets assigned to the system change over time and are adapted to meet demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even a cursory examination of the sensors outlined in the previous chapter demonstrates that some of them are exquisite air defence assets (and likely permanently under the control of the air defence formation). The majority of sensors are, however, primarily tasked against other problem sets. A vehicle’s acoustic sensors, for example, are placed on the combat vehicle to detect enemy vehicle movement and origin of shot; that these sensors can provide a screen to detect enemy UAS is invaluable, but only if the C2 system can enable data to be moved to the relevant effector. Another element of the challenge is that against a low-flying threat such as a cruise missile, a passive radar on a C-UAS system forward may be able to track the munition for as much as 60 km of its flight, even while a higher-echelon air defence radar is prevented from doing so by terrain or by system characteristics – and yet it may be the higher echelon system that has the effector. Whether the track data can be passed from the forward sensor and refined sufficiently to provide a guidance solution is dependent upon latency and on the compatibility of data between systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, effectors may be held either by the air defence organisation organic to a manoeuvre formation or by an ACC. In addition to dedicated effectors, there is also a plethora of non-dedicated systems such as jammers, multispectral smoke and DRFM (digital radio frequency memory) decoys, which will not be under the direct control of the air defence organisations at any level, but which can nevertheless contribute to air defence. Coordination with these capabilities will be critical to ensure deconfliction and the economisation of interceptor expenditure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the battlefield is increasingly flooded with sensors, many mounted on uncrewed platforms, opportunities will emerge for 7 Air Defence Group to reach beyond its own capabilities. However, the battlespace will also become more cluttered, particularly at the FLOT, as more elements of the force employ UAS. Indeed, UAS are destined to become ubiquitous at all echelons in the British Army, and the tactical context of their employment means that most UAS flights will not be cleared with the CAOC or planned in accordance with the air tasking order (ATO). In Ukraine, a significant proportion of higher-echelon UAS losses derive from friendly fire (for Russian and Ukrainian forces alike). Nor is it necessarily viable to have IFF (Identification Friend or Foe) as a widespread capability on UAS, both because they are likely to be captured in significant numbers, creating opportunities for the adversary to pass themselves off as friendly, but also because of the price-point dynamics on most UAS platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the UK, the central point is that Strategic Command must exercise influence over C2 for the Land GBAD programme to ensure that it is compatible with developments within the army and across the other services, and critically that the UK’s Multi-Domain Integrated Systems programme addresses the problem of blue-force tracking in the context of expanded UAS and C-UAS coverage across the battlefield. The risk of fratricide in an environment saturated with aerial objects is real, and is amplified as air defence elements become required Tom Keatinge is the Director of the Centre for Finance and Security at RUSI.tooperate in isolation. During the invasion of Iraq in 2003, for example, isolated Patriot batteries – lacking wider situational awareness – were responsible for shootdowns of friendly aircraft. Brokering situational awareness to minimise the risk of misclassification of targets will be a major task for air defenders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the light of these requirements, an effective fire-control C2 architecture must be able to manage three kinds of data relationship:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Integral.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Habitual.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Incidental.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integral&lt;/strong&gt; relationships can be thought of as the fixed, low-latency C2 links between air defence assets held under organic command by the headquarters. This is the type of relationship with which air defence operators across the force are currently most familiar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Habitual&lt;/strong&gt; links, meanwhile, constitute air defence assets whose primary responsibility is the point defence or force protection of other elements of the force. These elements would usually be subordinated to the unit they are supporting, but they would benefit from the common air picture, and sometimes may also benefit from warnings provided by higher-echelon sensors under the control of the air defence headquarters. On occasion, however, these assets’ sensors may be critical to a successful air defence engagement overflying their area of responsibility, or their effectors may need to be moved to put them in position to intercept a threat against higher echelons. These units, therefore, must become habituated to having their systems periodically connected to the air defence C2 architecture, with as low a latency as possible. An obvious example would be the relationship between air defences afloat and those ashore – a relationship that should also extend to GBAD. In an Alliance context where UK GBAD platforms find themselves reallocated alongside Allied systems to support the assessed main line of effort, habitual relationships with Allied platforms will emerge, such as between Sky Sabre and Polish SA-6 systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incidental&lt;/strong&gt; links differ from the other two categories because they comprise those units that are not primarily responsible for air defence, but which may become reliant on the air defence command for the purposes of synchronising and timing their countermeasures, or because they have incidentally collected information relevant to air defence and are seeking to share it with the headquarters. Latency requirements in this context may be more relaxed. Bearers are almost certainly non-bespoke and are used by many parts of the force, but there must be a means for priority information to be routed appropriately when these situations arise. An obvious example of such a relationship would be with the sensors of aircraft that share the battlespace with GBAD systems. The incidental relationship can also run the other way, with data from air defence radar being used to extrapolate launcher locations and thus enable suppression by artillery or an over-the-horizon aircraft, for example. This approach is central to both Israeli concepts of operations and to South Korea’s “Kill Chain” system of IAMD and strike assets. While some radar are explicitly designed to determine launch points, even those that are not can narrow the search parameters for other sensors if they can track enough of a missile’s trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-technical-demands-of-context-driven-c2&quot;&gt;The Technical Demands of Context-Driven C2&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three organisational/technical barriers that must be overcome if British GBAD is to manage the requisite range of relationships. First, data must be passed across alliances and coalition partners which operate a range of systems. In the context of maritime BMD, data sharing between allied systems has proven to be a considerable (but not insurmountable) systems-engineering challenge, a point illustrated over the course of multiple iterations of Exercise Formidable Shield. National caveats are also a concern. One example of these (albeit not from the world of IAMD) is that in the past it has been difficult for allied assets to plug in to a US carrier battlegroup because SIPRNet was a no-foreign-nationals network; even when this ceased to be the case, foreign access remained tightly controlled. Classification boundaries will also need to be surmounted within the joint force if data from sources such as the F-35 is to be leveraged. Alongside the challenge of processing data, a GBAD system will need to move and receive data across heterogeneous networks, where the available bearer is dependent on the line of effort that it is supporting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final challenge that will need to be overcome is the likelihood of capability growth that cannot be perfectly anticipated. For example, the army might invest in an upper-tier defensive system if the task of BMD becomes too much of a drain on RN resources, or it might incorporate directed-energy weapons into its SHORAD architecture. Critically, if SHORAD solutions against C-UAS become highly effective, the demand for UAS to be fitted with IFF will increase, thus expanding the need for C2 over these capabilities. A C2 system’s effectiveness will be determined by its capacity for iterative adaptation such that it can incorporate new sensors, effectors and processes. One of the great successes of the Aegis system, for example, is that its design process presumed that the system would prioritise the capacity for iterative change as new baselines were introduced, even if this meant setting initially conservative goals in capability terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on these three challenges, the following design principles for army C2 for air defence assets can be derived:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the system must be capable of translating data across formats at pace. The heterogeneity of the systems operated by allies and coalition partners with which the air defence network must integrate, as well as the need to draw data from a range of sources within the joint force, makes this a sine qua non. In coalition contexts, the heterogeneity of systems will be even more significant, as potential partners such as the UAE operate the Korean L-SAM and the Russian Pantsir. It is also important to emphasise the importance of being able to fuse the feeds from sources that are incidentally related to air defence with organic sensors and effectors. For example, if the effector that is most likely to intercept a target is an organic one, but the rough track data is being provided by a joint asset, while precise track data is being enabled by lining up sensors along the vector of threat, then data from several sources needs to be fused to provide a target solution to the effector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since coordination in capability development across the joint force and allies is unlikely, it follows that the system must depend on backwards integration. This necessitates an architecture that can be regularly updated with middleware to provide additional translation layers as required. As an example, we might think of how software such as BMD Flex was designed to connect Aegis and non-Aegis systems afloat. Another example could be the recent tests by the US Army at its White Sands Range, which connected Patriot with both F-35s and a range of bespoke systems from beyond the army. The hardware requirements that this approach introduces in areas such as processing power will create requirements for thermal and electromagnetic shielding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the data processing architecture of the system must be able to receive data without access to the commercially and militarily sensitive underlying source codes that underpin a given system and its architecture. Without this ability, it will be largely impossible to receive data across coalitions, given likely sensitivities about data exposure, and this may even create impediments within an Alliance context. To the extent that partners can share messages without foundational knowledge, this will be easier. This logic underpins publish/subscribe models in the commercial world, where an enterprise integration bus facilitates the translation of data across formats and acts as a messaging broker. Such systems rely on each publisher placing its raw data (messages) within a shared environment from which they can be translated and pushed on to hosted subscriber platforms. This model requires minimal compatibility in terms of data structuring, and is generally flexible in terms of the specific language types that can be incorporated. Because messaging is brokered through a central data environment, it does not require subscribers or publishers to receive data from one another directly – simplifying the systems engineering challenge that emerges from the addition of new system nodes (sometimes referred to as the N-squared challenge) because platforms do not need to “talk” directly to each other. The use of a central data environment also means that specific coalition partners do not share information directly (an issue that can sometimes prove politically challenging). Examples where this kind of integration already exists include the US military’s universal C2 interface. Any system will also need mechanisms for moving data across classifications within the joint force (for example, the US tests linking F-35s to Patriot were facilitated by an Einstein box on a U-2 Dragon Lady aircraft).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The network architecture for air defence must be a heterogeneous one, since the fusion of sensor data and the distribution of a common air picture to units not habitually part of the air defence structure will have to rely on the bearers they already possess, rather than on bespoke bearers. Even for those systems that have habitual but not integral relationships with one another, the fact that a defensive system’s deployment will partly be determined by the forces it is supporting means that the operators of these systems cannot control precisely what bearers may be available at a given time to route information to the air defence headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several solutions are possible. The most obvious would be a software-defined system that can incorporate multiple waveform cards at a central node. However, other palliatives might be more appropriate. Data can be routed to a common node via third-party platforms that receive and retransmit waveforms. This will be especially important when the sensitivity of a network such as MADL (Multifunction Advanced Data Link) means that not every system can have a receiving terminal. Software-defined signal processing might be another way of allowing a system to receive data across multiple waveforms without a requirement for an unmanageable number of waveform cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latency requirements present another challenge: when a habitual connection is taken under command by either the air commander or the headquarters of a formation-level air defence, that connection must take priority on the bearer of opportunity it adopts. The disruption this could cause makes it important that the air defence command exercises restraint and maturity over when it asserts this need for priority, otherwise commanders will likely seek to shield their comms from being available to the air defence headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;organisational-requirements-for-the-command-team&quot;&gt;Organisational Requirements for the Command Team&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, this paper has focused on the system being commanded and how its multiple components must be able to interact. The future threat environment, however, also imposes constraints on the size, disposition and structure of the command team that must operate the GBAD C2 system, and it is important to capture these requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, there are a series of vital nodes that the GBAD enterprise must be able to liaise with and draw data from. This is most realistically achieved through established data links, but also through liaison cells with terminals that can replicate the air defence command’s displays and from which data can also be inputted. The relevant points of presence across the force are likely to be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Joint Effects cell in the divisional headquarters responsible for planning and controlling divisional fires. In some instances, destroying enemy strike systems on the ground may be a better means of sanitising airspace, and so the air defence organisation may cooperate on triangulating the location of threat systems. There is also the need to be notified of UAS orbits and EW plans.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC) headquarters, and its J5 and J3 fires elements, to ensure that the air defence laydown protects points critical to the corps, and to avoid fratricide, in terms of both air defence engagements and route planning. It is notable, for example, that the defensive plan for 1 German Corps in 1988 Federal Republic of Germany war plans saw the corps logistics area accidentally co-located with the Luftwaffe’s hawk batteries, due to a failure to compare the schemes of manoeuvre between these respective formations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The CAOC where the ATO is generated must be a priority liaison, both to ensure that blue forces are accurately tracked and to benefit from the vast ISR capacity within the air operations enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The commander of the Maritime Component Command, both to benefit from maritime ISR, and because the UK’s BMD capability both for forces at the edge and targets at depth will be, for now at least, at sea.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1 Aviation Brigade, as an organisation that will be generating sorties in support of land forces and controlling air-launched effects, must also be closely tied into the enterprise. Defence of aviation assets on the ground also creates a key responsibility for GBAD units.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Representation in the G5 and G3 shops of the divisional headquarters is critical, so that the distribution and laydown of air defence assets can be planned and deconflicted, and be complementary to the divisional scheme of manoeuvre. It also allows the enterprise to plan the resupply and sustainment of air defence units.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Allied formations and air defence units also require liaison personnel to share a common understanding of the environment and to deconflict or coordinate engagement where effector or sensor coverage overlaps. In NATO this can be formalised, but in the Middle East or other operating environments liaison may have to be ad hoc.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is also a range of sensors built into civilian infrastructure (and operated by civilian agencies) in a number of states where the UK might operate, which could provide critical situational awareness and which would require liaison.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK’s GBAD C2 structures have, historically, met the following obligations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The capacity to provide a corps-level command element subordinate to HQ ARRC air branch.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A divisional air defence command formed around one of the air defence regiments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A brigade-level air defence cell.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Liaison with national air defence C2.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the C2 of army GBAD is to expand its span of control to provide a wrap for joint and allied capabilities, there is an inherent challenge: the regular force, as it currently exists (12th and 16th Regiments of the Royal Artillery within 7 Air Defence Group) is too small to staff all the liaison functions outlined above. Moreover, air defence officers in the British military are largely generalists, on account of the career structure within the Royal Artillery, whereas the expertise needed to understand partner C2 systems sufficiently to function as an effective liaison requires extensive specialist knowledge and experience. A critical requirement for robust C2 of future GBAD, therefore, is a career structure that can produce staff with the relevant experience and expertise. The expanded responsibility of UK air defence is not simply an army aspiration, or gold plating, but a UK obligation under the country’s commitment to NATO, which includes the ARRC as a Reserve Corps headquarters. As the army is also seeking to field two divisions, the planning assumption for the staffing of 7 Air Defence Group – that it contributes to the fielding of one warfighting division – is no longer valid. The interface of GBAD with the corps echelon is also reinforced by the growing emphasis on corps operations among allies, as a result of US Multi-Domain Operations and the aspiration to leverage data from F-35 and other capabilities, which is difficult to achieve at the divisional level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, an alternative command structure might include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The technical basis for a corps-level command element, along with a skeleton staff that can be augmented by partners.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A divisional-level command formed around a regiment, and brigade-level cells below it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The aforementioned liaison network.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several ways in which the headcount required to deliver these capabilities can be minimised. Firstly, automation (while not a panacea) can reduce specific burdens and extend an operator’s span of control. A formation of destroyers, for example, has six officers on watch in each destroyer, with the anti-air warfare officer supervising a team of as few as two to three personnel. This formation is expected to perform theatre air and missile defence over areas sometimes spanning hundreds of kilometres. Although this is partly a function of overall command being held elsewhere, it also reflects the fact that most modern destroyers are capable of operating on a partially or fully automated basis, meaning they can independently conduct an air defence battle over an area comparable to a corps’ – or even a field army’s – area of responsibility. While the power and processing requirements involved have historically made this more applicable to the maritime domain, where large ships could support this model, the continued miniaturisation of microprocessors is making significantly greater computational capacity deployable in distributed ISO containers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, liaison officers to allied air defence formations and other allied formations, or to air and maritime component commands, can, if the role is professionalised, act as a force multiplier for joint planning (an analogy might be drawn with the way tactical air controllers are trained within the army). Having such individuals in post would represent an important bridge across organisations and, moreover, cycling officers through liaison roles could provide the organisational capital needed to create a skeleton air defence cell into which allied officers and liaisons from across the joint force could be plugged, if needed. A more ambitious approach to personnel interoperability might see officers from the navy and air force sit alongside army officers for training as part of a joint air defence course (as Joint Terminal Attack Controllers from the British Army and RAF do), so that they can be moved afloat or ashore as appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A complicating factor for C2 activities is that, historically, these activities would have occurred at fixed locations where the air defence headquarters could have a presence. However, owing to the threat from long-range precision fires, many of the constituent parts of the C2 system are themselves being dispersed in smaller packets. This places a premium on data transfer and compatibility between these formations’ C2 tools and the air defence system. There is also a trade-off to be made: although officers in distributed C2 nodes can gain access to the wider data sets from other similarly distributed nodes, they are unable to physically meet with other elements. The ability to ingest and dispense data becomes critical, therefore, to their utility to both the air defence command and the headquarters to which they are attached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adversaries’ expanding capacity to reach into tactical and operational depth means that air defence is now a critical enabler for ground forces, even after the establishment of air superiority. Moreover, given the number and diversity of low-cost air threats, and the competing dilemmas imposed by more capable threat systems, C2 has become the means by which an air defence system can gain the required efficiency to protect the force. This efficiency is derived from assigning appropriate effectors to the different kinds of threat being confronted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve the requisite efficiency, the C2 architecture for British GBAD must be able to distribute track-quality data to a diverse array of organic/inorganic systems and joint/combined assets. Given the increasing number of low-altitude threat systems, this track-quality data will often need to be based upon a composite track derived from numerous bespoke and contingent sensors. The collection and distribution of this data must, moreover, be bearer agnostic, reflecting the fact that partners may use an array of communications systems, and that the best-placed sensors might be embedded in units that are not organically subordinated to the air defence formation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further consideration is that both effectors and sensors are likely to adapt rapidly over the course of a conflict in anticipation of and response to an evolving threat. Expenditure of munitions will also invariably drive the use of increasingly irregular interceptors as a conflict protracts. The C2 architecture must therefore be adaptable, so as to be capable of interacting with new systems via software updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The C2 architecture itself must be distributed, both to bolster its own survivability and because it must have liaison outposts in disparate formations. Moreover, as the number of friendly UAS and effectors in the operating environment expands (many lacking synchronisation through the CAOC), the ability to access friendly planning cycles to aid with the classification of air targets is vital if the air defence system is not to engage in widespread friendly fire. Another major consideration is the mobility, signature and power requirements of the C2 system, since it risks being targeted if it has a distinct signature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has not covered C-UAS capabilities in detail, focusing instead on loitering munitions and one-way attack UAS, as these target air defences or the sites they defend. The layers of tactical UAS that are likely to become organic to all echelons, however, have not been discussed, because defence against these systems is a localised all-arms requirement, rather than something to be managed centrally. Nevertheless, one of the key ancillary questions is how the air defence network can make opportunistic use of the sensors and effectors distributed throughout the force to provide all-arms C-UAS without saturating tactical networks or hijacking a critical enabler of manoeuvre elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Land GBAD programme gives the British Army an opportunity to future-proof air defence across the joint and combined force, with £1.6 billion committed to the project. But realising the programme’s goals will depend on having an open-architecture C2 capability that can integrate the increasing numbers and types of sensors that are proliferating across the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指黎智英不同意年青人組新政黨-因會令社運變質&quot;&gt;陳梓華指黎智英不同意年青人組新政黨 因會令社運變質&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華昨日供稱在2019年11月27日，他與黎智英第三次會面，當時黎提及區選民主派大勝、會見張崑陽，以及眾籌能夠突破傳統框架。陳今早再補充，黎在該次會面中還有提及「佢支持本土嘅力量」，也提及「當時有一個聲音話想另起爐灶，組織新嘅政黨」，惟黎表示不同意，「佢話歷史上嘅經驗係，如果當啲年青人去自己再組織政黨嘅話，就會令到個社會運動變質。」陳指黎認為年青人應該以泛民的思想為中心去爭取民主。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳昨日引述黎講過應該結合街頭、議會和國際力量，延續反修例運動的熱情，迫使政府回應市長訴求。控方追問黎有否提及如何結合三方的力量。陳指黎想建立一個「領袖團隊」，而當中的領袖便是來自上述三個板塊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指李宇軒籌備監選團需額外25萬-暗示陳向mark-simon尋求資助&quot;&gt;陳梓華指李宇軒籌備監選團需額外25萬 「暗示」陳向Mark Simon尋求資助&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就2019年11月24日的區議會選舉，陳梓華供稱，另一名被告李宇軒事前透過 Telegram Call 告訴他，正計劃籌備一個監察區議會選舉行動（Election Observation Mission，簡稱EOM），「然後佢話佢唔夠錢搞，當時我問佢爭幾多錢，佢話25萬，然後佢問我可唔可以幫手。」陳表示，雖然當時李並沒有明確說出要求，但是「我理解佢暗示我，叫我搵 Mark Simon 或者黎智英」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指他其後聯絡 Mark Simon，轉述李宇軒想籌備監選行動，「Mark Simon 好有興趣，想我講個內容做啲乜嘢、幾時做、點樣做，同埋點解要25萬。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳遂再次致電李宇軒，首先問他：「點解你哋唔直接聯絡？你哋已經見過面，亦都交換咗聯絡方式」，惟李僅回應：「你去講好啲」，然後談及監選行動的目的。陳引述李指，本身只是一名外國議員想前來香港監察選舉，「但係後來佢哋團隊討論過，應該係攬炒團隊，佢哋決定咗將佢發大嚟搞」，所以他們開始邀請不同外國議員，會有英國、日本和澳洲，另外會嘗試邀請美國，故此需要額外25萬元經費，用以支付機票和酒店費用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指mark-simon大力支持-最終贊助李宇軒50萬元籌辦監選團&quot;&gt;陳梓華指Mark Simon「大力支持」 最終贊助李宇軒50萬元籌辦監選團&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，他將李宇軒製作的來港議員名單轉發給 Mark Simon，不久後 Mark Simon 致電陳，問：「Even Lord Alton is coming?」陳向李查問後，向 Mark Simon 確認 Lord Alton 會來港，於是 Mark Simon 答應幫助，並稱：「我哋會大力支持。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;後來陳從李口中得悉 Mark Simon 給了50萬元，即是雙倍贊助。陳憶述他當時向李打趣道：「佢（Mark Simon）都冇咁樣畀過50萬我」、「你好犀利。」然後李說：「呢樣都唔犀利」，陳指：「佢（李宇軒）話另一個人仲 resourceful，就係 Wilson Li（李宗澤），佢話佢可以 arrange 到嗰啲酒店，畀佢搞到呢場EOM。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華mark-simon指李宇軒唔係好識做人-冀陳能繼續居中協調&quot;&gt;陳梓華：Mark Simon指李宇軒「唔係好識做人」 冀陳能繼續居中協調&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華供稱，區選之後，他於2019年12月頭在沙田君悅酒店與 Mark Simon 見面，為二人第二次親身見面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳引述 Mark Simon 在會面中提及區選監選團：「佢認為做得好好，呢啲就係佢哋想要嘅嘢」，而「佢哋」是指黎智英和 Mark Simon。陳指 Mark Simon 繼而說：「其實呢，好多民主人士會去聯絡佢，或者佢個老細，去尋求金錢上嘅幫助。咁但係呢，我老細好有錢，唔代表佢任何人都要贊助。細額嘅款項佢都可以決定，但係大額呢，就需要佢個老闆決定。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指：「跟住佢（Mark Simon）就話，李宇軒呢，每次都係最後一刻先搵人或者佢幫手，就話佢唔係好識做人，咁所以希望我可以繼續喺中間協調佢哋兩個。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指 Mark Simon 亦談論他與李的未來方向，「如果未來做文宣嘅話呢，咁應該呢就放棄登報紙喇。應該要做嘅，係喺網上嘅平台宣傳啦，同埋國際游說嘅工作，佢（Mark）認為更有成效。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問為何 Mark Simon 認為要放棄登報紙，陳引述 Mark 當時指：「唔係個個都會讀報紙，而且其實已經好多人關注香港嘅事，唔需要靠登報紙嚟引起關注，反而係啲（外國）官員呀，同埋政府，會更加想知道香港嘅情況係點樣，所以先更加需要國際游說。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又追問國際游說想達到什麼目的。陳指希望國際社會採取措施，去迫使政府回應市民訴求，包括撤回修例和落實雙普選。惟 Mark 並未有提及想外國採取什麼「措施」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指黎智英和mark-simon區選後研究初選-冀立法會選舉再次大勝&quot;&gt;陳梓華指黎智英和Mark Simon區選後研究初選 冀立法會選舉再次大勝&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳另引述 Mark Simon 覺得「黃絲勝選係大勢所趨嘅」，亦聲稱「佢同佢老細都開始研究緊初選，就希望延續呢股氣勢」，能夠在2020年的立法會選舉再次取得大勝。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;初選47人案的主審法官之一李運騰此時打斷，指該次對話是在2019年12月發生，問陳是否早於當時便已經有人談論初選。陳回答，後來2020年1月的時候，他與黎智英在台灣見面，期間黎有提及初選，甚至已經向一間歐洲公司索取報價，研發一個初選公投程式，而黎聲稱他們其實在2019年11至12月已經講過初選的主意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱黎智英和mark-simon轉讓離岸公司銀行戶口給他作為報酬&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱黎智英和Mark Simon轉讓離岸公司銀行戶口給他作為「報酬」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳早前供稱，在第一次與 Mark Simon 見面時，Mark 表示可以幫助他開設離岸公司的銀行戶口，「你就當係個獎勵畀自己。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指第二次見面時，Mark Simon 發現原來在香港很難開設離岸公司的銀行戶口，所以無法幫助陳，「但係佢（Mark）有問過，佢就話佢哋手頭上有兩間空置嘅⋯⋯佢話可以畀其中一間我。」陳並確認這當作是黎智英和 Mark Simon 給他的「報酬（reward）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指 Mark Simon 介紹了一名叫 Evan Lau 的助手，去跟進海外公司轉讓事宜，涉及一間在英屬維爾京群島註冊的公司 LACOCK 及一個本地銀行戶口。陳稱他於2020年1月到壹傳媒大樓簽署文件，期間他留意到文件上有一個簽名，查問下得悉該簽名屬於黎智英。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又展示 LACOCK 的匯豐銀行本地戶口，顯示直至2019年11月30日，戶口存款為8萬元，至2020年2月7日，銀行扣除辦理轉讓的200元手續費之後，存款最終為79,800元。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，根據控辯雙方承認事實，在2018年4月26日至2020年1月13日之間，黎智英、Mark Simon 和前壹傳媒財務總裁周達權是 LACOCK 銀行戶口的授權簽署人。由2020年1月14日開始，該銀行戶口唯一授權簽署人轉為陳梓華。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問及陳有否和 Mark Simon 討論如何處理8萬元存款。陳指 Mark Simon 當時以為戶口只有5萬元，並要求陳以現金方式把該8萬元還給他，惟直至陳被捕之前也未還款。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指mark-simon提議使用戶口做國際文宣活動或與海外單位聯絡&quot;&gt;陳梓華指Mark Simon提議使用戶口做國際文宣活動、或與海外單位聯絡&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳表示，他當時只是打算使用 LACOCK 戶口來做生意，不過 Mark Simon 建議「其實都可以用嚟做之前嘅社會運動，或者一啲國際嘅文宣活動」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又引述 Mark 指：「因為間公司係匿名，所以如果喺海外同唔同嘅單位聯絡嘅時候，或者可以用到呢間公司。」Mark 亦提及可以使用這間公司來做支援，例如在海外接洽時，需要轉帳金錢，「咁如果你唔想用自己名，咁就可以用間公司做。」不過陳向 Mark Simon 說，他無意如此使用該戶口。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（17日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第62日審訊。陳梓華繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供，他指黎智英有見「攬炒團隊發展得好好」，希望與「攬炒巴」劉祖廸見面，了解其想法。陳遂在2019年12月抵英會見劉，替黎轉話，並且應黎的建議會見「香港監察」創辦人羅傑斯（Benedict Rogers）。回到香港之後，陳與黎再次見面，陳引述黎當時稱：「佢唔係唔支持勇武，只係佢需要去迎合西方，去獲得國際支持，所以佢需要有咁樣嘅姿態，佢認為無可否認地，國際嘅支持比起勇武派嘅支持更加重要。」陳亦形容當時國際線「好亂」，有不同聲音，惟黎不同意年青人搶奪話語權，「佢認為應該用返老泛民嘅嗰種思想作為思想，同埋佢想團結國際線同埋攬炒派。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已認罪的被告陳梓華第四天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。由控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行作主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華李宇軒準備赴美見政要-尋求mark-simon協助&quot;&gt;陳梓華：李宇軒準備赴美見政要 尋求Mark Simon協助&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華供稱，李宇軒告訴他準備赴美國會見政要，但是李當時有憂慮，「佢擔心佢自己一個飛過去，最後一個人都見唔到」，而且李想見多一次美國議員 Rick Scott，所以問陳能否幫忙，「佢想我問吓 Mark Simon 嗰邊可唔可以幫到佢手」。陳又指，他和李均知道，香港民主委員會成員朱牧民與黎智英和 Mark Simon 的關係特別好，故此陳答應幫李問 Mark Simon。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳向 Mark Simon 轉達李需要協助，對方問李想在這次旅程達到什麼目標，還有什麼特別事需要幫手。陳引述李說，「佢想去見吓啲官員，去同佢哋講吓香港嘅情況，想做國際游說，同埋考慮將一個制裁名單，睇吓可唔可以交畀美國嘅官員，當時佢話因為唔想兩手空空咁去。」陳把李的說話轉告給 Mark Simon，「然後 Mark Simon 話，放心，佢會 arrange，要我同李宇軒講，唔會一個人都見唔到，同埋叫我鼓勵吓佢。」Mark 又指李至少會見到 Rick Scott。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，當時李並沒有傳送制裁名單給他看，而他在 Telegram 群組見過很多版本的制裁名單，後來旅程結束之後，他從李口中得悉，李用了「重光團隊」製作的「Profiles of Perpetrators of Human Rights and Democracy Abuse in Hong Kong（打壓香港人權和民主人士之檔案）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，他與 Mark Simon 通電之後，便向李轉達 Mark Simon 的說話，「放心，Mark Simon 話你唔會一個人都見唔到，同埋放心去 network 吓，加油。」因為建立人際網絡可以方便他將來做游說工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱李宇軒決定打國際線-持續分享其工作-陳將之轉告mark-simon&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱李宇軒決定「打國際線」 持續分享其工作 陳將之轉告Mark Simon&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳提到，李向他傳送了旅程照片，又告訴他已經將制裁名單交給美國議員。法官李運騰問，似乎李持續向陳匯報自己做過什麼。陳回應：「當時佢的而且確同我分享佢做過乜嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官接著問，李是純粹作為朋友向陳分享，還是李期望陳將他做過的事轉告給其他人。陳表示據他記憶，李當時決定「打國際線」，並會就不同事務與「攬炒巴」劉祖廸聯繫，「比較緊密」，陳說：「而我呢，就唔知道亦都冇參與佢哋國際線嘅游說，所以當時佢想話畀我聽，佢做過啲乜嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就李宇軒決定「打國際線」，陳稱他有把李的說話及做過的事告訴 Mark Simon，包括有一次李去日本，「佢（李）話佢自己展示咗啲催淚彈嘅彈頭。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指黎智英想會見攬炒巴了解想法-遂赴英國替黎轉話&quot;&gt;陳梓華指黎智英想會見「攬炒巴」了解想法 遂赴英國替黎轉話&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，他與黎智英於2019年11月在其座駕見面之後，黎曾經電話聯絡過他，「佢（黎）留意到，攬炒團隊發展得好好」，而黎知道陳聯絡不到勇武派領袖，「佢（黎）話我大概應該可以聯絡到喺國際線上面、文宣線上面比較出名嘅『攬炒巴』」，所以陳便嘗試聯絡「攬炒巴」劉祖廸。至於黎想見「攬炒巴」的原因，陳指黎「想見一見佢，了解一吓佢嘅諗法」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳稱，他於2019年12月赴英國與「攬炒巴」劉祖廸見面。陳將黎的想法告訴劉，包括「應該結合鐵三角嘅力量，同埋組成一個領袖團隊嘅諗法」，惟陳形容「劉祖廸有猶豫嘅」，「佢對於黎智英認為應該以和理非嘅手段作為抗爭主旨，有保留。」&lt;/p&gt;

▲ Finn Lau 劉祖廸（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳稱，當時他向劉說：「我認為你兩個可以直接對話，反正個會面唔會有人知道，而且所有嘅費用都會由黎智英負責，最後佢（劉）同意（會見黎智英）。」陳其後解釋「費用」是包括前往台北的機票和住宿費用，因為後來會面是在台北進行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華黎智英穿針引線下會見羅傑斯-對方提議將反修例問題放上國際法庭處理&quot;&gt;陳梓華：黎智英穿針引線下會見羅傑斯 對方提議將反修例問題放上國際法庭處理&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示黎智英與陳梓華之間的對話，在2019年12月20日，陳表示想盡用在英國的時間，問黎有沒有建議可以會見什麼人；黎則建議陳會見「香港監察」創辦人羅傑斯（Benedict Rogers）和英國議員 Lord Alton，並稱可以幫陳安排。陳認為「佢（黎）想我識多啲人，方便我將來參加國際游說嘅工作」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳最後在英國與羅傑斯見面，對方問起香港的情況，二人亦討論「會唔會有一啲途徑解決到香港人嘅矛盾、香港人同政府嘅矛盾」，對方提議：「可唔可以將個社會問題，例如反修例運動，放上去國際嘅法庭去解決，佢話佢相信最尾香港嘅問題都係要通過對話解決。」此外，羅傑斯亦有問陳能否講得出具體的事可以「要求外國人幫手」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，當羅傑斯問他接下來的行程、會見什麼人時，自己回答將會見劉祖廸，「當時我用『攬炒』呢個字，而佢（羅傑斯）聽得明呢個字」，並稱認識及見過劉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳提到，該次英國之旅的費用原本由他自行支付，但後來黎就英國和台北之行，一併過歸還相關款項給陳。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華黎智英否認不支持勇武-惟認為國際支持比勇武派支持更加重要&quot;&gt;陳梓華：黎智英否認不支持勇武 惟認為國際支持比勇武派支持更加重要&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳稱，他從英國回到香港之後，在2019年12月31日與黎智英再度會面，當時同樣在一架停泊在金鐘的座駕上單獨會面。陳將他會見劉祖廸的情況和對話告知黎，「基本上我就係話，黎智英對於勇武派嘅取態，似乎唔適合佢哋兩個見面。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳引述黎當時回應：「佢希望我明白，佢唔係唔支持勇武，只係佢需要去迎合西方，去獲得國際支持，所以佢需要有咁樣嘅姿態。佢認為無可否認地，國際嘅支持比起勇武派嘅支持更加重要。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱黎智英想主導國際線不同意年青人搶奪話語權&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱黎智英想主導國際線、不同意年青人搶奪話語權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;當控方追問「國際支持」是代表什麼，陳提到「當時呢國際線上係好亂嘅，有唔同嘅聲音」，有人提倡港獨，同時有人只想捍衛一國兩制，亦有人一直提倡制裁或封鎖香港，「佢（黎）認為年青人喺度搶緊個話語權」，即是年青人希望自己的聲音成為主流。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，黎智英不同意年青人搶奪話語權，「佢認為應該用返老泛民嘅嗰種思想作為思想，同埋佢想團結國際線同埋攬炒派。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問到黎智英為何認為應該採用泛民思想。陳指黎只是提及過西方不想見到什麼場面，但是沒有講到為何西方想見到香港採用泛民思想，然而「簡單啲嚟講，佢就係想主導成條國際線」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱黎智英於2019年11月已經談論民主派初選-稱本土派參與能增加認受性&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱黎智英於2019年11月已經談論民主派初選 稱本土派參與能增加認受性&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，黎希望他將上述說話內容，以及「初選嗰啲嘢話畀年青人知」。他指黎認為年青人應該多專注在選舉工作，「咁樣啲民氣先會集結到呀，同埋佢講話初選有啲好處。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，黎認為舉辦初選「可以集中到嗰啲黃絲嘅票源」，亦認為初選能夠吸納到參與過反修例運動的年輕人票源，提高投票率。黎曾指，如果素人參與初選的話，他們的票都可以「流返落老泛民度」，因為若果素人在初選中落敗，到正式立法會選舉的時候，其他勝出初選的候選人便可以得到這些素人的票源，「咁最尾泛民喺立法會嘅議席就可以鞏固到。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;初選案主審法官之一的李運騰問，陳的意思是否代表在2019年12月的時候，香港社會上已經開始討論初選。惟陳稱還未有相關討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官問，當陳在2019年12月31日跟黎見面，而黎談及初選時，陳是否知道黎在談論什麼。陳則表示他當時知道，其實早於2019年11月，他與黎在車上會面的時候，「佢（黎）話佢會支持本土派，如果啲素人參加初選，先會有認受性。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官追問，換言之陳是在2019年11月，從黎的口中首次聽到關於初選的事情。陳確認，並稱當時他理解「初選」是代表在泛民參選之前，他們會舉行初選。陳稱，他其後有在一些文宣和「公海」Telegram 群組中，向年青人轉達黎的說話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱有向李宇軒轉述黎智英說話-惟李對初選沒有興趣&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱有向李宇軒轉述黎智英說話 惟李對初選沒有興趣&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華稱，他在大約2020年1月初的時候，跟李宇軒轉述黎智英的說話，包括「佢（黎）會去見攬炒（劉祖廸）」及「喺國際線上面，黎智英唔想我哋咁搶咪⋯⋯啫係攞咗個話語權。」陳亦有向李轉述：「我哋喺國際線上面都係講番五大訴求」，然後談及黎對於初選的想法。李當時則回應「有排，啫係有一段長時間先到選舉」，所以理解他沒有興趣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於陳有否向黎智英提及李宇軒，陳則稱「好少，但係有」，例如他向黎談及眾籌，「我話統籌嗰個係佢（李），唔係我。」後來黎問起，李曾會見前政務司司長陳方安生和民主黨元老李柱銘，「佢（黎）問我，李宇軒其實係咪港獨派。我話我相信唔係。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，有一次他與黎講起聯合國，「佢（黎）問我點解唔去，因為當時明明其實應該我去（聯合國）講嘅，點解讓畀人哋。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱2020年1月到台灣陽明山別墅參與黎智英的飯局-同場有施明德&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱2020年1月到台灣陽明山別墅參與黎智英的飯局 同場有施明德&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，2020年1月10至12日，他到台灣打算觀摩總統大選，並在1月11日下午到達黎智英在陽明山的別墅參與一個飯局，同場有陳本人、黎智英、「攬炒巴」劉祖廸、一名姓林的女示威者、李永達夫婦、何俊仁夫婦和已故台灣民運人士施明德及其妻子。由於時間不足，陳同日晚上留在黎在台的住所觀看電視報導選舉結果，而未有外出觀選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;事前陳有告訴李，他將會去台灣觀摩大選，亦會去見黎智英，屆時他們可以做線上會議。陳又跟李說，他沒有特別問黎可不可以帶李宇軒一同出席飯局，不過李「覺得冇乜所謂，你哋兩個（陳梓華和劉祖廸）知道咪得囉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，在抵台的第三天，即1月12日，他連同劉祖廸和林姓示威者一起與施明德見面，然後晚上回到酒店，與劉祖廸和李宇軒進行線上會議，而正是在該次會議中，李和劉均決定「打國際線」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件周五（4月19日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（16日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第61日審訊。陳梓華繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供，2019年9月底，他向李宇軒轉達黎智英私人助理 Mark Simon 的邀請，希望他能一同會見訪港的美國議員 Rick Scott。陳並開設 WhatsApp 群組串連李宇軒和 Mark Simon 等人，商討會面安排。陳另私下以訊息向李轉達 Mark Simon 的提醒，籲李勿在美議員面前提起「攬炒團隊」或「港獨」，因為「攬炒團隊」形象激進，加上「有啲人會將香港獨立同攬炒個概念擺埋一齊」，而「冇任何政客會企出嚟幫港獨背書嘅，所以為免大家傾得唔愉快，所以就唔好提 JD team（攬炒團隊），或者唔好提嗰個 idea」。會面之後，陳指 Mark Simon 認為他和李宇軒「應該識多啲人」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已認罪的被告陳梓華第三天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。由控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行作主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指mark-simon提及民間游說工作邀海外官員來港觀察&quot;&gt;陳梓華指Mark Simon提及民間游說工作、邀海外官員來港觀察&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華昨日提到，在2019年8至9月的時候，黎智英的私人助手 Mark Simon 提議租用美國國會山莊的商務辦公室，舉辦關於香港的展覽和設游說中心。陳今補充，Mark Simon 當時說過：「點解當時 Jimmy 可以見到咁多官員，主要係因為畀錢嗰啲顧問公司。然後佢亦都提過可以做一啲民間游說嘅工作。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳問 Mark 兩者有什麼分別，Mark 則指：「如果你唔係以一個議員嘅身份，咁你就基本上係一個平民嘅身份同啲官員接觸呀，咁你可以講吓香港嘅情況，亦都可以邀請一啲海外嘅官員嚟香港睇一睇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指mark-simon-提議找李宇軒一同會見美議員&quot;&gt;陳梓華指Mark Simon 提議找李宇軒一同會見美議員&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就 Mark Simon 與另一名被告李宇軒於2019年9月底第一次見面，陳憶述事前 Mark Simon 告訴他將要會見美國議員斯科特（Rick Scott），並邀請他一同前來。「因為當時有啲突兀，我完全唔知 Rick Scott 係邊個」，在查問之下，Mark Simon 指斯科特是一名美國的議員，而他當時很想知道香港的狀況，所以 Mark Simon 想陳出席「講一講香港𠵱家嘅情況」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳表示，當時他計劃去台灣旅遊，所以向 Mark Simon 稱「我唔得閒」；對方便問陳有否想到其他適合人選。不久後 Mark Simon 問陳：「咁不如 Andy（李宇軒）？」陳指：「因為佢（Mark Simon）知道 Andy，啫係李宇軒，有眾籌經驗啦，佢亦都知道李宇軒曾經去過聯合國。」Mark Simon 則認為「如果佢（李）去到都好好」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，不過由於李並不屬於前線示威者，Mark Simon 建議最好找到其他曾經參與前線示威的年青人，故陳到其所屬的 Telegram 群組問，然後有一名叫「Cath」的人表示能夠出席會面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指政府不聆聽訴求警方不成比例的暴力-使示威者轉而尋求國際支援&quot;&gt;陳梓華指政府不聆聽訴求、警方不成比例的暴力 使示威者轉而尋求國際支援&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問 Mark Simon 口中的「香港情況」所指為何。陳則說：「因為香港當時經歷過7.21、8.31呢啲事件呢，成個氣氛喺反修例運動係好激進」，雖然「五大訴求」不是不重要，但是已經不是首要的訴求。由於當時「警方不平等、唔成比例嘅暴力，同埋政府完全唔聽市民嘅訴求」，所以當時尋求一種「令大家可以（與政府）平等 bargain 到，啫係開始要向國際政府、同埋議員呀尋求支援」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又追問「前線」是指什麼。陳說：「當時有一個普遍認知，前線示威者會走到去前線戴頭盔呀、遮呀，去同警方對峙；咁同埋比較常見嘅係佢哋會戴護目鏡啦、豬咀啦，呢一種形象或者佢哋參與呢種活動，通常就係被視為前線。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於為何「Cath」被視為「前線」，陳指因為在 Telegram 群組中，「Cath」會跟其他人說「今日去邊度發夢」，而「發夢」即是參與示威。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華向李宇軒轉達mark-simon的邀請-其後就會見美議員開設whatsapp群組&quot;&gt;陳梓華向李宇軒轉達Mark Simon的邀請 其後就會見美議員開設WhatsApp群組&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就與 Rick Scott 的會面，陳供稱他向李宇軒轉達：「我同話 Mark Simon 有個機會同Rick Scott 有一個 meeting 咁樣」，之後提到「佢（Mark Simon）就想話有啲年青人去同 Rick Scott 講吓香港情況」，而且對方是一名美國參議員，「Mark Simon 講過話，『將來想方便游說嘅話，呢個係一個好好嘅機會，你想唔想去？』」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳表示，因為想出席會面的人士自己商討安排，所以他開設了一個 WhatsApp 群組，然後把李宇軒加入去。控方在庭上展示群組資料，陳於2019年9月29日開設群組「Coffee on Sunday」，成員包括陳本人、李宇軒和 Mark Simon。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華在群組中表示稍後會加入另一名成員「Cath」，並介紹「Cath」是「前線」人士，李宇軒則是做國際文宣的人士。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指激進未必一定是年輕人-例如老人家也會支持年輕政黨很多勇武也是年紀大&quot;&gt;陳梓華指激進未必一定是年輕人 例如老人家也會支持年輕政黨、很多勇武也是年紀大&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到李宇軒是否被視為一名「年青人」，陳起初表示「當時我冇諗過添」，但之後稱：「我諗係呀⋯⋯我諗無論係 Mark Simon 定係 Jimmy（黎智英）呢，佢哋將當時成個反修例運動一啲唔係傳統泛民嘅支持者，佢哋就會覺得佢哋係後生嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭問及陳梓華的出生年份，陳回答1991年。法官李素蘭又問，陳是否比李宇軒年輕？陳回答：「係呀，我係91年，佢係90年，劉祖廸係92年。」陳又提到，黎智英和 Mark Simon 等人會覺得，「泛民其實一直就係比較溫和，而2019年反修例運動呢，就多咗好多勇武派啦。而呢種激進嘅思想，佢哋會覺得係年青人主導。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰則問陳是否同意這種歸類方式，因為激進的人未必一定是年輕人。陳表示：「正確，我一直都好反對呢啲標籤。有陣時我唔明點解前線嘅就係一定係前線，文宣就一定係文宣，而泛民就一定係老泛民。但係事實上我見到嘅係，都有唔少老人家都會支持好年輕嘅政黨，例如眾志，甚或乎有好多勇武都係年紀好大。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又提到：「有一次我同呀黎智英，喺佢屋企見面嘅時候，佢講過一句令我印象好深刻嘅說話：『黃藍是政見，但係黑白係良知。』」當時黎正在談論馬鞍山一名老人家被人點火燒傷的事件，陳引述黎稱：「『咁我哋應該點樣定義或標籤放火嘅人，同埋受傷嘅人呢？』」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指李宇軒去完聯合國後隆重其事周圍宣傳-為其最大賣點&quot;&gt;陳梓華指李宇軒去完聯合國後隆重其事、周圍宣傳 為其「最大賣點」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問陳為何在群組中介紹李宇軒為做國際文宣的人。陳表示，因為就當時 Stand with Hong Kong（重光團隊，簡稱 SWHK）而言，「佢（李）最令人印象深刻嘅，就係佢喺國際層面上嘅推廣，佢哋搞咗好多啲海外嘅集會呀、billboard 呀，咁所以我就會話佢（李）就係一個國際文宣嘅人。」陳續提及：「尤其係當時李宇軒去咗聯合國啦，有隆重其事，周圍同人講，周圍宣傳，所以我有咁樣嘅印象。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華亦在 WhatsApp 群組中建議李宇軒談及聯合國的經驗。陳庭上解釋，李當時去了聯合國的一個峰會，他私下向陳提及，原本計劃推動一個可以在聯合國大會處理的議案，「佢當時 explore 緊聯合國有冇一個機制或措施可以做到多啲香港嘅嘢，咁但係最尾得個桔，佢話打幾個卡、影吓相，冇乜意思。」陳指，「因為呢個係佢（李）當時本人嘅最大賣點」，否則李只能夠說他做過眾籌，而不能夠講到一些比較特別的東西。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華引述mark-simon籲勿提及攬炒團隊或港獨&quot;&gt;陳梓華引述Mark Simon籲勿提及「攬炒團隊」或港獨&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示陳梓華與李宇軒之間的 WhatsApp 對話，陳向李說：「Brother, Mark said do not mention about backer and JD team.」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指訊息中的「backer」是指墊支的人，即黎智英和 Mark Simon 在全球登報文宣行動中墊支。而「JD team」則是「攬炒團隊」，陳指 Mark Simon 曾告訴他：「因為唔想提任何關於港獨嘅嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰表示看不到「攬炒團隊」和「港獨」有任何關係，問陳梓華為何兩者有關係。陳回答：「因為 JD team 嘅取態係最激進嘅，思想上、國際層面上」，又提到「有啲人會將香港獨立同攬炒個概念擺埋一齊」。而陳認為：「啫係我諗一般都會明白，冇任何政客會企出嚟幫港獨背書嘅。所以為免大家傾得唔愉快，所以就唔好提 JD team，或者唔好提嗰個 idea。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳亦形容「攬炒團隊」在國際層面上是「思想上最激進」，「因為當時呢，攬炒團隊同埋攬炒巴（劉祖廸）係好出名嘅，佢（攬炒團隊）嘅形象就係激進」，雖然當時有其他零星組織提倡更加激進的思想，例如「香港建國」等，但是當時最標誌性的是「攬炒團隊」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指-mark-simon-認為他和李宇軒應該識多啲人&quot;&gt;陳梓華指 Mark Simon 認為他和李宇軒「應該識多啲人」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指李宇軒會見 Rick Scott 之後，曾向他表示：「原來呢個係 Mark Simon」，又指 Rick Scott「肯聽佢哋講囉」；不過陳沒有再問下去，而李之後亦沒有再詳述。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於 Mark Simon，陳引述他指「Rick Scott 好 impressed」，不過談論眾籌沒有用處，反而透過會面建立人際網絡更好。陳續指，「簡單啲嚟講，其實當時佢（Mark Simon）覺得我本人、李宇軒，應該識多啲人。」除此之外，二人便沒有再談論或跟進該次會面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（16日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第61日審訊。陳梓華繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供，他提及2019年11月到黎智英的住宅出席飯局，席間黎大力批評馬鞍山火燒人事件，陳引述黎當時說：「佢覺得勇武派冇組織、冇分寸，然後愈嚟愈濫用暴力，如果搞出咗人命嘅話，咁整個運動就會失去道德高地去對抗香港政府，從而亦都會失去國際嘅支持。」黎亦希望勇武派影響力愈少，運動能愈健康，因為「可以迎合番西方嘅期望」，包括在整場運動中「唔可以有警察死亡，亦都唔可以有示威嘅民眾死亡，同埋唔可以有無止境嘅暴力」。陳又稱，黎希望在區選之後建立一個橫跨勇武及和理非的「領導團隊」，陳曾嘗試向自稱勇武派人士轉達黎的主意，惟遭對方質疑：「黎智英？我特朗普添呀！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已認罪的被告陳梓華第三天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。由控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行作主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱黎智英想領導勇武派-冀以泛民或和理非作為主要抗爭手段&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱黎智英想領導勇武派 冀以泛民或和理非作為主要抗爭手段&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳早前供稱他與黎智英於2019年7月首次親身見面。至同年10月，黎智英致電陳，向陳提供了一個電話號碼，並叫陳可以用這個電話 WhatsApp 聯絡他。在10月18日，陳向黎發送訊息：「你好，黎前輩」，黎回覆很高興認識陳，日後可保持聯絡。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年11月12日，黎向陳傳送訊息，指一名男子在馬鞍山被黑衣人點火，使他感到害怕（dreaded），他認為勇武派應該有人領導，並提議在翌日的會面中詳細討論。據陳所理解，黎訊息的意思是「佢就係想領導或主導勇武派」。陳重提與黎的第一次會面，黎當時亦有談及「應該以以泛民或和理非的手段，作為當時主要嘅抗爭手段」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到為何黎特地向陳提及馬鞍山火燒人事後，陳相信「我諗佢（黎）都知我自己都唔鍾意呢種做法」，另一個原因是黎認為他可以聯絡到勇武派。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指2019年11月到黎智英住宅出席飯局-同場有林卓廷李永達和李卓人&quot;&gt;陳梓華指2019年11月到黎智英住宅出席飯局 同場有林卓廷、李永達和李卓人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就陳與黎的第二次親身會面，控方展示 WhatsApp 訊息，黎在會面前一日，即11月12日向陳交代司機接送的安排；陳問黎有否方法避開黎住所外的記者。陳庭上解釋，因為黎的私人助手 Mark Simon 曾提及過，「黎智英屋企出面係會有好多記者，基本上佢一舉一動都好可能會被報道。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/KB0q2HG.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
▲ 黎智英（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，他在11月13日如期到達黎的住宅出席飯局，同場還有民主黨的林卓廷和李永達，以及工黨的李卓人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指黎智英大力批評馬鞍山火燒人事件若搞出人命會使運動失道德高地&quot;&gt;陳梓華指黎智英大力批評馬鞍山火燒人事件、若搞出人命會使運動失道德高地&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳講述會面經過，經一輪介紹之後，黎智英開始就當時的反修例運動發表意見，「其中佢大力咁去批評馬鞍山放火燒人嗰件事，佢問我識唔識嗰個人，我話唔識。」然後林卓廷、李永達和李卓人都有發言，不過皆是附和黎的說話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳引述黎當時說：「佢覺得勇武派冇組織、冇分寸，然後愈嚟愈濫用暴力，如果搞出咗人命嘅話，咁整個運動就會失去道德高地去對抗香港政府，從而亦都會失去國際嘅支持。」之後黎說了一句：「黃藍係政見，黑白係良知。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，黎說「有啲嘅底線，佢需要堅守嘅」，所以再一次要求陳去聯絡勇武派領袖，希望說服他們去對話、要克制，又重申應該以「和理非」作為主旨或抗爭手段。陳指，「今次就更加清晰喇，佢就想我將頭先講嘅呢一個訊息去傳遞畀其他年輕人。」陳當時回覆：「嘗試吓。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指黎智英稱泛民有足夠本土資源和割𥱊地位去爭取政府回應訴求&quot;&gt;陳梓華指黎智英稱泛民有足夠本土資源和割𥱊地位去爭取政府回應訴求&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳另引述黎：「佢話如果年青人做唔到嘅嘢，佢可以以傳媒嘅力量做到」，而且飯局上有三名泛民領袖，「佢（黎）認為泛民都擁有足夠嘅本土資源，同埋割𥱊地位，去爭取到政府嘅回應」，即是爭取政府落實雙普選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「傳媒力量」的意思，陳指黎並未有仔細講，「但就係話《蘋果日報》唔係要報道啲勇武，只要唔報道佢哋，佢哋嘅影響力已經會細咗好多。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華黎智英想證明國際力量很重要美國沒有離棄香港&quot;&gt;陳梓華：黎智英想證明國際力量很重要、美國沒有離棄香港&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年11月15日，黎傳送香港民主委員會（Hong Kong Democracy Council）的 Twitter 截圖給陳，當中提及《香港人權與民主法案》。黎又表示，美國議會即將表決，沒有理由不通過法案，形容這是一個非常棒的消息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，黎為何會傳送這些訊息給陳。陳稱他認為黎是「想證明國際嘅力量係好重要，同埋美國並沒有離棄或者係唔理香港發生緊咩事」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訊息紀錄顯示黎智英向陳梓華查問中大黑衣人身份交流勇武派資訊&quot;&gt;訊息紀錄顯示黎智英向陳梓華查問中大黑衣人身份、交流勇武派資訊&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年11月16日，黎智英向陳轉發一則中大校友通訊，當中提及「各類車的司機已經是黑衣人，不是中大職員」、「校內情況惡劣，建築物被破壞，飯堂關門，住在宿舍的師生缺糧」等。黎問陳：「Wetland (Wayland)，你知道這些黑衣人到底是謝（誰）人嗎？謝謝。」陳回覆：「不同組別人士，由屠龍及 Black Boc 等隊伍為首，形成的一幫沒有紀律人士」、「他們希望霸佔中大作據點。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳庭上表示，在黎問他之前，他已經問過其他人了解中大情況，「因為個畫面好誇張」，網上討論區有人聲稱「啲嘢全部打爛晒，連嗰啲工程車都塗晒鴉」，所以他想知道是否真有其事。而陳經了解後，所得的資訊就是他回覆黎的內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Yq5P46G.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同年11月17日，陳向黎傳送訊息，叫黎特別留意數隊勇武小隊，包括「屠龍、中移動、閃燈、蜘蛛、V小隊、毒蛇、粉紅、Pink Team」，指他們帶領著不能接受的暴力升級，而《蘋果》曾訪問其中三隊，以及其中一隊的領袖「Max」，他正在理大衝突中領導防守。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳庭上解釋，由於黎一直希望聯絡到勇武小隊，但陳本人無法聯絡，而傳媒很早已經訪問過他們，因此叫黎留意訊息提及的幾隊勇武小隊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英和陳梓華討論警方團封理大是否陰謀-黎稱希望勇武精銳份子能逃脫&quot;&gt;黎智英和陳梓華討論警方團封理大是否陰謀 黎稱希望勇武精銳份子能逃脫&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年11月19日，黎與陳討論警方團封理大事件是否「警方的陰謀」、「這局面其實很易設計」、「理工在城市，警方封了路就無法逃脫」，又指警方「把我最精銳的人一網打盡，希望昨天逃出來的都是勇武精銳份子」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳解釋，當時大家一路都是透過網上資訊去了解理大的情況，「當時我覺得成件事好古怪，你點會走入去一個走唔到嘅地方做示威，咁我諗係咪一個陰謀」，然後黎發表他的個人意見，「但我又喺一啲 Telegram group 度睇到好犀利、令人印象深刻嘅評論，就講緊會唔會係一個『圍點打援』。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rlUMrXC.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指黎智英盡量迎合西方要求-包括不能有警察或示威者死亡暴力不能無止境&quot;&gt;陳梓華指黎智英盡量迎合西方要求 包括不能有警察或示威者死亡、暴力不能無止境&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問為何黎如此關心勇武派，陳表示：「我認為佢（黎）當時希望勇武影響力愈小，就對整個運動愈健康」，「少咗好多暴力嘅畫面，同埋可以迎合番西方嘅期望？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又表示，他當時並未知道「迎合西方」這回事，「係去到後來，佢有話畀我知，究竟美國政府內部係點樣諗，我先明白，黎智英一直以嚟，並唔係純粹咁想去爭取國際嘅支持，而係佢已經知道某啲嘅需求，然後盡量去滿足呢啲要求。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問黎想滿足什麼「要求」。陳指整個運動中，「唔可以有警察死亡，亦都唔可以有示威嘅民眾死亡，同埋唔可以有無止境嘅暴力。」陳指黎在2020年3至4月的訊息中談及美國內部消息，「人哋個立場，係覺得好多民間嘅訴求或者指控，對於個政府，未必有證據，大概係咁嘅意思。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指黎智英希望區選前勇武派暫停暴力抗爭-遂應黎要求籲勿生事&quot;&gt;陳梓華指黎智英希望區選前勇武派暫停暴力抗爭 遂應黎要求籲勿生事&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年11月20日，黎告知陳，美國參議院一致通過支持香港示威者的措施（Senate Unanimously Approves Measures Backing Hong Kong Protesters）；陳當時回覆已經得悉相關消息，希望該措施能向政府施壓。惟陳庭上表示不肯定該「措施」是指什麼，「我諗佢（黎）係想話畀我知美國做緊嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在2019年區選之前，陳向黎提及「聽說小樺被捕了」，又稱：「我已經呼籲大家24日前別生事。」陳庭上解釋，他當時是應黎的要求向其他人轉達黎的呼籲，「佢希望喺區議會選舉之前，尤其是當日，勇武派唔好暴力抗爭住。佢當時認為應該將焦點集中喺區議會選舉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指黎智英希望成立橫跨勇武和理非的領導團隊&quot;&gt;陳梓華指黎智英希望成立橫跨勇武、和理非的「領導團隊」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後黎向陳傳送訊息，表示有需要認真考慮成立一個領導團隊，應該在區選之後討論（“It’s time to seriously think about a leadership group. After the election we should talk.”），陳庭上表示以他理解，黎想建立一個「橫跨勇武、和理非」的「大台」，而黎希望陳能夠在這個領導團隊入面，並叫他尋找同路人一起商量。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;後來區議會選舉結果出爐，非建制派奪下近400席，黎向陳表示：「贏到咁，世估唔到！香港人民力量大翻身！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱嘗試向自稱勇武派轉達黎智英想建立大台-惟遭對方質疑身份&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱嘗試向自稱勇武派轉達黎智英想建立「大台」 惟遭對方質疑身份&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於第三次見面，陳供稱在2019年11月27日，黎智英相約他到金鐘法院道，其座駕停泊在一處，當時黎的私人司機離開車廂並收起陳的電話，然後二人單獨在座駕傾談。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳憶述他首先重申「真係聯絡唔到勇武派嘅領袖」，因為先前提及過的困難，加上當時經歷了中大和理大的衝突之後，當陳嘗試跟自稱認識勇武派的人士在 Telegram 群組傾談的時候，「佢哋當時覺得呢件事好衰，當時有一句『打就係佢哋打』，可能喺前線嘅係佢哋，『畀人拉嘅係佢哋，然後你就想有一個大台』，咁我當時話『唔係，唔係我』，我話呢個係黎智英嘅諗法，然後佢就話：『黎智英？我特朗普添呀！』」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，是否代表對方表達一種不信任，即是不相信陳是跟據黎而行事。陳確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，他向黎智英表達正正是因為該些困難而聯絡不到勇武派，不過黎說「唔緊要」，因為「佢大致掌握勇武派嘅資料同動向」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指黎智英認為應結合議會街頭和國際力量延續反修例熱情-從而推爆個政府&quot;&gt;陳梓華指黎智英認為應結合議會、街頭和國際力量延續反修例熱情 從而「推爆個政府」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，黎提到他當時會見了張崑陽，「佢（黎）對佢（張）評價好高。」據陳所理解，二人見面是要商討贊助網上電台事宜，但是張並不需要黎的贊助，而是靠眾籌已經處理得到。然後黎開始說：「眾籌真係好似好過佢一個人嘅贊助，因為眾籌啫係代表嗰件事有認受性」，即使眾籌未能達標，「都可以研究吓可唔可以吱啲錢落去，令到個眾籌可以達標。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指黎繼而談及區議會選舉大勝，「佢（黎）覺得嚟緊應該結合議會嘅力量、街頭嘅力量，同國際嘅力量，先可以延續呢個反修例運動嘅熱情，同埋推爆個政府，push it to the edge，去逼迫個政府去回應市民訴求。」&lt;/p&gt;

Multiple stakeholders have the opportunity to address labor market challenges by expanding and creating workforce development initiatives.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Northern Triangle of Central America (NTCA) — composed of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras — holds promise as a potential nearshoring hub for U.S. companies with facilities far abroad. With a predominantly youthful population, close proximity to the United States, and emerging sectors such as textiles, agribusiness, manufacturing, and business process outsourcing (BPO), these countries have the potential to achieve higher levels of development similar to Costa Rica or Panama if they can attract significant domestic and foreign direct investment (FDI) and develop their workforces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investing in human capital — that is, people’s knowledge, skills, and qualifications — and attracting companies into the region are long-term strategies worth pursuing. Since 2019, over 2 million people, particularly youth, have emigrated from the NTCA in search of opportunities elsewhere, mainly in the United States. Attracting new companies and investing in workforce development initiatives could help stabilize the region by providing people with jobs, income, and future opportunities for training and career growth. The U.S. government and the private sector have signaled commitment to increasing investment in the region through the Partnership for Central America and the White House’s Call to Action in the NTCA. Workforce development is not an easy or quick fix and must be a long-term interest for U.S. companies and development agencies as they engage in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-untapped-potential-of-economic-sectors-in-the-ntca&quot;&gt;The Untapped Potential of Economic Sectors in the NTCA&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many economic development opportunities that would help NTCA countries increase formal employment and promote cross-sectoral linkages, thus creating compounding economic growth in the region. Among the most promising sectors with high growth potential are agribusiness, textiles, and manufacturing (e.g., in auto parts and electric components), as well as services such as BPO and tourism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business Process Outsourcing:&lt;/strong&gt; BPO refers to services such as accounting, information technology (IT), call centers, payment platforms, and others that larger companies can outsource. About 48,000 Guatemalans, 80 percent of whom are bilingual, are employed by the customer service outsourcing and other BPO services. El Salvador hosts more than 70 call centers and BPO operations, employing 26,000 people, while Honduras has 47 call centers that employ more than 17,000 people. According to a report by the International Finance Corporation titled Digital Entrepreneurship and Innovation in Central America, BPO and financial services firms tend to be the first adopters of technology, including cloud computing, real-time market information tools, cybersecurity technologies, and e-commerce platforms. The report also showed that technology-using firms tend to grow the fastest. To capitalize on these sectors, workers need to be equipped with specific skills, including language competencies, digital literacy, and other “soft” skills such as customer service and good communication.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Textiles:&lt;/strong&gt; The textile and garment sector generates 270,000 direct and indirect jobs in El Salvador, 180,000 in Guatemala, and 105,000 in Honduras. Companies such as Fruit of the Loom, SanMar, Elcatex, Parkdale Mills, and Crowley have established operations in the NTCA and have taken advantage of incentives from the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) with the United States, which took effect in 2006. For example, yarn used to produce garments is covered under CAFTA-DR, and the cotton used is of U.S. origin. President and CEO of the National Council of Textile Organizations, Kim Glas, announced in February 2023 that apparel imports, many containing U.S. textile inputs, had increased 24 percent in the past year. Moreover, the Covid-19 pandemic provided additional incentive for U.S. companies to nearshore U.S. textile trade with China to NTCA countries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agribusiness:&lt;/strong&gt; A quarter of the population in the Northern Triangle works in the agricultural sector. Honduras has a variety of microclimates that allow for a diversification of production, and nearly 70 percent of Guatemala’s territory is used for agricultural purposes. All countries in the region enjoy duty-free access for the entry of fresh fruits and vegetables to different markets due to various free trade agreements, including DR-CAFTA. Smallholder farmers in the Northern Triangle account for about 50 percent of agriculture exports, including commodities such as coffee, sugar, bananas, and other tropical fruits. Although there is a lot of potential within this sector, these countries still rely on products with little value added.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manufacturing:&lt;/strong&gt; In 1965, Mexico’s maquiladora policy was adopted by the Northern Triangle countries. The policy, which enables producers and investors “tax-free importation of raw materials and intermediate inputs which they process and/or assemble and then reexport, again tax-free, to the United States,” paved the way for more FDI in the region and regional trade agreements such as NAFTA and CAFTA-DR. According to 2022 survey data from the International Labour Organization (ILO), manufacturing, as defined by the International Standard Industrial Classification, accounts for 13.7 percent of total employment in both Guatemala and Honduras and 14.5 percent in El Salvador.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies in these sectors need to continue to hire qualified workers that possess a variety of skills. For example, to conduct BPO services, employees need to master languages, in this case both English and Spanish, and need to know how to use information and communications technology (ICT) equipment. Similarly, to be able to operate specific machinery and technology, workers need to possess technical skills and different levels of digital literacy. To conduct more sophisticated engineering projects or work in advanced technical trades, workers need training in science, technology, engineering, and medicine (STEM) fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of these skills, competencies, and knowledge can be imparted at schools, universities, and training institutions, while others can be learned with practice, working on the job. However, proxy studies suggest that citizens from these countries are not likely to be proficient in English and would benefit from higher levels of education achievement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies that operate in these countries find it hard to hire and retain qualified workers. While the chronic underdevelopment of human capital is preventing many economic sectors from growing, this challenge is not insurmountable. Development institutions, the U.S. government, private companies, and governments in the Northen Triangle have the aligned interest of wanting to see a thriving, self-sufficient market-based economy simultaneously fueled by and contributing to a highly skilled workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;labor-market-challenges-in-the-ntca&quot;&gt;Labor Market Challenges in the NTCA&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weak human capital is a barrier for firms operating in the region. According to the World Bank’s Human Capital Index, which examines a combination of education, health, and employment metrics to assess human capital levels in a country, all three NTCA countries score slightly below the 56 percent average for Latin America and the Caribbean. Guatemala’s Human Capital Index score is 0.46, which means that the average child born in 2020 is estimated to be 46 percent as productive when they grow up compared to if the child enjoyed a complete education and full healthcare. Honduras and El Salvador score 48 percent and 55 percent, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, results from the 2016 World Bank Enterprise Survey show that private firms in Honduras recognize human capital as a significant hurdle. In particular, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) face challenges such as lack of entrepreneurship training and skill development programs, burdensome labor regulations, and financial illiteracy. In Guatemala, SMEs perceive that they are unable to attract talent because they cannot compete with the pay scales of larger companies. At the same time, companies that offer quality technical training often find that individuals have such low levels of primary education that the technical education is too advanced for their mastery of the material. A worker’s inability to absorb technical training due to a low-quality or nonexistent education stifles many career prospects. The private sector is unable to further train workers for in-demand jobs if there is a failure to achieve basic educational standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both access to education and the quality of schooling are major challenges in the NTCA. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (OECD) Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) for 2022, students in Guatemala and El Salvador achieved mean mathematics scores of 344 and 343, respectively, well below the OECD average of 472. The 2022 PISA assessment for reading and math shows that El Salvador and Guatemala rank at the bottom of the list. In countries with such low performance, many students drop out and find informal jobs. For example, much of Guatemala’s youth and adolescent populations do not reach high school, with 45.8 percent of secondary education students (typically considered ages 12–17) not enrolled in or attending school. A high dropout rate for high school suggests that education is perceived to have little utility for gaining future employment. In NTCA countries, early school dropout rates are, on average, 22 percent higher than in the rest of the Latin American and Caribbean region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To complicate matters, students who do not complete high school are more likely to find low-quality employment. Reinforcing this trend is a high correlation between educational attainment and employment in the formal sector. In Guatemala and Honduras, studies have found that workers who only reach lower secondary education are more likely to get jobs in the informal economy than workers with greater levels of education. Furthermore, unemployment and underemployment are common among younger age groups, and many young people remain idle, meaning they are not searching for education, training, or employment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond human capital deficiencies, the region’s business environment scores very poorly and has not been able to attract significant FDI. Stringent labor market laws are a disservice for both workers and companies trying to recruit talent. Labor markets in all three NTCA countries are characterized by high levels of informality, a feature that can be attributed in part to overbearing labor regulations. For example, in Honduras, there is strong evidence to suggest that economic actors in the county bypass the constraints of the regulatory environment by maintaining few full-time employees, hiring a higher proportion of temporary workers, or avoiding formalization entirely. Data from the 2016 World Bank Enterprise Survey show that 72.5 percent of Honduran firms compete directly against unregistered or informal firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current labor laws preventing flexibility in the workplace needlessly add opportunity costs for workers, especially for young professionals and women. “Ordinary” working hours add rigidity to the labor market, as they limit the amount of work that must be completed during a certain window of the day. For example, in Honduras, standard working hours cannot exceed 44 hours per week and must be completed between 5:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. This creates scheduling challenges for students that may need to attend classes during the day, or for parents wanting to work while their children are in school during the day and after they go to bed at night. Night work, a separate classification of labor, is performed between 7:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m. and cannot exceed 36 hours per week. Guatemala has the same maximum of 44 hours per week for daytime workers but classifies a daytime worker using a smaller window of work occurring between 6:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. Such outdated labor laws remove the flexibility enjoyed by remote workers elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, working on a part-time basis or seasonally is not always allowed in the region. Guatemala did not ratify the ILO’s Part-Time Work Convention until 2017, only to have its constitutional court later suspend the framework. The Honduran congress created the National Hourly Employment Program in 2010, which allowed hourly contracts, but the program has since been met with resistance by labor unions, the Honduran Association of Labor Lawyers (AALH), and political opposition. Currently, only indefinite-term contracts, fixed-term contracts, and project contracts are permissible in Honduras and Guatemala. In an attempt to protect workers, these regulations are eliminating options for workers that would make education, skilling, and training outside of work more feasible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;improving-education-and-easing-labor-market-barriers&quot;&gt;Improving Education and Easing Labor Market Barriers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These challenges should not deter action or investment. The U.S. government and the private sector have an opportunity to work together to eliminate impediments and energize the labor market. There are three areas that require policy intervention to improve labor market outcomes in the region: (1) improving the business environment, including worker flexibility, (2) enhancing the quality of work and addressing informality, and (3) supporting educational institutions and workforce development initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Improve the business environment.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Rather than pursuing piecemeal reforms for particular sectors, countries in the region should take a less prescriptive approach by prioritizing legislative reforms that would benefit any sector of the economy. The World Justice Program’s 2023 Rule of Law Index, which includes 142 countries, ranks El Salvador 108th, Guatemala 111th, and Honduras Above regulatory reforms for specific sectors, NTCA countries should prioritize building better business environments.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The private sector demands predictable government regulation to allow for more flexible hiring. Hourly wages and other business-friendly adjustments to labor law in the region would allow the workforce to expand in high seasons or work during peak hours only. Requiring all employees to be salaried restrains employers and employees from achieving the most mutually beneficial transactions. Not only would these measures entice prospective companies to invest in the region, but they would also help existing companies and workforce programs scale in size and impact.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Improve working conditions and address informality.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Second, there is also a need to improve the quality of the jobs and working conditions in the region. Studies show that people employed in the formal economy earn 19 percent more than those in the informal sector. In addition to job-matching programs and workforce training, private sector leaders can support formalization in their own supply chains, and governments in the region can lower administrative costs and help informal business navigate requirements for formalization. Likewise, local governments can incentivize corporate social responsibility through tax exemptions and other benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Increased digitization is an opportunity to promote formalization, delivery of services, and transparency in the enforcement of contracts. Digitization would help small informal businesses, including in the agricultural sector, to register and conduct operations beyond immediate markets through e-commerce. In addition to expanding market size, digitizing informal businesses can also improve access to credit and risk assessments. This is an important pillar of U.S. vice president Kamala Harris’s Call to Action to remove barriers to private sector investment in the Northern Triangle. El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras ranked 107th, 114th, and 180th, respectively, out of 193 countries in the United Nation’s 2022 E-Government Development Index, an assessment of country-level digital government landscapes. Moreover, the digitization of customs processes would save time and costs, encouraging further investment. Converting bureaucratic processes such as land and business registration to paperless interfaces would also help in the fight against corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Support educational institutions and workforce development initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Finally, better education and workforce development efforts should be a high priority. Not all of these programs have to be led by large multinational companies. Supporting local businesses with a high potential to create employment is another avenue to enable private sector growth and job creation. Moreover, development agencies that have a significant footprint in the region, including the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Inter-American Development Bank, can be force multipliers for companies and governments in the region by absorbing some risk and providing capital. The United States has recognized the strategic significance and economic potential of the region and intends to support efforts to make technical training programs more relevant to employers’ needs. Training programs, boot camps, and other workforce initiatives have been implemented in the region to redeem the situation and provide better opportunities for workers. These initiatives can be replicated and scaled in other sectors (see Box 1 for a list of some of these initiatives).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Collaboration among government entities and the private sector has led to the design and implementation of low-cost, high-reward training programs, helping to guarantee job formalization. For example, Advance, funded by USAID, is a workforce development program in Guatemala and Honduras (as well as the Dominican Republic and Jamaica) that brings together stakeholders from the educational and private sectors to identify priority economic sectors and strengthen technical education to meet labor market needs.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Technical and vocational education and training (TVET) programs overseen by employers can also help guarantee that workers are equipped with the right sets of skills required to succeed in their field. Companies can provide technical expertise in curriculum development so that students are motivated to complete school knowing they will have the tools to succeed in the labor market. In addition, technology is shaping the labor market and redefining what skills are in demand. Ensuring TVET programs remain relevant amid technological changes requires continual curriculum development.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;However, those who would benefit from programs may not be aware of the opportunity. Local governments and schools should coordinate with those offering workforce development programs to advertise the availability of existing programs, whether through social service professionals or social media campaigns. Low enrollment in existing quality workforce development offerings is a missed opportunity for all parties. Raising awareness of current initiatives could spur further investment and boost enrollment.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In addition, investing in bilingual education can reap significant benefits to build the region’s human capital. In Honduras, bilingual education used to be offered only in private institutions, but the Honduran government has recognized the value of bilingual education and is pushing for the country to be more attractive for bilingual companies. The Honduran minister of education is committed to opening bilingual teaching training centers in pursuit of his vision to have Honduras be a bilingual nation by 2032. A World Bank study found that bilingual students in Guatemala had higher attendance rates, lower dropout rates, and received higher scores on all subject matters. The incentives for school systems to equip students with language skills are clear.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;promising-workforce-models&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Promising Workforce Models&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Domestic private sector leaders have partnered with higher education institutions to ensure that training is equipping students with the skills and knowledge needed to excel in the workplace. Below are several examples of promising models:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Textiles: No formal textile training exists in the region despite industry demand for tens of thousands of workers. Think HUGE, a job creation business council for the region, has partnered with Universidad Tecnológica Centroamericana (UNITEC) in Honduras and the Wilson College of Textiles at North Carolina State University to establish an educational network for the textile industry. The agreement outlines plans for developing professional training courses, certificate programs, degrees, and funding for scholarships, fellowships, and internships.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Electric Components: Yazaki North America announced a pilot-project factory in Guatemala in January 2022, becoming Guatemala’s first automotive parts manufacturer. The company also already operates in El Salvador. Yazaki chose to expand nearshoring efforts after experiencing supply chain difficulties during the Covid-19 pandemic. Another reason Guatemala was attractive for Yazaki was the commitment of El Instituto Técnico de Capacitación y Productividad (INTECAP), a leading Guatemalan organization with the mission of promoting employability and technical development, to create training programs specifically for Yazaki. Dozens of Guatemalan workers have already completed courses on topics ranging from industrial Ethernet and Profibus networks to mechanical and electrical measurements. Yazaki collaborated with USAID and the Guatemalan Ministry of Economy in making the investment.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Value Chains: The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) approved a project in 2021 aimed at strengthening regional value chains in the Northern Triangle. It aims to foster talent development in the three countries by providing finishing school programs to equip workers with English and IT certifications. These skills will be highly valuable for success in the BPO sector, as well as the enhancement of regional and global integration in value chains.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Moreover, Alterna, in partnership with USAID, supports small and growing businesses by providing business and technical services. As of March 2024, 85 businesses had completed Alterna’s cultivation processes to improve business-market intelligence, gain strategic-financial knowledge, hone digital and soft skills, and access value chain connections and financing opportunities.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Software: The Kodigo Academy for Creative Technology and the IDB Laboratory, the innovation laboratory of the IDB, invested $1.5 million into launching a software training program. The program aims to train 1,500 people by offering courses in various branches of the growing digital sector. In an era where many existing jobs are under threat of being replaced by artificial intelligence and automation, it is important to develop skills that will remain relevant as technology advances.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. companies looking to outsource production closer to home are usually turning to Canada and Mexico as their first choices for relocation. They should also consider NTCA countries as potential nearshoring locations. U.S. companies hesitating to invest or expand in the region due to workforce challenges can be a part of the solution, working in tandem with development organizations and international supporters to reduce security risks, energy costs, infrastructure insufficiencies, and corruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the prerequisites to invest or expand operations in the NTCA is a skilled workforce. Governments, private actors, and donors must work in coordination to reduce barriers for investment while creating and expanding workforce development initiatives. A comprehensive approach is necessary, one that combines the private sector’s expertise and the international community’s access to finance with the public sector’s ability to build inviting regulatory environments and infrastructure. The U.S. government, other international partners, and multilateral development banks should champion the needed policy changes and use their funding of workforce development programs to get commitment from governments in the NTCA to pursue pro-business reforms. By supporting the stated ambitions of all Northern Triangle governments through the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity, the U.S. government is investing in increasing the availability of meaningful economic opportunities for citizens in the NTCA. Building a shared vision and investing in proven programs can help the region stem the outflow of people, further stabilize, and unlock its full economic potential.&lt;/p&gt;

It postulates three challenges that increasing battlefield transparency and ubiquitous long-range precision fires pose to logistics:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Logistics must enter the theatre of operations where infrastructure is concentrated, and so key sustainment nodes can be struck throughout operational depth.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because supply is projected from known points of origin, it is susceptible to pattern-of-life analysis, enabling highly disruptive targeting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once forces are fixed in combat, the limited number of ground lines of communication to their positions makes them systemically vulnerable to isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two processes involved in tactical sustainment: the flow of materiel forwards to resupply units; and the recovery of equipment and casualties rearwards. The principles driving tactical adaptation to ensure survivability of these functions are well established and well tested – dispersal, deception and convoys. Technology is transforming how these principles can be applied. For resupply, three technologies and approaches are critical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The dispersion of caches throughout the rear support area can now be managed through digitised command and control (C2) and planning support tools to avoid concentrating supplies in logistics hubs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The use of containers and mixed loads can create a uniformity and thus ambiguity to sustainment components that minimises the ability of the adversary to target the logistics structure efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The deliberate support to logistics elements from combat arms during last mile resupply to open windows for safe passage can enable safe delivery to the front. Given the constraints on how often this can be accomplished, it requires the accurate predictive push of materiel to be efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medical support is especially vulnerable. This is because of the electromagnetic signature of medical posts, combined with the decline in adherence to international humanitarian law as regards the protected status of hospitals. It is therefore necessary for medical support to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maximise the mobility of Role 2 hospitals by mounting their constituent parts on vehicles and maintaining modular capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adapt tactics, techniques and procedures to enable surgery with intermittent relocation, to enable medical posts to continue to function in the indirect fire zone, ensuring damage-control resuscitation can be delivered within 60 minutes of injury.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Equipping and crewing Role 1 facilities to maximise the precision of triage to avoid saturating surgical capacity, bypass Role 2 for those who can be safely evacuated further to the rear on a longer timeline, and offer palliative care to those who cannot be saved.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ensure that medical support has resilient C2 that can fully exploit the data necessary to coordinate dispersed operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data is similarly critical to ensuring the survivability of repair and maintenance support:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The use of digital twins to conduct predictive maintenance on complex systems is a key tool for maximising the efficiency of forwards to support dispersed platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For sophisticated components, platform modularity is critical in enabling sensors and other payloads to be swapped out, so that broken components can be repaired in the rear. For simple parts, additive manufacture can be used to minimise the number of unique spares that must be held at the rear of units and brought forwards.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the repair sites themselves, deception is an increasingly important tool for improving survivability, as concealment is increasingly difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collectively, these measures can make a supply system robust, even under extensive surveillance. However, a sustainment system working in this way will still impose constraints on combat arms. It is therefore essential that the combat arms adjust their planning assumptions as regards tempo, the sustainable size of force packages, and the force protection they must offer to their service support arms if they are to sustain the fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cliché that while amateurs talk tactics, professionals talk logistics may be how militaries ought to function, but it is not reflective of peacetime practice. There is relatively little attention given to sustainment in either the British Army’s “Future Soldier” or the US Army’s “U.S. Army in Multi-Domain Operations”. As the Russian invasion of Ukraine has demonstrated, logistics appear to have played a limited role in the Kremlin’s professional planning, showing that the gap between policy aspirations and capability is far from being a uniquely Western conceptual oversight. Nevertheless, throughout history, logistics and sustainment have dictated the size of armies that can be fielded, their tempo, lethality, endurance and resilience. Furthermore, the threats that are reshaping tactics for combat arms units similarly create serious challenges for combat service support (CSS) elements. This paper seeks, therefore, to outline both the threats to CSS and how these risks can be mitigated through tactical and capability development. The questions the paper hopes to provoke – although not answer here – is how changes in sustainment operations must necessarily shape planning assumptions for the combat arms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sustainment is a broad doctrinal term encompassing logistics, medical support, engineering support, pay and personnel services, and maintenance. This paper concerns logistics and medical support forward of the corps: those functions that keep fighting formations able to operate, and which require regular transfers of materiel and personnel forwards and rearwards. The questions of theatre and operational sustainment at corps and above are beyond the scope of this paper, partly because they are largely a question of integrated air and missile defence and cyber defence, which are not solely relevant to sustainment. Nor is this paper concerned with tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) for tactical resupply by support companies inside fighting battalions, as this subject is specific to the particular sub-units being supported. The paper focuses on the divisional support area, protection of its functions, and the forward and rearward flow of materiel by close support sustainment units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper is divided into four chapters. Chapter I outlines the threats to CSS elements, examining how the changing operating environment poses specific tactical problems for CSS. Chapter II examines how tactical and capability adaptation may solve some of these challenges for resupply of formations, focusing on the movement of materiel forwards in a largely proactively planned manner. Chapters III and IV examine how militaries may mitigate threats to sustainment activities that rely on rearward movement, largely imposed by the adversary: medical and maintenance support. The conclusion considers the impact of these considerations on combat arms, indicating areas for further study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has a broad evidence base. The assessment of threat systems is derived from: observation of deep strike capabilities and their kill chains employed during the Russian invasion of Ukraine; practical experimentation with a range of sensor systems and the associated signatures of CSS elements on exercises across NATO; and a review of literature on threat systems, mainly related to the impact on combat arms. The baseline for the potential threat is drawn from core planning assumptions for the sustainment footprint of existing formations. With regard to mitigations, the aim is to identify what a CSS footprint must look like to be survivable given the constraints of the task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper’s conclusions are largely based on practical observation of sustainment operations, mapping timing and footprint, and interviews with CSS practitioners worldwide over several years. Interviews have also been conducted with dozens of figures in the field of medical sustainment, both individually and at conferences, workshops and exercises. Conclusions are also based on the bitter experience of one of the authors of observing the complications that arose around the sustainment of Ukraine’s armed forces, and the innovative solutions that were found. One of the authors is a senior practitioner, who draws on extensive experience from operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper’s methodology is, therefore, essentially an iterative mapping of dependencies. It is important to note that beyond theatre sustainment, military combat service support is, as B A Friedman observed, more of an art than a science. There are numerical inputs that generate the boundaries of possibility but, unlike in a civilian logistics system, the active attempt by an adversary to disrupt processes creates risk in the pursuit of efficiency. For this reason, the authors have sought to focus on the risk calculus that commanders will face, and the constraints the threat will place on their freedom of action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-the-emerging-threat-landscape&quot;&gt;I. The Emerging Threat Landscape&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June 2022 it would have been reasonable to assert that the Ukrainian military was being defeated. The enemy had amassed a 10:1 advantage in artillery, was achieving blanket saturation of the electromagnetic spectrum, and had shaped the battlefield to fix Ukrainian forces in killing areas. They were suffering an unsustainable attrition rate, while unable either to find Russian targets or to bring their guns in range to disrupt the Russian fires system. Then everything changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From late June, Ukrainian Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (GMLRS) began to target Russian command-and-control (C2) nodes and logistics hubs. As stockpile after stockpile of ammunition was destroyed, Russian guns were starved of ammunition. The sudden need to disperse C2 alongside attrition of key electronic warfare platforms opened up seams in the electromagnetic spectrum. Over the course of two weeks, the Ukrainians started locating targets and striking back. The Russians saw their fires dominance evaporate, never to be fully regained. They adapted their logistics system, pulling stockpiles back beyond GMLRS range, but this limited the number of rounds their guns could reach, rendering it impossible to achieve the level of fires saturation demanded by their doctrine. In two weeks, the Russians not only lost fires superiority, but saw a whole way of war fade into obsolescence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be reassuring to believe that the threat to logistics is a distinctly Russian problem. After all, it was GMLRS – fielded by several NATO countries – that disrupted the Russian logistics system. The Russians, meanwhile, have struggled to achieve a similar scale of disruption to Ukraine’s logistics infrastructure. This would be a hubristic level of complacency, however. An examination of how Ukrainian forces used satellite imagery to locate and map the Russian supply system, and the munitions necessary to strike its components, reveals that the technology is available and affordable even for non-state actors. Moreover, Western logistics practices are in many respects as vulnerable as Russian sustainment operations. NATO medical doctrine for warfighting is still fundamentally predicated on concentrating capacity in Role 2 and Role 3 field hospitals, with the Red Cross contributing to their protection. Ukrainian forces lost several such facilities, discovering that Russian EW-based targeting will not distinguish field hospitals from other nodes, and that the footprint of one of its Role 2 facilitiess fitted almost precisely within the lethal blast radius of a 122 mm high explosive round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any effective response to these challenges must be based on a realistic analysis of the threat. This paper begins with a summary of the “find and fires revolution”, as it applies to sustainment. There are three elements to this: ISR; connectivity; and precision strike. In turn, there follow three general problems for logisticians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;large-footprints-and-fixed-infrastructure&quot;&gt;Large Footprints and Fixed Infrastructure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The volume of materiel consumed by a large military formation is immense. An Abrams main battle tank, for example, consumes approximately 1.86 gallons of fuel per mile. A squadron traversing 10 miles of terrain could easily consume 260 gallons of fuel, not counting the fuel required for their supporting vehicles. The volumes necessary to sustain an army require the exploitation of large-scale commercial infrastructure before fuel and supplies can be broken down into deliveries to the front. Sustainment operations are therefore critically dependent on ports, terminals, rail infrastructure, storage tanks, and depots – large, fixed targets that cannot be moved rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of dispersion, viable for tactical formations, is only partially realisable for sustainment operations. This is because the greater the distance that logistics elements need to travel to resupply forces, the less efficient the logistics operation, since a greater proportion of the organisation’s resource must be used to resupply and sustain itself. In Afghanistan, where logistics infrastructure was largely uncontested, sustainment operations absorbed up to half of the force. This is not a historically unusual proportion. Rapid expansion of a logistics operation therefore comes at the expense of the efficiency of the force. Moreover, the greater the level of dispersion of logistics elements, which for reasons of efficiency are necessarily lightly armed and armoured, the greater the force protection requirement, drawing combat arms away from combat tasks. Furthermore, sustainment must flow through civilian infrastructure, such as ports, that is optimised for efficiency in peace and therefore concentrated. After this point they may begin to disperse, but they enter theatre concentrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result is that logistics and sustainment must concentrate at the operational level in large, fixed installations that are identifiable to the enemy and which often constitute single points of failure. In the Falklands campaign, a strike on the logistics hub at Ajax Bay would have immobilised much of the British force. The runway at Ascension Island constituted another potential single point of failure in the ability to maintain momentum. In Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, although there are multiple options for supplying the various fronts, Crimea, which is vital ground, is essentially dependent on two railways for resupply, one of which depends on a single prestige piece of infrastructure: the Kerch Bridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, many logistics sites were protected by two factors. First, the enemy lacked sufficiently accurate weapons to reliably destroy these targets. The US, for example, had to fly hundreds of sorties to be able to reliably damage bridges before the introduction of precision guided munitions, and even after laser designation increased accuracy, the threat to aircraft from surface-to-air missiles made such targets high risk. The second factor was the number of munitions that needed to be brought to bear to have a decisive effect. Precision munitions were expensive, while the separation of stores by berms across a depot would mean that a large number of munitions would need to be committed to destroy materiel where it was concentrated. It is also worth noting that some classes of sustainment infrastructure – notably hospitals – have protected status and ought not to be targeted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These factors no longer hold. The proliferation of cruise missile technology means that strikes against critical logistical infrastructure can be sustained without exposing crews to risk. Moreover, the maturation of cheap one-way-attack munitions, capable of damaging soft targets and striking with considerable precision, means that it is now possible to precisely strike a large volume of targets across a logistics depot, destroying stores in place. The destruction by Russian forces of several Ukrainian ammunition dumps with thermite grenades (prior to the full-scale Russian invasion) and the detonation of a Syrian Army ammunition dump at a stadium in Deir ez-Zor with improvised one-way-attack munitions demonstrate the scale of effect that is achievable by these means. The presumption of protected status, moreover, is no longer honoured by many states, rendering these facilities highly vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At higher echelon the impact of these trends is relatively straightforward. First, depots are being moved into greater depth to increase the cost of the munitions that can reach them and thereby reduce the number of strikes that are possible. This then allows for the concentration of defensive systems. However, supplies must subsequently traverse a greater area, and satisfactory solutions for the protection of sustainment capabilities in the intervening space have not yet been identified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;pattern-of-life&quot;&gt;Pattern of Life&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closer to the Forward Line of Own Troops (FLOT), the challenge is that sustainment operations create highly predicable and detectable patterns of life. Vehicles must drive through fuelling points and casualties have to be drawn back to medical facilities. Refuelling and casualty movements both require dynamic planning and thus communication, such that the medical facilities and sustainment points acquire pronounced and distinctive electromagnetic signatures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, unless a signature was maintained for a sustained period, incidental exposure provided limited opportunity to systematically map CSS elements in the deep. Today, however, Ground Moving Target Indication, space-based electromagnetic surveying and other wide-area collection systems enable the sustained observation of patterns of life throughout operational depth, including the tracking of unique signatures. When combined with modern analytical tools, the patterns that emerge over time become highly revealing. For example, if vehicles routinely pause outside a particular building when rotating to and from the front, they immediately become a point of interest, to be placed under close analysis. If synthetic aperture radar imagery can be cued to coincide with a vehicle stopping, it may become possible to confirm that it is a fuelling point. Russian strikes on medical facilities in Syria are a useful case in point. The persistent communication from these facilities, and the presence of cellular phones associated with fighters, made even subterranean facilities distinctive. For Russia, lacking concerns about international law, these facilities became targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The handover of supplies to units in motion must be based on battle drills and standard operating procedures. The selection and communication of cache points, the deconfliction of movement through the rear, and the confirmation of time of handover will all follow pre-agreed procedures that will be replicated. Sustainment, unlike many tactical actions, is a constant task and so there is a consistent pattern of life generated by a force’s tactics, techniques and procedures. These are not only detectable – increasingly so over time – but once a point has been confirmed it becomes possible to track vehicles moving to and from locations to build up a map of logistics nodes, so that the exposure of one point can contaminate others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stand-off sensors that enable this kind of observation – satellites, radar, long-range UAVs and other capabilities – are persistent and survivable. For units conducting tactical actions, the use of electronic warfare and other measures can disrupt enemy kill chains and intelligence collection for limited periods to create windows of opportunity for manoeuvre. But it is not realistic to achieve widespread denial of these capabilities over a sustained period and an expansive area. Consequently, the burden of adaptation falls to the sustainment elements&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the more that is done to protect sustainment elements, especially force protection engineering, the greater the signature of the activity and the easier it is to track and map. For example, it was possible just using commercial satellites to track the end-to-end transfer of ammunition for Russia from North Korea to the Ukraine front by observing the loading, unloading and preparations for receipt of shipping containers. The expansion of berms ahead of the arrival of these munitions was a clear indicator of where materiel would be moved, even before it was shipped. With access to real-time ISR – rather than commercial satellites with longer latency between collection and dissemination – it would be possible to track the movement forwards from these dumps and thereby establish the placement of caches or the location of batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-predictability-of-ground-lines-of-communication&quot;&gt;The Predictability of Ground Lines of Communication&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manoeuvre forces have a range of options to prevent them from being located with a high level of accuracy or, worse still, anticipated. Dispersion and the exploitation of multiple axes or unusual approaches to targets can allow them to maintain a high level of ambiguity as to their movements and dispositions while out of contact. For sustainment elements, supporting dispersed forces reduces efficiency, but is achievable. Once combat elements become engaged with the enemy, however, two important things occur. First, sustainment demand spikes, as combat forces use their ammunition at a much greater rate and begin to require evacuation of damaged vehicles and injured and dead personnel. Second, combat forces become fixed and the options for the routes by which resupply can occur become significantly constrained, especially if the contact occurs on vital ground. Resupply may be via only one or two ground lines of communication (GLOCs) to reach the fighting units. Moreover, as artillery targets rotating units or resupply convoys, the available GLOCs are degraded or destroyed, with bridges especially susceptible. Temporary bridging can alleviate this problem somewhat, but between the weight limits and damage to the roads, it is common for traffic to only be able to move in one direction over these points. This risks creating traffic jams, and so careful sequencing of forward and return traffic becomes critical. This planning requirement further constrains sustainment troops’ ability to manoeuvre, because they must deliver a significant proportion of materiel and recover casualties within specified timelines, while also having set windows of opportunity within which they can do so along GLOCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The threat to contested GLOCs has been exacerbated by UAVs. Penetrating the FLOT, UAVs will routinely seek to maintain observation over GLOCs and thereby direct artillery fire onto sustainment troops while they move. This dynamic has occurred repeatedly throughout Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, such that in some instances Ukraine has lost more personnel during troop rotations than it has in contact. The planning challenges created by the sustainment of Severodonetsk, Bakhmut and Avdiivka are instructive. In these instances, two GLOCs were preserved but were held under artillery fire. The interdiction of Russian sustainment operations over the bridges in support of Kherson are similarly illustrative of how a force can be disproportionately attrited by fixing its combat power to expose its logistics elements and then using fires to render the position unsustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defending sustainment assets once fixed in combat can be achieved. Sanitising the airspace above GLOCs for a period can be delivered by electromagnetic warfare troops and air defence. The use of fires to suppress enemy artillery during a resupply can also reduce the threat. Alternatively, engineers can work to expand the quality of the route, or the number of paths that can be taken. In extremis, logistics can be carried out by vehicles with greater off-road mobility, whether amphibious or tracked, to maintain a diversity of avenues of approach. For small and urgent deliveries, unmanned aircraft systems may be able to shuttle material forwards. The problem with all these methods is that they lead to combat arms who are in contact, diverting resources to protect resupply. This in turn increases the sustainment requirements of the force. Even increasing the mobility of the sustainment force through different vehicles necessarily comes with an increase in cost and complexity, and expands their organic support requirements. These all reduce the efficiency of the fighting force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final complication is the handover of materiel to troops. If the support to forces in contact is conducted within a constrained window of time, determined by the period when counterbattery fire and air defence can lift the threat, it encourages the maximum volume of materiel to be pushed in the smallest number of vehicles possible. The combined arms enablement of the resupply, however, means that the enemy will know what is happening. Once the supplies have arrived at the battle area, they must then be distributed to dispersed fighting elements. First, there is the risk of the supplies being struck once unloaded. Second, there is the risk that if a support element moves supplies from the unloading point to the fighting positions it will be traceable – enemy ISR would have been tipped off about the need to focus by the counterbattery fire – and so will reveal the fighting positions and separate them from the decoy fighting positions that forces are increasingly having to use to remain survivable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collectively, therefore, the find and fires revolution risks making supply of forces costly and complicated by holding fixed logistical infrastructure at sustained risk, by unpicking the supply nodes through pattern-of-life analysis in the deep using stand-off sensors, and by contesting the GLOCs to fighting units. The result of this is to diminish the ability of a force to achieve operational tempo and, by constraining the supplies that can be built up, limit the depth that units can plan to threaten and thereby limit the cognitive risk felt by the enemy. If units can only build up the ammunition, fuel and other supplies to punch a limited distance into enemy terrain before pausing, it becomes easier for the enemy to manage the release and commitment of reserves to ensure that offensive operations must always be against a deliberate, rather than a hasty, defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-adapting-resupply-to-sustain-the-force&quot;&gt;II. Adapting Resupply to Sustain the Force&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are, in very simple terms, two kinds of sustainment activity. The first is resupply – pushing materiel forwards; the second is recovery – pulling resources backwards, for example, maintenance and medical capabilities. This chapter considers the process by which materiel is moved forwards, while Chapters III and IV consider recovery. Having examined the factors that expose sustainment operations to distinct threats on the future battlefield, several conclusions can be drawn about how combat service support elements will need to adapt, and where adaptation will impose additional demands on the wider force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The principles of protection described in this chapter are not new. Dispersion, deception and convoys are techniques that have been used for centuries. However, these concepts can now be applied in particularly important ways because of emerging technologies. This chapter therefore considers the relationship between technology and emerging tactics to address an evolving threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;randomised-dispersed-storage&quot;&gt;Randomised Dispersed Storage&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider a warehouse. Traditionally, it has comprised rows of shelves on which objects are placed in a systematic order. Books, for example, might be laid out alphabetically, or boxes given serial numbers, to be stacked in sequence. Each shelf stack would have a designation. Goods that were regularly requested would be stacked closest to the door, and those objects least regularly requested stacked further from the entrance, to maximise efficiency. Such a system allowed a human logistician, who could not remember where an object was in the warehouse, to look up its location, quickly proceed to the relevant area and then move along the shelves until arriving at the correct item. Someone who had never visited the warehouse before could find the items they needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With their network of depots and storage dumps, divisional and brigade support areas follow similar patterns – orderly sites where paper-based tables allow supply personnel to enter and retrieve specific loads. Such a system means that when a spare part arrives from a higher echelon, as long as it is allocated an appropriate serial number it can be inserted in a location where it can rapidly be found. In NATO militaries, this system has evolved to work in support of a pull logistics system, whereby units flag their requirements and only the requested items are retrieved from their storage locations, reducing waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The layout of modern warehouses is changing, however. In a warehouse with a robotic retrieval system, or “smart warehouse”, it is not uncommon for the storage of items to be random. Books might be stored next to toasters and shower gel, with no particular logic other than that dissimilar items are co-located. The reasons for this are simple. For a computer, when an item is placed in the warehouse, its coordinates in three dimensions can be retained as a small data entry and remembered. Unlike the human operator there is no need for a robot to work towards an object by following a building–stack–shelf–location sequence, it can simply go to the coordinates associated with the item. Dissimilar storage reduces the likelihood of mistakes (for example, through a calibration error of a robotic arm). An error is much more likely to be detected if, in attempting to pick up a book, it finds itself clasping a shovel (as opposed to a different book). Even if the machine does not detect the error, a supervisor is more likely to notice. Randomised placement, while reducing the risk of localisation errors for robotic retrieval systems, is not space efficient, so there is much effort put into refining localisation methodologies in civilian logistics. Since the military will continue to retrieve items using humans, however, localisation does not need to be as precise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relevance of this to militaries is not that robotics can replace humans in logistics, but rather that the distribution of materiel across the battlespace need not see the concentration of like materials at centralised locations. Militaries have used GPS tags on shipping containers to assist in retrieving the appropriate boxes for some time. The problem with this is obviously that the boxes broadcast their location and that there is a high risk of GPS disruption. The digitised warehouses, however, hold the location data centrally, based on logging where it was placed. This appears to be a more viable approach, although periodic backups are necessary to avoid corruption of the database. The result is that today it is reasonable to have materiel scattered broadly in small caches all over the rear area in such a manner as to massively complicate tracking and targeting and reduce the efficiency of strikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One historical downside to dispersing logistics is the planning complications it introduces of moving materiel from depots to units. With a paper-based planning process creating orders, the need to coordinate movement to a large number of unpredictable dispersed locations every time there is the requirement to resupply a unit would take a great deal of time. It would also create a range of challenges as regards route deconfliction, and a need to coordinate laterally between different logistics units that would entail much communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference today is the ubiquity of smart planning tools. Uber Eats is perhaps the most immediately comprehensible civilian corollary. Uber Eats is premised upon a situation where a recipient will call for supply from a position that was not previously known, for materiel from a location that was not previously known, and the application must calculate the most appropriate carrier given the timing and location of both parties. Moreover, it must coordinate many of these interactions simultaneously. Uber Eats has the advantage of a highly detailed map, terrain that degrades very slowly, and ubiquitous connectivity. Nevertheless, ticketing systems could make it feasible to push jobs to elements with intermittent connectivity. The military today has the capacity to map terrain rapidly using space-based observation. Route planning that accounts for damage is harder to automate, but the process of manually updating this information is fundamentally comparable to the burden of feeding this data into staff planning. A range of technologies today, therefore, allow for storage of materiel to be effectively dispersed throughout the battle area without having a disproportionately negative impact on efficiency. Beyond the key points of theatre entry where civilian logistics anchor logistics, therefore, it becomes possible to break up the concentrated supply areas in the divisional support area, eliminating high pay-off targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ambiguous-loads&quot;&gt;Ambiguous Loads&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Safety in the carriage of ammunition and fuel is important. Incidents such as that aboard RFA have underscored the sound injunction to separate the carriage of personnel and munitions. This has since been extended to an aversion to mixing loads of most kinds in peacetime. Thus, militaries often field specialist fuel bowsers that have a distinct signature. This helps logistics in peacetime because it means the bowsers can meet safety standards and have greater freedom to drive on civilian roads. There is also an efficiency to the concentration of materiel in transit. For example, a box of ammunition will stack neatly with other boxes of ammunition because they have the same dimensions, and the tracking of materiel is also simpler if each container contains a specific type of item. Thus, a round of ammunition will sit in a box of ammunition, which will sit on a pallet of ammunition within a container shipment of ammunition, for which there will be a clear set of rules governing the transport, tracking and security of the load.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The efficiency of this approach must contend with the need to break down loads in order to actually resupply units. Few tactical units, for example, require a shipping container’s worth of ammunition. A pallet is much more manageable. Unhelpfully, they also require food, water and spares that do not pack neatly, along with many other consumables. Generally, the need to concentrate the shipping containers to be able to draw from multiple different kinds of stores is done at relatively high echelon because of the concentration of containers. Nevertheless, loads tend to remain separated, with a supply convoy having different loads on different vehicles. Resupply convoys will then move to handover points, either with the logistics unit supporting the lower echelon, or once the operation shifts from formation sustainment to unit resupply, the convoy will usually conduct a circuit, handing over several pallets from each vehicle to a receiving group from the unit, to be broken up according to the disposition of the unit and thereafter distributed to the various fighting elements. This approach is noteworthy for its simplicity and efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also increasingly vulnerable. It necessarily creates a series of interlinked circles of continuous movement, from known storage hubs to identifiable handover points, and the movement from these points can be traced forward to identify fighting positions. Moreover, the separation and distinctness of loads produces some very particular vulnerabilities. The UK’s 1 Aviation Brigade, for example, fielded eight fuel bowsers as its entire fuel capability until recently. Targeting these could potentially have grounded the brigade. Their movement from the main brigade support area could also indicate the establishment of a forward arming and refuelling point, setting up the conditions for strikes during refuelling. Measures have since been taken to address this and other vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, the example is instructive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To break the pattern-of-life vulnerability generated by the existing model and reduce the size of logistical resupply convoys, it is necessary to adopt two measures. The first is to increase the ambiguity of loads by pulling shipping containers further forward in the battlespace. The second is to shift to mixed loads, not of people and ammunition, but of different kinds of stores. Clearly, when containers are shipped into the theatre, efficiency will drive them to be concentrated, as is currently the case. However, at the theatre sustainment level, it becomes desirable to unpack these containers and pack containers with unit-relevant caches comprising mixed loads. Some loads, such as fuel, cannot be readily mixed, but should still be pumped into bladders within containers, thereby rendering the contents of any given shipment ambiguous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medical stores and facilities have traditionally been visibly distinct, partly as medical elements are specifically protected under international humanitarian law (IHL) if they hold to their duties of neutrality and do not, for example, engage in moving ammunition or other lethal supplies. Critically, this protection has been shown to be ineffective in many current conflicts, with hospitals now becoming specific targets. It may therefore be reasonable, or indeed necessary, to hide medical stores and even units in the plain sight of general supplies. Rendering medical capabilities indistinguishable from other stores, rather than actually mixing loads with them, is compatible with IHL, although it means that enemies who strike these facilities have the defence that it was not possible to discriminate between them and legitimate targets. This approach may be highly context dependent, as some adversaries may show greater respect for non-combatant status than Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exact contents of a container cache depends entirely on the formation being supported and the planning assumptions of its levels of consumption. However, to use straw man figures to illustrate the process, in intense periods of fighting an infanteer can expect to need 616 rounds of 5.56 mm ammunition per day, assuming a carriage of 10 magazines, plus one in the rifle, and one full replenishment. Often they carry fewer, but this is the upper limit. If they were carrying fewer, many would use the saved weight to carry additional rounds for machine guns or other support weapons. Thus, a company plus attachments, roughly 150 people, will need approximately 92,400 5.56 mm rounds or equivalents per day in intense fighting. An ammunition box holds approximately 1,200 rounds of 5.56 mm. A standard pallet measuring 100 cm x 120 cm can hold approximately 21 boxes, so that four pallets can carry 100,800 rounds. Four pallets can also carry enough 24-hour ration packs for an equivalent number of troops. Thus, packed with the rations over the ammunitions, food and ammunition for a company for a day can fit into a 10-ft shipping container. A standard lorry could either carry a second 10-ft container for other kinds of stores, like batteries and water, or a single 20-ft shipping container, with all stores in the same container.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than a handover point, there could be a process whereby mission caches are carried from the operational hub in small packets of vehicles and the containers dropped in the rear of a unit. The location of the drop and the contents of the container is uploaded to the logistics system. When it comes time for the unit to retrieve its supplies, its close support logistics element raises a ticket with the logistics C2 system and is assigned a location, or several options, where the requested stores can be found. They can then retrieve the pallets, leaving the container, while informing the logistics C2 system of what was taken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first instance, this may not sound very different in its implications to the current process. Over a relatively short period of time, however, the effect is to distribute many containers across the rear area, some of which are empty, while others remain full, some of which contain fuel and others not, and some of which contain specialist loads, while others contain standard stores. It rapidly becomes highly ambiguous for the adversary to know where anything is, or what any pattern might be. Containers can, of course, be periodically retrieved. Or one of the containers whose contents have not been depleted may be moved further forward as the force advances. The result, however, is to break any consistent pattern as to where close support logistics elements go, and thus mitigate the threat from pattern-of-life analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;planned-predictive-push-and-last-mile-resupply&quot;&gt;Planned Predictive Push and Last Mile Resupply&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current logistics approach in most NATO militaries is primarily a pull logistics system at tactical echelons. Units call for what they need, and the logisticians work out how to get it to them. Logisticians may well pre-position stores that they anticipate being needed, but this is usually driven by the manoeuvre formations’ planning process, with the logistics plan intended to enable the scheme of manoeuvre. The logisticians work under the manoeuvre forces for several reasons, but an important one is that the manoeuvre forces take the highest burden of the risk, and therefore the logistics troops are combat service support. Ultimately, UK doctrine stipulates that “sustainment is a means to an end. Sustainment should always support the mission”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future operating environment is one in which targeting logistics is likely to be systematic among advanced militaries, because of the disproportionate impact it has on the capacity of combat forces to operate. Moreover, rather than logistics troops being a high pay-off target of opportunity, militaries increasingly have the means to reach over one another and strike the tail. The result is that logisticians must be significantly more proactive in planning their movements. Consequently, movement will often be discontinuous from the wider scheme of manoeuvre. The caching of materiel rather than its handover is a good example of something that facilitates this transition. The logistics planners may also require the support of combat arms in some instances, to shape conditions for access. This is especially true of electronic warfare troops and air defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A critical enabler for moving to an efficient push model is data. If the distance between centralised supply depots and the front is extending, then the risk is that critical materiel cannot reach units in time. This requires the right volumes of the right things to be pushed forwards in anticipation of need. Historically, push systems have been robust but inefficient. However, accurate predictive modelling can drive efficiency, drawing on data on actual consumption under various conditions. Since the caches are containerised, there is also less of a cost if the materiel is not used. It can be left in the container and recovered later, although it may be necessary to deny some critical materiel if it is at risk of being overrun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combined arms element of the logistics plan becomes especially relevant in last mile resupply, from the caches to the sub-units. This will inevitably require movement along exposed GLOCs. The breakdown of company supplies to roughly four tactical vehicles allows for a small footprint to move rapidly along a GLOC. This ensures that only the most responsive fires are likely to prove a threat. UAVs, however, either directing artillery or striking themselves, are a major threat during this phase. The most effective means of reducing this threat are air defence engagements against larger UAVs and electronic protection against ISR and smaller strike UAVs. Navigational jamming is especially important, as even if an adversary gets a UAV over the convoy, it significantly complicates the accuracy of engagements. Disruption of navigation is not just applied against the UAV but also against the launcher, further corrupting the enemy kill chain. Jamming of control frequencies, meanwhile, is important for protection against terminally guided UAVs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air defence assets are scarce, while electronic warfare capabilities risk causing considerable disruption to friendly C2 if they are not deconflicted with friendly activity. It is therefore very important that the mechanisms exist for logistics units to call upon and receive this support from the combat arms, which in turn requires the planning process to be responsive in processing these requests and applying appropriate control measures and deconfliction procedures. Support engineering, whether for mobility support or force protection, is another function that logisticians may need to call upon to expand their options. Here the deconfliction requirement is in capacity, rather than fratricide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further critical function is logistical reconnaissance. This enables proactive push logistics by identifying areas that are appropriate for caches, and enabling the preparation of optimal sites for receipt of caches. For example, if pushing into an industrial area, warehouses or other facilities with large spaces with overhead protection offer a great opportunity to disguise and conceal dispersed caches. Route access, vehicle clearances and what to do with what might already be in the warehouses all require information to plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planning for the positioning of caches also provides an anticipated laydown that can be used by the joint force to plan protection of logistical supplies. The requirement here is not that each cache be allocated a cordon of troops, which would be prohibitively burdensome. Nevertheless, it does make sense for shipping containers containing ammunition to be kept under observation. This could be achieved by remotely rigging a camera and running the feed from it via cable to a hide position. Locking the container can also create a barrier to civilians tampering with the contents. Simply having troops with overwatch of the site, rather than ringing it, is sufficient in many environments. Of course, even having troops in overwatch would be onerous if it is a dedicated task. However, on a battlefield where reserves need to remain dispersed, logistical reconnaissance proves to be the basis to plan hiding positions for reserve troops, such that there is coincidental force protection for stores without driving concentration. A further function of this reconnaissance is that it provides information to identify points to which materiel might be recovered. Via these means, therefore, using digitised C2 to disperse logistics hubs, moving ambiguous loads, and taking a combined arms approach to resupply, it becomes possible to resupply the force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-medical-support&quot;&gt;III. Medical Support&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although some medical supplies require special handling, the provision of medical logistics forwards can be made robust through the wider techniques discussed in Chapter II. Medical support, however, entails a greater reverse logistical component; significant effort is expended treating casualties and then bringing them away from the frontline. Also, the adversary often sets the level of demand, at a time and location of choosing. This chapter considers necessary adaptations to medical support on the future battlefield. It focuses on discrete medical capabilities – rather than on those intrinsic to the fighting units – and looks in particular at additional pre-hospital care teams and forward Role 2 surgical capabilities, as these are likely to be most impacted by recent developments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;prioritising-mobility-in-medical-capability&quot;&gt;Prioritising Mobility in Medical Capability&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transparent battlefield will always expose a medical treatment facility (MTF). Even if the MTF itself can be hidden (for example, underground), the casualties flowing to and from it will always set a distinctive pattern; for example, researchers were able to map the first surge in Covid-19 medical attendances in Wuhan using satellite imagery of hospital car parks. They will also be highly visible in the electromagnetic spectrum, because of the C2 required to facilitate casualty movement and reach-back for specialist advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loss of an MTF will hugely complicate the demands placed on other support elements and will directly affect the psyche of the fighting force and the population at home, putting a state’s political will to the test. This combination of visibility and value makes healthcare a logical target. IHL aspired to mitigate this by making medical units non-combatant – taking them out of the fight and protecting them, in return for their duty to treat any and all who need it. Sadly, this protection is ineffective. Attacks on MTFs are commonplace; the WHO recorded 806 in 18 countries in the first 10 months of 2023. In some conflicts, MTF targeting appears to be state policy – most notably Syria, where 274 government-attributed attacks affected hospitals, compared with only one on a school in the same timeframe. Attacks on military medical facilities are rarely publicised in Ukraine, for reasons of operational security, but are nevertheless frequent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that hospitals will be found and targeted, the enemy imposes a critical decision on planners. Should they place medical facilities beyond the range of attack (and/or harden them to survive), or simply make them very difficult to target? With long-range precision fires, a static MTF can never be close enough to deliver life-saving interventions early and remain safe from attack, unless it is also protected. This concept is not new – underground hospitals were used during the First World War and are commonplace in parts of Syria and Ukraine. However, this brings additional constraints, dramatically reducing the number of feasible deployment sites and fixing the facility. Critically, while this approach protects the hospital, the rest of the network assumes proportionally greater risk; even if varying routes and timings, ambulances and resupply always end up at the same place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US is already moving away from fixed canvas or opportunistic hard-standing for C2 nodes, “focus(ing) on mobility as the chief mechanism for survivability”. For Role 2 MTFs to achieve this level of mobility, they must either be smaller, limiting capacity, or subdivided, limiting efficiency. The size of vehicle required to enable truly mobile medical provision has historically been considered unfeasible. But with Boxer command vehicles (7.93 m long and 3 m wide) assessed as survivable on the battlefield, that assumption is no longer tenable. The total size (and hence capacity) of an MTF still presents challenges. A common Role 2 configuration contains: two resuscitation beds; one operating table; two intensive care beds; a ward area (up to 12 beds); as well as x-ray and laboratory equipment, and blood fridges. That significant footprint actually works in favour of the distributed model. Role 2s usually experience relatively little clinical activity. Mass is only required when demand for life-saving damage control resuscitation (DCR) peaks. A modular approach would allow smaller, dispersed units (each containing, for example, an operating table, an intensive care bed and a blood fridge) to move closer to likely points of demand. Modules would only come together and reconstitute mass when absolutely needed, for exactly as long as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highly mobile MTFs bring considerable advantages: they can move whenever there is a risk that they have been targeted; RVs with resupply or evacuation platforms can be different every time; they can easily be redeployed if reinforcement is needed elsewhere; they can operate far closer to the point of wounding, potentially increasing the pool of salvageable patients that can be reached; they can set up in a far wider range of locations; and they can always choose to fix in an ideal location (even a distant, underground, protected one) if that suits the operation, whereas a static hospital can never choose to move in anything approaching a relevant timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mobility also brings considerable challenges, most notably the significant changes to TTPs that will be required to cope with movement and their reduced capacity, and the vast increase in coordination (and so communication) and logistical support to manage many moving parts. Perhaps most important, if it fails to move in time, a mobile MTF is much more likely to be destroyed. While dispersal will reduce the likelihood of a strike being mission-killing, it is unlikely to be hardened to the same degree as a static facility, and so there will be losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;adapting-ttps-to-enable-mobility&quot;&gt;Adapting TTPs to Enable Mobility&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surgery cannot yet take place in the face of vibration and sudden movements. While a static facility can operate continuously, a mobile unit can only deliver care when stationary. That said, Defence Medical Services surgeons have confirmed that most DCR procedures could be tactically paused for 10 minutes, given five minutes’ notice to move, allowing doctors to “cross-clamp” major blood vessels and then secure safety harnesses. This would allow a targeted vehicle to rapidly relocate, then apply the brakes and continue the procedure. Clearly this would not meet the NHS standard of care – and will likely result in worse outcomes for some than if the operation was never interrupted – but on a battlefield, it offers the best balance of urgency and safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treatment would need to be reconceptualised in tactical bounds, interspersed by very short-notice moves. This applies equally to tactical medical evacuation (MEDEVAC). In Ukraine, enemy air defence coverage means that patients must be transported by ground vehicles; terrain (and the time needed to cross it) becomes critical in determining what treatments can be undertaken and when. Delivery of care in ambulances moving on roads is difficult; over rough terrain it is impossible. The holy grail of “in-transit care”, which brought such improvements in survival in Afghanistan and Iraq, will at best be replaced with “interrupted transit care”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Timelines must also be re-evaluated. For logistical enablers, MEDEVAC will compete with the forward movement of ammunition. Commanders will prioritise the latter, as ammunition scarcity will increase casualties through reduced suppression of the enemy, perhaps even leading to defeat of the force, whereas delayed evacuation of casualties will only impact the minority of salvageable wounded. This calculus, along with the practicalities of movement under fire, has at times pushed casualty evacuation in Ukraine to over 15 hours. While enhancements to Role 1 facilities and the continuing focus on prolonged field care will mitigate this problem somewhat, fundamentally, the force must either accept clearly preventable deaths, or move advanced care forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risking scarce medical expertise forwards will demand clarity on who these personnel are there to care for. The human body is remarkably robust and survives most injuries, even if care is significantly delayed – 99.2% of all UK armed forces personnel treated in the hospital at Camp Bastion survived. Sadly, some will die, regardless of the proximity and capability of medical services, as their injuries are simply too severe to recover from. Of all UK service personnel killed in action in Afghanistan, 87% died before reaching hospital – two-thirds within 10 minutes of injury. Even with the current pace of innovation, it is unlikely this figure will improve significantly in the foreseeable future, as access to the necessary advanced care inside that timeframe will rarely be feasible while in contact. The patients who will benefit from advanced medical care in this environment are those who will die if untreated but are “salvageable” given the right level of care (DCR) in the right timeframe. These patients hide among the 35% who were not killed immediately, but died in what is currently the pre-hospital stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How long do they have to reach DCR? There is a 33% survival benefit if surgery is accessible within an hour, but the ideal timeframe is probably shorter; giving blood only improves survival within 36 minutes of injury. Experienced military pre-hospital doctors did not believe they could keep salvageable patients alive for two hours pending surgery. The inescapable conclusion is that salvageable patients need advanced pre-hospital care surgery, well within the first hour, not the two proposed in NATO doctrine when the medical system is under strain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/W5pBJH1.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Analysis of Time to Death for Those Killed in Action.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Stacey Webster et al., “Killed in Action (KIA): An Analysis of Military Personnel Who Died of Their Injuries Before Reaching a Definitive Medical Treatment Facility in Afghanistan”, BMJ Military Health (Vol. 167, 2021), pp. 84–88. Reproduced with permission.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each DCR vehicle would probably only have space for one surgeon, an assistant and an anaesthetic practitioner. Single-surgeon teams always run the risk that they are the “wrong” specialist for a given problem; for example, an orthopaedic (limb) surgeon faced with an abdominal wound or a general (abdominal) surgeon treating an amputation of a limb could not typically deal with the injury completely within their normal scope of practice. But in Defence, both can be made competent in the immediate control of any bleeding, even if it is not in their specialist area. The “clamshell thoracotomy”, taught to all UK pre-hospital doctors (who are typically not surgeons at all) is one such technique. With minimal equipment, the practitioner opens the patient’s chest to access the heart and main blood vessels. Once the bleeding is controlled – on average 4.6 minutes later – they have bought some time for rendezvous with the ideal team to continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These modules could operate in “pods”, with multiple surgical vehicles supported by a mobile intensive care ward (which could also undertake MEDEVAC). If patients need a larger or reconfigured team, the vehicles could come together for a short period, reorganise to provide the interventions needed and then disperse again. Fresh modules can be en route (bringing critical resupply) while full modules can MEDEVAC back to the next echelon of care. This would also build resilience in the event that a vehicle is hit; the remaining surgical and critical care capability will still endure, ready to be fully regenerated by vehicles moving from another area to support, or battle casualty replacements arriving. In the event of mass casualty incidents (MCI), multiple pods could converge on the affected areas, boosting medical cover at critical moments in a way that static facilities never could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Ueukfab.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: Patient Movement Towards Modular vs Traditional Role 2.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Author generated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Containerising these modules allows them to be delivered by any platform “fitted for, rather than with”, enabling far greater transport flexibility. If an operation required them to take up a static position, they could be placed into dug-out scrapes or underground, dramatically increasing their protection. For concealment and deception they could be sited anywhere a container would not look out of place, such as a supermarket supply entrance, ready to be picked up and redeployed when needed. Two-operating table collapsible versions of such modules exist (within standard 6-m ISO-container dimensions). While these cannot contain patients while “collapsed”, they illustrate the feasibility of the concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The natural state of the MTF should be dispersed over a kilometre or more, operating within 30 minutes of the units for which it is providing support, and either in motion or moving frequently (and able to change location immediately). If static, it should be hidden and/or protected. It can be in the vicinity of defences and enablers (excavators and so on), but dispersed enough to not draw fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;precision-triage-treatment-and-palliative-care&quot;&gt;Precision Triage, Treatment and Palliative Care&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This construct only provides the care necessary to save lives that would otherwise be lost. Most medical care falls outside that definition. Disease and non-battle injury will continue to be the predominant source of medical work (and thus logistical effort), as it has for centuries. In general, these risks are predictable and well understood, and force protection (while heavily reduced over the years) remains effective. In contrast, unpredictable demand will normally be driven by enemy action. The general threat of attack is predictable, but the timings and impact of attacks will be highly variable. Intelligent demand planning will enable more routine rather than emergent resupply, but as the enemy always has a say, the system will have to be ready for large and unexpected spikes. NATO modelling suggests high-tempo combat operations might reasonably result in 600 to 1,000 casualties per day, which anecdotally is close to the Ukrainian experience. In such MCI, the 50% or more triaged to the lowest urgency (“walking wounded”) have a survival rate of over 97%, even if care is delayed. Given that small, mobile surgical teams are extremely limited in their capacity, patients who do not need DCR cannot go to them, or they will be overwhelmed almost immediately. Three other treatment and evacuation pathways are therefore needed in parallel to DCR: treatment of minor injuries, returning the soldier to the fight; non-time-critical injuries that exceed the capability of Role 1 and so must move to high-capacity hospitals in the rear; and providing a comfortable, dignified death for those who will succumb regardless of treatment, without consuming resuscitation capacity that others need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To manage four treatment pathways, Role 1 must be empowered to triage patients accurately, putting patients into the correct pipeline as early as possible. While triage is easy in concept, it is very challenging in reality. The systems taught in NATO are designed for the lowest levels of medical provider. They are simple, but that constrains their accuracy. Because medical resources were abundant in recent conflicts, triage was optimised to be sensitive – trying not to miss someone who needs DCR. Sensitivity is bought at the cost of specificity; the ability to protect resources by not allocating them to people who do not need them. Current systems are around 60% sensitive and 70% specific; in a 100-patient incident with “classical” casualty distributions (where 10 need DCR, 20 can be delayed and 70 are walking wounded) these tools would send 12 patients to the Role 2. Unfortunately, six of those would be “over-triaged”, not needing DCR, but displacing six others who did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over-triage can be mitigated by forward deployment of enhanced pre-hospital care. Existing force structures allow for two such teams in every medical regiment, led by an emergency medicine (EM) doctor. Thus far their role has been poorly articulated and rarely exercised. EM doctors have vast trauma experience and are highly capable of selecting out the patients who need DCR. Typically, they operate around 90% sensitivity and 85% specificity; in the above scenario they would also have sent 12 patients to DCR, but nine of these would have needed it. With enhanced capabilities such as ultrasound they may well be even more accurate. This layer of precision triage must be applied as soon after injury as possible, which will require real-time sharing of video and physiological measurements. This will obviate the need for casualties to be physically concentrated at the Role 1 for triage to take place. Forward EM can also start DCR at Role 1 for those who need it (assuming the Role 2 is not able to access them directly, faster), and will increase the capacity of Role 1. Casualties who exceed the capabilities of a reinforced Role 1 but do not need DCR typically require only limited medical input in the forward areas. They need to move to the rear as soon as it is safe. In many cases this might be facilitated by remote advice and monitoring from the enhanced Role 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The capacity of Role 1 to return soldiers to the fight must also be increased. At the moment, even relatively minor wounds (for example a 30 cm laceration) would normally move back to an Role 2/3 for management. Advances in pain relief; the ability to cleanse large and complex wounds; and the advent of smart dressings and splints, which could reduce pain, encourage healing and even warn of developing infection, may play pivotal roles in the rapid return to duty. Unfortunately, these areas are not privileged in terms of research funding. There should also be a focus on the “lowest capable provider” concept, artificially increasing the available workforce by protocolising treatments and innovating delivery mechanisms that make treatments safer and easier to administer, making them accessible to lower-trained personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Palliation is a normal part of hospital medical care, but to be effective in war it needs to be firmly established at Role 1. It must be supported by effective training and development of protocols and equipment that allow patients to die in comfort and dignity, even in adverse and austere conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;digitising-medical-c2&quot;&gt;Digitising Medical C2&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The changes proposed above depend on data and effective C2. Mobile Role 2 and highly interconnected Role 1 telemedicine will come at huge cost in terms of bandwidth and assured communications. This will only get worse when commanders harvest the real-time information benefits of wearable devices (such as smart watches). If these become a normal part of the C2 architecture, it is inevitable that medics will take advantage of the ability to monitor the physiological state of the force. Closely linked to the problem of exponentially increasing information is the requirement for the medical C2 system to degrade gracefully in the face of electronic warfare. The system must assume that at times it will not be able to pass information freely, and so effective backup systems will be necessary. These challenges must not be taken on by Defence Medical Services alone, but rather must be rolled up into the similar and far larger problem faced by logistics as a whole. The capabilities and TTPs outlined above should improve the provision of medical support to deployed forces under modern battlefield conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iv-maintenance-recovery-and-repair&quot;&gt;IV. Maintenance, Recovery and Repair&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use vehicles and equipment in combat is to have them damaged. Furthermore, high pressure, heavy weights and sudden travel on uneven surfaces put stress through vehicles and systems that guarantees failures. This is inevitable, irrespective of how well-designed a platform is, with or without the enemy. When the effect of fire comes into play, especially during offensive manoeuvre, it is evident that vehicles will be damaged in large numbers. Being able to recover and repair these damaged vehicles is the difference between the force being able to sustain its operations and degrading rapidly, losing mobility and combat power. Decisive damage to enemy formations is often achieved when maintenance areas are overrun. This chapter, therefore, explores how maintenance and repair can be improved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;digital-twins-and-predictive-maintenance&quot;&gt;Digital Twins and Predictive Maintenance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are different approaches to maintaining complex systems around the world. The Soviet model was to track how long a system had been used and replace components at specified intervals. The assumption was that within a given period, some components would have become compromised, but the probability that enough components were damaged to impair the functioning of the device was acceptably low. This allowed for a systematic push logistics system for sustaining complex equipment like helicopters and electronic warfare platforms. NATO’s approach has largely been to continually check systems and repair them based on the identification of faults. This approach is maintenance intensive but allows for the fielding of more precise systems as the tolerances for a system where a proportion of parts are expected to fail are necessarily greater. The NATO system also requires spares to be called forward responsively when faults are discovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of a digital twin has been pursued for some time. A digital twin is a digital representation of a system that accurately reflects how it is operating. The concept is becoming increasingly viable for two reasons. First, as platforms increasingly depend on software for their operation, the data they collect during operation on their own functioning is built in. It is not adding complex functionality, but exploiting what is already enabling the system to function. Second, as design has become digitised, files are also created against which the functioning of the system can be compared, so that digital twins can be calibrated at the point of manufacture. Comparison of the data received and the ideal performance characteristics can not only identify what exactly has broken but, as stress begins to move across a system to compensate for the irregular functioning of a component, detect that components are going to fail in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The increased efficiency of predictive maintenance based on accurate mission data is best illustrated with helicopters. Using digital twins, Sikorsky has had the approved fatigue life of critical components in its helicopters extended by the Federal Aviation Authority by up to 75%, owing to the accumulation of precise data on fatigue over time compared with the assessed probable fatigue rate based on mathematical projections during the initial testing of the airframes. Using such models, it becomes possible to not only preserve functioning components for longer and reduce the time and tooling required in vulnerable positions to diagnose faults, but also to anticipate what may break, and thereby push forward and cache relevant spare parts before they must be changed. Digital twins therefore offer the opportunity to both reduce the forward logistics required by maintainers and to limit the footprint of those areas where vehicles are maintained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital twins require that maintainers can plug into the system and download its mission data for transmission to update the twin at periodic intervals. One problem is that this reduces the viability of modifying vehicles in ways that cannot be represented in the twin. If additional armour or armaments, for example, significantly alter the pattern of vibration or weight distribution, there is a risk that faults will appear when the system is operating normally. Furthermore, basic mechanical systems that lack internal monitoring will not be able to generate the data to support digital twins. For this, and a range of other reasons, digital twins will likely be prioritised for those systems that are highly software enabled, such as air defences, and for complex systems such as helicopters. Autonomous vehicles will also be prime candidates to follow this process. Many platforms – where the aim is to reduce their unit cost and to ruggedise their performance – will not have a digital twin nor the sensors to self-monitor. It is therefore important that while this capability is seized where it adds value, it is not pursued by militaries in a manner that drives spiralling complexity and cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managing an effective digital twin requires a different approach to intellectual property (IP) in contracting. During war, the adaptation of platforms must happen rapidly in response both to threat and to industrial pressures and supply chain disruption. If this adaptation cannot be paired with the digital twin, the system of predictive maintenance breaks down. However, if a company owns the digital twin, it essentially has a monopoly and a great deal of leverage in any adaptations to the platform. Militaries may argue that as they are buying the physical product they should also receive and own the digital product. The problem is that the digital product also necessarily contains IP that companies will wish to retain. The need to avoid being locked in to a single vendor must, therefore, be balanced against offering protection to companies’ IP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;additive-manufacture-and-modularity&quot;&gt;Additive Manufacture and Modularity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With digital twins only relevant for a proportion of military systems, simpler mechanical systems and components can be repaired and maintained by other means, while similarly reducing the signature of facilities and the pattern of life caused by a constant flow of forward supply. The two most relevant methods are additive manufacturing and modular platform design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to hold large containerised 3D printers forwards means that mechanical parts can, as long as digitised drawings are available, be printed in response to need. Thus, if a vehicle suffers damage or a component fails, this can be reported and printed at the point of repair, with no need to hold large stocks of spares, locate them and transport them to the front. This reduces not only the movement of materiel but also the number of pieces of information that must be transmitted within the support system. There are issues with the longevity of 3D printed parts, and a risk that different heat treatment may displace stress to another part of a system, cascading damage. Advances in 3D printing will improve the fidelity of the parts, and often the longevity issue surpasses the anticipated life of the vehicle in combat, even if this is a sub-optimal approach for a fleet being maintained in peacetime. 3D printing does require raw materials to work. Raw materials can, however, be moved forwards more efficiently than finished parts. They generally pack more efficiently, and because a body of raw material can be turned into a wide range of parts, there is less wastage through the movement and stockpiling of parts that end up not being needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many vehicles today contain complex systems that are not likely to be 3D printed forwards. Although additive manufacture is being used to print circuitry into the body of systems, for example, this requires highly sophisticated machine tooling that would not be economical to push forwards. Thus, while mechanical components can be printed and replaced on systems, electronic subsystems likely cannot. As the sophistication of these components increases, the skills and tools required to repair them also increase. Rapidly, the maintenance system begins to suffer from workforce constraints. The efficiency of the maintenance system can, however, be greatly bolstered through modular design. For example, vehicles are increasingly carrying complex sensors, from electro-optical balls to radar. These can and will be damaged if the vehicle comes under fire. They are very precise components and the tolerances involved mean that these sensors are unlikely to be able to be printed. The vehicle is also likely to be uncompetitive without its sensors. However, if the vehicle has a hard-point interface for the sensor, with contact surfaces that transfer power and extract data from a sensor, the maintainer can simply remove the entire damaged sensor, replace it with a new sensor and send the damaged sensor rearwards for it to be repaired in a location where appropriate equipment and trained personnel can be safely based. Unlike medical support, time for these repairs is non-critical. Modularity also enables the change of the sensor payload over time, noting that this may require updates to the mission data files on the vehicle to be able to ingest and display different kinds of sensor data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The virtue of modular components in terms of the survivability of repair and maintenance is that they significantly reduce the time window during which maintainers are concentrated with the damaged vehicle. Rather than working on the platform, it becomes possible to simply approach it, remove the damaged modular part, replace it and withdraw with the damaged part. The standardisation of components, and in particular the hard-point interfaces, across a force can further facilitate this process, as it reduces the range of parts that must be held by the logistics system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;deception-as-force-protection&quot;&gt;Deception as Force Protection&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the reduced signature and increased tempo of repairs achievable through precise systems monitoring, predictive maintenance, additive manufacturing and modular design, many vehicles will need to receive attention for a protracted period and may also require equipment with a large footprint. Changing the engine on a large armoured vehicle, for example, likely requires a crane, and even once a power pack is replaced, it often takes time to confirm that wiring and other sub-systems are interfacing with the system properly. Cranes have a large signature. Many of the systems used by maintainers – additive manufacturing, for example – also rely on power, so there must be an electromagnetic spectrum signature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it is accepted that repair systems are critical for maintaining tempo, then having repair sites in the indirect fire zone is unavoidable. One of the best means of protecting these facilities is through deception, rather than concealment. One of the advantages that repair workshops have in this context is that they have some of the best decoys possible: actual vehicles that have either been battle damaged or cannibalised and are therefore now disposable. The difference between a damaged or destroyed vehicle and one that is damaged and awaiting repair is not analytically easy to determine. It is also possible for functional vehicles to conceal themselves as damaged. Since maintainers have the tools for moving vehicles, they can hide in the noise of battle damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with these measures, however, there is a growing tendency for militaries to strike damaged vehicles to prevent their recovery. In many instances, vehicles can be more cheaply immobilised or damaged than destroyed, but once immobilised they can be economically destroyed when the battle allows. Again, deception is a key technique for preserving damaged vehicles from follow-up strikes. For example, the burning of tyres, or similar material, next to a damaged vehicle will product black smoke, which is almost always perceived as an indicator that the vehicle is on fire and will therefore suffer warping and other permanent damage from heat that will render it non-recoverable. This, and similar techniques like reporting the vehicle as destroyed over communications systems, can allow for damaged vehicles to remain in place for later recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with these techniques, recovery and repair workshops will likely be pushed back. It will also therefore be essential to find protection from overhead observation for key equipment such as cranes. The use of industrial buildings, for example, is ideal because it provides overhead cover, as well as being mainly empty space. Battle damage assessment through corrugated iron roofs, for example, is difficult. Energy provision, meanwhile, can partly be handled through burying generators or drawing from civilian infrastructure in depth. The problem with this approach, like field hospitals established in hardened infrastructure, is that it is not dynamically available for different axes. However, unlike casualties, vehicles do not deteriorate rapidly over time once damaged, so the extended timeline to reach maintenance is not a mission critical constraint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has assessed the challenges presented to tactical sustainment operations during high-intensity warfare. The paper posits that the capacity to find and strike throughout operational depth makes sustainment functions increasingly vulnerable. Past procedures, from centralising sustainment hubs for efficiency to consistent handover points between echelons, and the combat arms setting the demand for sustainment functions, all exacerbate the threat and thus the sustainability of the force. To mitigate these challenges, this paper has argued that clusters of technologies are allowing the expanded application of well-established principles, including dispersion, deception and convoys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed adaptations to the sustainment of the force may make the force more resilient, but that does not mean that the planning assumptions with which combat arms plan and execute operations are unaffected. The volume of materiel that can be accumulated from dispersed caches, the duration of the window of opportunities to push or pull materiel along contested GLOCs, and the scale of operations at which genuine ambiguity is achieved all necessarily have significant implications for how the combat arms approach the expenditure and commitment of their units. Attempting to reach exact conclusions on these questions in this paper would be premature. It would require extensive wargaming and experimentation to produce a robust answer. However, several hypotheses as to the impact of contested logistics on combat arms activities can be suggested for further enquiry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One critical question is the impact of the system described upon the tempo of operations. Mobile medical capability should enable medical provision to keep pace with advancing forces. By contrast, the ability to achieve ambiguity of cargo and to disperse reduces dramatically as caches must follow an advancing force. It follows that even using these techniques, a force has a limit of advance before its logistics can be targeted and its momentum severed. The critical question, therefore, is how far combat arms assess that they can punch, and how wide a salient must be before ambiguity and dispersion of support functions can be maintained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another critical question that arises for combat arms is the judgement of how much equipment can in fact be recovered. Once equipment is pulled back behind the FLOT, the techniques described in this paper may be able to obscure the repair process sufficiently to bring vehicles back into the fight. However, if recovering damaged vehicles proves non-viable, given the ability to cheaply and precisely deliver follow-up strikes, it may be that the proportion of equipment that is destroyed rather than damaged increases. If this is the case it may have profound implications for how vehicles are designed, for if it is not anticipated that they will be recovered and repaired, there will be a drive to minimise the number of specialist systems mounted on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also the question of the tail’s tail. A Role 2 hospital that must constantly traverse rough terrain is going to have breakdowns and may need mobility support to cross certain obstacles. A logistics system premised on dispersing caches off road needs a high level of mobility, but will wear out vehicles. Dispersed forces also need greater organic firepower for force protection. There will be a point at which the logistics system is consuming too much materiel and is limiting the efficiency of the force. Finding the balance is critically important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combination of understanding how many logistics vehicles can be efficiently sustained and how many caches can be pushed into an area before the logistics system loses its protection gives an indication as to how much materiel can be held within a given area. This in turn determines the size of combat arms that can be supported for a given front. This is a vital equation, because it sets the force density that the combat arms must be optimised to deal with, and thus the levels of mutual support, lethality and ammunition consumption that the force can sustain. Getting this equation wrong risks having the force overmatched along the front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point of these concluding observations is that far too often force development starts with the combat arms and then allocates sustainment resources based on their anticipated supply requirements. There is still merit to this process, but it is also important – now that sustainment functions are themselves directly threatened – to work in the other direction. Without calculating what size of forces can be sustained, over what distances and at what tempo, the risk is that armies try to build combined arms formations that lack stamina in the fight. Sustainment may be a means to an end rather than an end in itself, but if neglected, it will still lose a force a war.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;陳梓華：黎智英指「勇武派令到個畫面唔靚」 冀聯絡領袖籲克制免失國際支持&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;陳梓華指登報團隊就去向有分歧 事後李宇軒和攬炒巴等人主導「重光團隊」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/lio5E9Q.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（15日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第60日審訊。陳梓華繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供，他提及於2019年7月，在民主黨元老李柱銘的邀請之下出席飯局，並首次與黎智英見面。陳引述黎稱有需要聯絡他的話，可以透過 Mark Simon。黎又特別要求陳嘗試聯絡勇武派領袖，因為「呢啲勇武派令到個畫面唔靚」、「咁樣會失去國際支持，尤其係美國嘅支持」，所以希望與他們聯絡和對話，籲他們克制。惟陳稱難以聯絡勇武派領袖，所以後來坦白跟黎說「我聯絡唔到」。陳另提到，他在香港一個G20報紙展覽中墊支約3萬元，而 Mark Simon 願意贊助，後來便把相關款項歸還給他。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已認罪的被告陳梓華第二天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。由控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行作主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指李宇軒需使用蘋果新聞圖片-致電mark-simon獲告知已處理&quot;&gt;陳梓華指李宇軒需使用《蘋果》新聞圖片 致電Mark Simon獲告知已處理&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華供稱，在2019年6月G20峰會全球文宣登報行動之後，「攬炒團隊」籌辦第二次登報行動，因為當時「攬炒團隊」認為修訂逃犯條例削弱了香港的自由，亦違反了中英聯合聲明，所以希望透過登報來公開譴責中共違反中英聯合聲明。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，李宇軒「當時佢有嘗試說服我入 group，但我好快拒絕咗」。後來2019年7月，李有找他幫忙，關於一張鄧小平當年簽署中英聯合聲明的新聞圖片，李指相片的版權屬於《蘋果日報》，惟陳不理解李為何要用這張相片。陳當時向李說：「如果唔急，我可以遲少少見黎智英嘅時候問吓」，惟李稱「好急」，所以陳致電黎智英的私人助手 Mark Simon，「然後 Mark Simon 話呢件事早就處理咗喇。」而且使用該相片不需要支付任何費用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱獲李柱銘邀請出席飯局-首次與黎智英親身見面&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱獲李柱銘邀請出席飯局 首次與黎智英親身見面&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華上周提到他在2019年7月在中環文華東方酒店咖啡廳，與 Mark Simon 首次親身見面。陳今稱，該次會面之後，他在同月首次親身與黎智英見面。事前他獲李柱銘的邀請，「佢話有個 lunch appointment，會有黎智英，佢想我去參加，而嗰間餐廳係何俊仁細佬開嘅。」惟李柱銘並未有在通話中提及飯局的目的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳稱他有赴約，當他到達餐廳包廂時，黎智英基於保安理由而要求陳交出手機，然後有一名餐廳職員收起他的手機。「當我開始嘗試介紹自己嘅時候，好快就畀黎智英打斷咗，佢話唔使介紹喇，佢話『Mark Simon 已經話畀我聽』，佢已經係咁𠵱查過我。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳引述黎智英在飯局中的說話：「佢話如果我需要聯絡佢嘅話，可以透過 Mark Simon，因為 Mark Simon 會盡量協助同滿足我嘅訴求。」黎又指 Mark Simon 每日都會聯絡他，亦會向他匯報。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華黎智英稱勇武派令到個畫面唔靚失國際支持-冀聯絡他們籲克制&quot;&gt;陳梓華：黎智英稱「勇武派令到個畫面唔靚」、失國際支持 冀聯絡他們籲克制&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指：「佢（黎）特別要求我，睇吓可唔可以聯絡到一啲勇武派嘅領袖，因為呢啲勇武派令到個畫面唔靚。」陳表示，以他當時的理解，有一些勇武派在反修例運動入面，在街頭上作出破壞，例如縱火及破壞公共設施等，而黎智英認為「咁樣會失去國際支持，尤其係美國嘅支持」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指黎提出一個「淨化計劃」，「就係聯絡到呢啲勇武派嘅領袖，令到佢哋克制」，又稱「年青人做唔到嘅嘢，利用佢傳媒嘅力量，就可以做到」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指黎要求他提供勇武派領袖的聯絡方式，「然後睇吓大家可唔可以對話。」陳指，「因為當時佢（黎）相信，勇武派其實係有一個大台」，即是「一班示威者會聽從一小撮嘅人嘅指揮」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳解釋，當時在 Telegram 上有不同群組，而當中有部份群組是由勇武派開設的，所以黎智英相信陳可以聯絡到該些勇武派。陳當時回覆黎：「我會嘗試。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問李柱銘有否在飯局中發言。陳指李有說：「試吓啲刺身。」法官杜麗冰聞言笑指：「所以這間是日本餐廳。」陳確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指聯絡勇武派有困難-後來坦白告知黎智英無法聯絡&quot;&gt;陳梓華指聯絡勇武派有困難 後來坦白告知黎智英無法聯絡&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳其後再解釋，在 Telegram 群組入面，會有一些人自稱勇武派，同時有人自稱是做文宣的人，而勇武派會提出他們的主張，文宣人亦會提出他們的文宣、口號和關注點。在大多數情況之下，兩方的意見不會相反，因為「大家都係鬧緊政府」，但在一些極端情況發生時，「例如當時掟燃燒彈，但係掟咗落去自己人度，咁有啲和理非就會認為，如果係一啲和平嘅示威或者遊行，未必需要咁激進。但係有啲人就會覺得，唯有激進嘅手段，政府先會回應訴求。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳表示，他當時有嘗試去接觸勇武派，但是遇到困難，首先是「究竟我點樣去確定嗰個人係咪勇武」，第二是若然對方真的是勇武，「佢又點會同我講佢係勇武。」所以後來黎問陳有沒有可能聯絡到勇武派的時候，「我都坦白同佢講，我聯絡唔到。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指mark-simon贊助g20報紙展覽&quot;&gt;陳梓華指Mark Simon贊助G20報紙展覽&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳供稱，大約在2019年7月尾至8月的時候，Mark Simon 告知他，「佢同黎智英都想喺多個地方搞報紙展，咁就想我去搵嗰二十份報紙，佢有講到德國、紐約美國、台北。」就香港而言，陳亦協助舉辦了一個報紙展覽，並且墊支約3萬元，而 Mark Simon 表示願意贊助，後來便把相關款項歸還給他。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指展覽會展出G20登報行動的報紙，目的是「Echo 番我哋當時嘅訴求，啫係反修例同五大訴求，同埋爭取國際關注」。陳指該展覽於2019年7月底，在港島的一幢唐樓舉行，主要搞手還有李宇軒和另一名網友。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指g20和攬炒團隊合作辦第三次眾籌李宇軒是領袖之一&quot;&gt;陳梓華指G20和「攬炒團隊」合作辦第三次眾籌、李宇軒是領袖之一&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳供稱，直至2019年8月，第一次登報的G20團隊和第二次登報的「攬炒團隊」合作，籌辦了第三次眾籌和登報行動，「想要求國際關注香港警暴嘅情況，同埋呼籲國際停止出售武器畀香港警察。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又提到，G20團隊和「攬炒團隊」是次合作之後，就變成大家後來所知道的「Stand with Hong Kong（簡稱SWHK）」，所以 SWHK 的骨幹成員會由G20團隊和「攬炒團隊」的人去擔任，例如橫跨兩個團隊的李宇軒、「攬炒巴」劉祖廸，以及來自G20團隊的網民「家樂牌通心粉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指在第三次眾籌之中，李宇軒負責處理所有財政事務，「然後基本上佢就係G20加攬炒團隊嘅其中一個領袖，因為佢係好少數可以橫跨到兩個團隊嘅人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指李宇軒欲找他代問mark-simon借用戶口收取眾籌款項&quot;&gt;陳梓華指李宇軒欲找他代問Mark Simon借用戶口收取眾籌款項&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，李當時致電給他，指無法收取眾籌款項，陳在查問下才得知他們有第三次眾籌，之後李稱需要一個銀行戶口來收取款項。陳詢問為何不能用李自己的銀行戶口，李則回答「佢個團隊唔想筆錢流返嚟香港，所以最好係一個美國嘅戶口」。陳表示，雖然李宇軒當時沒有明說，「但係我知道佢想我去問 Mark Simon 去提供呢個戶口，所以我就打電話畀 Mark Simon。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳表示，據他當時所知，收取眾籌款項的過程「棘住咗喺程序上面」，眾籌平台「唔肯放筆錢，話要做 KYC（know your client）等等嘅情況」，他們想找一個人的銀行戶口來收取款項，於是 Mark Simon 便提供了他的戶口。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳稱，他當時致電 Mark Simon 講述眾籌主題和遇到的困難，對方一度問：「唔通佢哋冇其他途徑（支取眾籌款項）？」陳從李口中確認沒有其他途徑之後，便轉達給 Mark Simon，「然後 Mark Simon 就話好啦。」李其後傳送了電郵給陳，該電郵要求索取 Mark Simon 的銀行戶口及個人資料；陳把該電郵轉發給 Mark Simon，Mark Simon 回答問題之後，陳將 Mark Simon 的電郵轉發給李宇軒，要求二人直接聯絡，陳不知道後來事態發展如何。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;據陳所知，Mark Simon 幫忙接收眾籌款項，之後登報團隊成立了一個信託基金來保管該筆錢。對於信託基金誰人「話到事」，他當時理解李宇軒是其中之一，後來從李口中得知還有另一名叫「Surely」的網民，相信其真名是 Shirley Ho。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華mark-simon答應替第三次登報墊支-並建議增網上宣傳&quot;&gt;陳梓華：Mark Simon答應替第三次登報墊支 並建議增網上宣傳&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，陳指 Mark Simon 當時建議登報計劃可以增加網上宣傳，「佢話唔好再局限喺登實體嘅報紙，而係應該數碼化，應該喺網上做呢啲宣傳，同埋喺社交平台，佢有提到 Twitter。」陳又引述 Mark Simon 認為傳播度和受眾人數在網絡上是最多的，而非實體報紙。Mark Simon 亦有問他需否墊支，當時陳回答不需要，「但後來李宇軒又話需要。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;於是陳跟Mark Simon說李宇軒需要有人墊支，「Mark Simon 就話，咁上次嗰筆都未找，𠵱家又要再墊支」，因2019年6月G20峰會全球文宣登報計劃中，Mark Simon 及黎智英墊支了約150萬元。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳隨即致電李查問：「第一次眾籌筆數做乜仲未找？」但李說他肯定已經還款，所以陳才知道李是把款項還給 Chartwell Holding Limited 的戶口。陳遂向李說：「一開始佢哋話（墊支限額）500萬嘛，咁嗰500萬未到，咁仲有350萬，咁李宇軒就話OKOK。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳之後回電 Mark Simon，告知對方李已還錢，「Mark Simon 就話，（款項）原來唔係去咗加拿大嗰邊（戶口），佢就一路 check 住加拿大嗰邊。」陳指 Mark Simon 其後答應墊支，叫他傳送發票，好像G20登報那樣做法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華確認mark-simon及lais-hotel墊支六國報紙廣告費&quot;&gt;陳梓華確認Mark Simon及Lais Hotel墊支六國報紙廣告費&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示不同報館及媒體公司的電郵、發票和收據，就西班牙報紙《世界報》（El Mundo）的廣告費，匯款收據顯示 Lais Hotel Property Limited 在2019年8月16日支付了18,500歐元。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就《日經新聞》，發票顯示廣告費為2,040萬日圓（時值約147萬元）。陳指，當時登報團隊好想拿下8月19日的《日經新聞》廣告欄，當時「主要係『rip（李宇軒網名）』同我講，佢哋一定要攞到，咁但係又係 last minute」，於是陳聯絡 Mark Simon 從加拿大匯款。「但人哋日本人做嘢好嚴謹，你哋一定要畀咗錢先」，所以李宇軒便將147萬元的支票拿去《日經新聞》的辦公室，「佢當時話佢土下座咁囈（哀求）人哋」，希望對方先不要入該張支票，替他保留廣告版面，待對方收到加拿大的匯款之後便歸還該支票。但因為 Mark Simon 已經從加拿大匯款繳付廣告費，所以《日經新聞》一方同意，先收下李的支票，待他們收到 Mark Simon 的款項之後，便會退款給李。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;英國媒體公司所發出的發票顯示《旗幟晚報》（Evening Standard）、《泰晤士報》（The Times）、《衛報》（The Guardian）、英國《時代》雜誌（Time）、The Week、City A.M.和《經濟學人》（Economist UK），合共7份報紙和雜誌的廣告費用合共約12萬英鎊。控方又展示匯款紀錄，陳確認 Mark Simon 預先支付了相關費用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳另確認瑞典《每日工業報》（Dagens industri）、《每日新聞報》（Dagens Nyheter）、德國《法蘭克福匯報》（Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung）和南韓《京鄉新聞》的廣告費均由 Mark Simon 預先繳付，合共約65萬港元。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（15日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第60日審訊。陳梓華繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供，他提及於2019年8月的第三次眾籌登報行動之後，G20團隊及「攬炒團隊」討論去向問題，惟「當時有好大分歧」，部份人認為應籌辦下一次登報，部份人則認為應舉辦其他類型的活動。而李宇軒則不贊成繼續登報，更一度退出群組，後來眾人決定不登報，而堅持登報的人便退出群組，留下來的人就慢慢變為大家所知道的「Stand with Hong Kong」（重光團隊，簡稱 SWHK）。陳指經過上述分道揚鑣之後，SWHK 漸漸由李宇軒和「攬炒巴」劉祖廸等少數人主導，並掌控信託基金「Project Hong Kong Trust」。陳另提到，Mark Simon 曾建議在美國國會山莊租用商務辦公室，以舉辦關於香港的展覽，或者做游說中心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已認罪的被告陳梓華第二天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。由控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行作主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指李宇軒不同意繼續登報行動-曾提轉戰國際游說&quot;&gt;陳梓華指李宇軒不同意繼續登報行動 曾提轉戰國際游說&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華供稱，2019年8月，G20團隊和「攬炒團隊」合作籌辦第三次眾籌和登報行動，由於 Mark Simon 曾經提議增加網上宣傳，不應再局限於實體報紙登廣告，因此事後陳與李宇軒討論是否繼續做登報行動。陳引述李形容：「登報紙好似放煙花咁，頭一次好好睇好犀利，第二次都仲OK，但再做落去就冇意思喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳亦記得李提過「係咪要做多啲國際游說嘅工作」，但因為陳當時專注於報紙展覽，所以當時二人的討論沒有結論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指團隊內部對未來路線現分歧-最終決定不再登報&quot;&gt;陳梓華指團隊內部對未來路線現分歧 最終決定不再登報&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳提到，G20團隊及「攬炒團隊」亦有討論相關議題，惟「當時有好大分歧」。陳指，「其實當時呢，登報紙做得好好」，G20團隊包辦了眾籌、設計和排版工作，而「攬炒團隊」則根據地在英國，「當時俾到我嘅感覺係，佢哋想 ride on G20 有能力籌到錢同埋登報紙。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，第三次眾籌籌到約1,400萬元，差不多是原訂目標的兩倍，眾人考慮如何使用登報之後的700至800萬元餘款，「係咪全部攞晒嚟登報紙，定係好似 JD team（攬炒團隊）咁樣，可以做多啲唔同活動，例如請顧問公司呀，做啲集會呀，佢哋有好大嘅分歧。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指G20團隊以網名為「家樂牌通心粉」的成員為首；而李宇軒則代表「攬炒團隊」，「然後為咗唔再登報，佢就退出咗群組。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指：「佢（李）問我會唔會撐佢」，又指：「我當時畀佢拉咗入 group，跟住又 quit 咗 group，佢想畀到其他骨幹成員睇到，唔會再有一個 backer（墊支的人）喺個 group 入面。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳表示，後來「我靜靜雞入咗返G20嗰邊」，「後來演變到就係，大家決定唔再登報紙喇，然後想登報紙嘅人就全部走晒，就連本身G20個群組都冇埋。」陳續指，留下來的人就慢慢變為大家所知道的「Stand with Hong Kong」（重光團隊，簡稱SWHK）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指swhk骨幹成員包括李宇軒和攬炒巴&quot;&gt;陳梓華指SWHK骨幹成員包括李宇軒和「攬炒巴」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，「經過呢件事之後，成個 Stand with Hong Kong 就基本上係『rip（李宇軒）』，同埋少數人話事咁囉。」他表示以他所理解，SWHK 骨幹成員包括李宇軒、「攬炒巴」劉祖廸、「Madison」、「Surely」（真名 Shirley Ho）和「Always」。惟他從來都不在團隊決策層（board）入面，所以不知道實際上有什麼人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳提到，「攬炒團隊」的領袖固之然是「攬炒巴」劉祖廸，更重要的是其身邊有李宇軒、「Madison」和「Always」協助，所以他們的意見和立場基本上是一致。而「Surely」則原本是美國線的人，「但 Stand with Hong Kong 慢慢地由喺英國做好多嘢，到喺美國做好多嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，他在上午作供時提到的信託基金「Project Hong Kong Trust」都是由 SWHK 的骨幹成員所控制。因此第三次眾籌餘下的700至800萬元如何使用，「就基本上好睇佢哋同唔同意去做嗰啲嘢喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳另指，後來在2019年9月底至10月的時候，部份前G20團隊的人籌辦了另一次眾籌。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指swhk正名是重光團隊-但可與攬炒團隊互換&quot;&gt;陳梓華指SWHK正名是「重光團隊」 但可與「攬炒團隊」互換&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問到，換言之，SWHK 是否被「攬炒團隊」主導？陳確認是，也因此後來 SWHK 會以「攬炒團隊」作為中文名稱。不過 SWHK 內部對於中文名稱有爭議，有的人希望繼續使用「攬炒團隊」，但所有人都同意用「重光團隊」。陳指後來也沒有使用到「攬炒團隊」這稱呼，「因為後來攬炒巴同 Stand with Hong Kong 都有啲鬧翻。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後陳指，SWHK 的正名是「重光團隊」，所以之後的眾籌計劃名為「重光計劃」，但是有時視乎負責聲明或文宣的人是團隊內哪些人，有時「攬炒團隊」的人負責活動或文宣，他們便會使用「攬炒團隊」來稱呼 SWHK。至少在2020年8月，大家會依然使用「攬炒團隊」這稱呼，陳表示：「我個人會話呢個係 interchangeable 嘅 term 囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳重提上星期證供，指某個活動中會出現很多 Telegram 的小組，「但 Stand with Hong Kong 會以線、國家嚟分組」，所以在第一次的G20登報行動中，會遍及13個國家和20份報紙，但去到第三次眾籌登報時，便沒有再在意大利報紙登廣告，但是新增了芬蘭和丹麥的報紙，「因為攬炒巴想開拓呢條北歐戰線，慢慢發展落嚟，美國線和英國線就主導咗成個 Stand with Hong Kong，因為佢哋最多人同埋最多 resources。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指mark-simon提議租用美國國會山莊做香港展覽和游說中心&quot;&gt;陳梓華指Mark Simon提議租用美國國會山莊做香港展覽和游說中心&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華上午提到，黎智英和 Mark Simon 希望在不同地區舉辦報紙展覽。他下午供稱，Mark Simon 曾催促他盡快提供G20的報紙和文宣海報，讓 Mark Simon 能夠在美國舉辦展覽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，在2019年8月一次 WhatsApp call 之中，Mark Simon 曾提議他和李宇軒「不如會唔會喺 Capitol Hill（美國國會山莊）去租嗰啲好似商務辦公室咁，hold 一啲展覽，或者做游說中心」，並稱「give a taste of Hong Kong」。當陳將相這提議告知李宇軒時，李說：「一早有人講過。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問 Mark Simon 口中的「游說中心」是關於什麼。陳則指 Mark 只提及一句而已，「因為當時我冇興趣。」至於「展覽」，則是關於反修例運動，想告訴別人香港發生什麼事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問二人有否跟進 Mark Simon 的提議。陳表示：「我印象中冇」，不過李宇軒提及過類似的概念，「佢係想喺全球都有一個咁樣嘅 Hong Kong Centre，但都唔係一啲好認真嘅討論嚟。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指李宇軒每次最後一刻才要求幫手-使mark-simon不滿&quot;&gt;陳梓華指李宇軒每次最後一刻才要求幫手 使Mark Simon不滿&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，Mark Simon 向陳梓華和李宇軒二人提議，是否代表當時 Mark Simon 已經認識李宇軒。陳則指在第一次登報行動的時候，發票和單據上已經出現李宇軒的名字；後來陳和李簽訂借據，Mark Simon 查問詳情時，陳已經提及過李這個人。至於李宇軒與 Mark Simon 親身見面，則是2019年9月二人同場會見美國議員 Rick Scott 的時候。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳另提到：「Mark Simon 脾氣都⋯⋯比較 grumpy（脾氣不好）」，說罷不禁發笑，「所以每次李宇軒都 last minute 咁去要求幫手，其實 Mark Simon 都好唔鍾意，嗰時都會聽吓佢發吓牢騷、講吓李宇軒」，但是 Mark Simon 對於李的能力評價很高。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華舉辦不同街站和展覽-黎智英資助14萬元&quot;&gt;陳梓華舉辦不同街站和展覽 黎智英資助14萬元&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳供稱，他在2019年8月至10月頭持續舉辦街站和數個展覽，就G20的報紙展覽，「後來發現啲人根本唔識嗰啲語言，所以咁就冇意思」，於是他在街站展示多些別人製作的文宣，以及贊助更加多種類的文宣。他指街站和展覽的地點遍及大埔、深井、中環和台灣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到街站和展覽的活動經費是由誰人出資，陳指最後是 Mark Simon 把他曾墊支的款項歸還給他。控方遂展示陳的銀行戶口紀錄，顯示 Mark Simon 曾把3萬元存入陳的戶口；此外，另一張寫有黎智英名字的支票顯示，抬頭是陳梓華，金額為144,100港元。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;executive-summary&quot;&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF) currently performs a broad range of mission sets, with well-trained personnel who perform well when part of coalition operations. However, resources and personnel are spread very thinly across multiple small fleets with almost no capacity to absorb combat losses. Fleets also lack sufficient spares or ammunition stockpiles for sustained high-intensity operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since February 2022, collective defence and deterrence through NATO has become a more urgent planning concern than overseas crisis management and support to national civilian authorities. This is because the Netherlands faces a dangerous European security environment. Russian military output has increased rapidly, the situation on the ground in Ukraine is deteriorating, and the US is increasingly militarily overstretched and politically fractured. Presidential candidate Donald Trump has also openly questioned US resolve to defend Europe against future Russian aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For conventional deterrence, NATO depends on winning air superiority quickly. This enables relatively small but well-trained armies with close air support to conduct decisive manoeuvre warfare against Russian forces, while air forces conduct strikes on logistics, bases, command and control facilities, and other critical targets in depth. It is necessary because Russia’s ground forces can field far more land-based firepower and politically sustain much higher numbers of casualties for longer than European armies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Russia’s highly capable ground-based air defence system would deny air superiority unless NATO can rapidly locate, suppress and destroy Russian surface-to-air missile systems and radars at scale in the early weeks of any conflict. This task, known as suppression/destruction of enemy air defences (SEAD/DEAD), is the highest priority shortfall identified by NATO Air Command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, only the US could carry out effective SEAD/DEAD operations against Russian air defences in Europe. Other NATO air forces lack suitable munitions, aircraft and training in the specialised tactics required. Thus, Europe is dangerously exposed if the US is unable (or unwilling) to come to its defence at scale – a real risk if Russian aggression coincides with a US–China standoff or conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RNLAF should prioritise investment in its fighter force to help close this gap. The fighter force is the strongest comparative advantage that the Netherlands currently has. It is closer to being able to field credible SEAD/DEAD capabilities than any other European NATO air force, apart from potentially the Norwegian Air Force. The F-35A has the sensors and stealth capabilities required to conduct SEAD/DEAD effectively. The RNLAF also has excellent tactical DNA in terms of pilot training culture, aggressive operational mindset, familiarity with US tactics and a large fighter weapons instructor cadre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investment is needed to realise this potential. The RNLAF currently struggles to fly the F-35 enough to maintain the good tactical fundamentals inherited from the F-16 fighter force. It also lacks sufficient stocks of weapons, especially missiles suitable for conducting SEAD/DEAD against Russian forces. Therefore, the Netherlands should allocate additional personnel and funding towards improving RNLAF fighter force maintenance capacity, flying hours for training, and weapons acquisition, even if this requires significant cuts elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weapons acquisitions and training for the F-35 should be prioritised around SEAD/DEAD to enable RNLAF aircrew to become specialists in this critical role. Investment here could provide an outsized contribution to NATO and do more to improve European security through deterrence against Russia than any other comparable uplift across other parts of the Dutch armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a force with a strong culture of interoperability with allies, the RNLAF should be well placed to coordinate with close European allies to identify mission sets where multinational specialisation can be pursued in a complementary way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If significant additional funding were made available, the RNLAF could also afford to uplift other areas such as missile defence for both national and NATO tasks. The main long-range threat to the Netherlands from Russia is cruise missiles due to range constraints on Russian ballistic systems. The NASAMS air defence system is highly effective against cruise missiles and significantly cheaper than Patriot, so is likely a more efficient way to protect key national assets than Patriot, which should be allocated to NATO missions where possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another potentially very useful and efficient investment in the medium term would be to seek to acquire a small number of stealthy uncrewed ISR assets from the US in place of MQ-9 Reaper airframes, which are not suitable for operations in contested airspace. Penetrating ISR is one of the other key NATO bottlenecks where the only existing capability is American, and one where a small number of relatively efficient airframes could have an outsized effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, the Netherlands may choose to look to space assets for critical ISR in heavily contested airspace. Here again, however, the US provides the overwhelming bulk of NATO capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report was produced as the primary output of a study requested and funded by the Royal Netherlands Air Force. The request from the Royal Netherlands Air Force was for an independent assessment by RUSI of the current strengths and weaknesses of Dutch air and space power, and for recommendations for how to optimise its contribution to the Dutch Joint Force and to wider NATO deterrence and warfighting capabilities. As such, there was no consultation with the Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF) on the content of the report itself, and RUSI retained all editorial control and oversight throughout the writing and peer review process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary evidence on which the report is based is several weeks of intensive interviews conducted by the author on multiple visits to the Netherlands. Units and bases visited included: the Air Force Headquarters in Breda; fighter squadrons and Air Combat Command in Volkel and Leeuwarden; helicopter units and the Helicopter Warfare Centre in Gilze-Rijen; a range of planning staffs and subject matter experts from all three services at the Ministry of Defence in The Hague; and the Air Mobility Force in Eindhoven. These interviews involved commanders and senior officers, planners and operators of multiple ranks, as well as civilian subject matter experts from across the RNLAF alongside a smaller number of focused interviews with officers from the Royal Netherlands Army and Navy. For wider contextual awareness, the author also drew on research visits to frontline squadrons and interviews with commanders in the UK, Sweden, Finland, Norway, Italy, Germany, Canada and the US during 2023 and early 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conclusions are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of the Dutch armed forces nor the Ministry of Defence of the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-strategic-context-and-imperatives&quot;&gt;I. Strategic Context and Imperatives&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its 2022 Defence White Paper, the Netherlands committed to significant increases in defence spending, and to reinforcing and regenerating the operational capabilities of the armed forces. These ongoing reorganisation efforts have been prompted by a recognised need to respond to radical changes in the European security environment and the rising threat of a serious conflict directly involving NATO states in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine has resulted in two years of high-intensity warfare that shows no signs of abating. Ukraine has conducted a highly successful defensive war, but its summer counter-offensive in 2023 failed to achieve its objectives, according to Ukraine’s commander-in-chief General Valery Zaluzhny. In early 2024, Russia’s forces were increasingly better supplied with ammunition, new vehicles and weapons as a result of the Kremlin’s belated decision to mobilise the Russian economy for full-scale war production in late 2022. This trend looks set to increase, as Russia’s military budget for 2024 is a 68% increase over the already boosted amount that it spent in 2023, resulting in a projected spend of around 6.5% of GDP on the war effort. It has also diversified and increased its supply base by acquiring huge quantities of artillery and missile ammunition from Iran, North Korea, Belarus and Syria, including investing in new factories specifically to supply Russian contracts in those countries over the longer term. In other words, Russia has committed itself to fighting and winning a long war against Ukraine, and to long-term confrontation with the West, not simply at the political level but also increasingly through structural economic posture. At the same time, Western support to Ukraine is no longer being sustained at the level required for continued offensive progress. This is because NATO stockpiles have been badly depleted and sufficient European investment has not yet been made in defence industrial production capacity to match Russia’s preparations to fight and win a long war. Political splintering continues in the US, with support deliveries to Ukraine suspended due to a bitter impasse between the Republican and Democratic parties in Congress. Even more seriously, the re-election of Donald Trump in November 2024 is an entirely plausible prospect and could have dire implications for US support to not only Ukraine but also collective deterrence within NATO. In February 2024, Trump told a campaign rally in South Carolina that “if [a NATO country that had not spent 2% of GDP on defence] were attacked by Russia … no I would not protect you. In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if a more pro-NATO and pro-Ukrainian president is elected in November 2024, the US faces a major challenge from China that is leading to an ever-greater proportion of American military capability and logistical support capacity being focused on the Indo-Pacific theatre. The serious and growing degree of US military overstretch means that if there is a conflict or serious armed stand-off between China and the US in the Indo-Pacific in the coming years, there will be very little American capacity to send large-scale reinforcements, ammunition resupply and logistical support to help European NATO members against any concurrent Russian military aggression. With Russian industry now on a war footing, supported by Chinese components and Iranian and North Korean production capacity, it will only be a few years before the Kremlin could credibly embark on a wider conflict in Europe if the US military cannot come to the rescue. This threat, which many European countries are belatedly waking up to, is the reason why the Netherlands and many other countries are urgently seeking to rebuild the warfighting capacity of their armed forces. In its 2022 White Paper, the Dutch Ministry of Defence states: “Europe needs to become more self-reliant. The countries of Europe, including the Netherlands, must therefore become stronger together”. Unfortunately, European armed forces have shrunk to a shadow of their former selves under the weight of decades of successive budget cuts and the specific but limited requirements of small counterinsurgency wars overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operationally credible and resilient airpower is essential for rapidly renewing European capacity to deter and, if necessary, defeat Russian aggression against NATO. Russia’s primary conventional military strengths are its ability to mass artillery firepower, armoured vehicles, electronic warfare systems and air defence systems on land against a given axis of advance. It has shown itself capable of fighting long, grinding wars of attrition, despite early setbacks, if initial aggression is not decisively repulsed. Ukraine has also demonstrated that Russian forces have a far greater tolerance for major casualties than Western forces – allowing them to take risks and accept costs that most Western democracies would find unacceptable, without being deterred from continuing offensive operations. Consequently, recruiting demographics, political constraints around conscription in many countries and industrial production capacity mean it is unlikely that European countries could develop the capacity to reliably repel future Russian aggression on land without air superiority. The entire Western military system is predicated on achieving air superiority at the start of any war. ISR capabilities and the raw firepower of massed tactical airpower are what has repeatedly enabled highly trained but relatively small land forces to achieve the sort of rapid battlefield victories over state opponents that would be needed to decisively repulse Russian aggression against NATO forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia responded to the overwhelming battlefield success of this model, especially during the conventional phases of both Gulf Wars, by developing a very potent integrated air defence system (IADS) and electronic warfare capabilities to deny the West air superiority. The failure of the Russian VKS (Aerospace Forces) to achieve air superiority was critical to Russia’s failure to defeat Ukraine in 2022; in a future clash, European forces would be even more seriously handicapped by a similar failure against Russian forces due to having far less capacity to rely on massed firepower on land and lower casualty tolerance. Therefore, regenerating serious suppression and destruction of enemy air defences (SEAD/DEAD) capabilities among European NATO members is essential if the Alliance is to regain a viable joint warfighting credibility to deter and defeat future Russian aggression. Currently, almost all of NATO’s SEAD/DEAD capability is fielded by the US Air Force and US Navy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that the VKS has proven distinctly underwhelming in Ukraine, with far less tactical and operational proficiency and inferior technical capabilities in the air-to-air domain compared with the major NATO air forces. Therefore, even without major US force involvement, Europe’s air forces could likely deal with Russia’s tactical airpower relatively easily if the SEAD/DEAD mission could be accomplished as a prerequisite. Russia can field potent long-range strike capabilities with cruise and ballistic missiles. However, the size of the salvos it can launch is limited in practice by the limited number of strategic bombers, naval assets and ground-based Iskander-M launchers. Once actually used in anger, NATO forces would target these launch platforms as a priority – including on their bases with stand-off weapons – and so Russia’s ability to sustain a long-term precision strike campaign against countries outside rocket-artillery range would also probably be more limited than its missile arsenal and production capacity would suggest at face value. In the naval domain, Russia’s submarines are a potent force, but the bulk of its surface fleet is ageing and unlikely to be able to project power at any distance against NATO forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this means that the most vital challenge for European NATO members is to regenerate SEAD/DEAD capabilities sufficient to hunt down and destroy a majority of forward-deployed Russian ground-based surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems in the first week or two of any incursions onto Alliance territory. If that can be accomplished, the rest of the Russian conventional military would likely struggle to prevent NATO establishing air superiority over the contested area. Air superiority, once established, would enable the traditional large-scale use of conventional fourth-generation fast jets, attack helicopters and UAVs to deliver an overwhelming air campaign against Russian forces in the contested area in support of NATO land and naval forces. Many Alliance member states maintain sizeable fleets of fourth-generation fast jets such as the Eurofighter Typhoon, Rafale, Gripen, Mirage 2000 and F-16, and attack helicopters such as the AH-64 Apache and Eurocopter Tiger. Many also have stockpiles of short-ranged but affordable direct attack munitions such as laser- and GPS-guided bombs and anti-tank missiles sufficient to destroy hundreds of Russian vehicles if they could be delivered effectively. Following decades of counterinsurgency and overseas intervention operations, most are also highly experienced in delivering this sort of direct attack firepower efficiently and accurately in close coordination with friendly ground forces. In other words, massed European tactical airpower in conjunction with NATO ground forces could devastate Russian ground forces in an actual clash, but only if a successful SEAD/DEAD campaign could be undertaken against Russia’s SAM systems first to enable non-stealthy fast jets and attack helicopters to sustainably operate in the contested area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The critical nature of the need for SEAD/DEAD to make conventional deterrence credible against Russia is well understood within NATO. The current head of NATO’s Allied Air Command (AIRCOM) General James Hecker has repeatedly stated in public that “counter-anti-access/area denial mission is [the] number-one priority, throughout NATO on the air side”. The most likely scenario in which Russia might risk direct military action against the territory of a NATO member state to discredit Article V and collective deterrence is one in which the US is perceived as either unwilling or unable to come to Europe’s defence at scale. Therefore, to ensure deterrence in such a scenario, European NATO air forces must be able to collectively conduct effective SEAD/DEAD operations against Russian ground-based air defences and follow up with potent battlefield close air support and interdiction strikes at scale without major US help. If they had the capabilities to credibly do so, Russia would be much less likely to risk a ground incursion into NATO territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, the key question behind this report is what should the RNLAF do to maximise its relevance and credibility? The report focuses on this primarily through the lens of Dutch contributions to collective European defence because, as a small country, the Netherlands can only satisfactorily offset the growing threat from Russia collectively through NATO. The Dutch government recognised the critical nature of this task in signing the Vilnius Summit Communiqué in July 2023, which pledged to make the new NATO defence plans “the main driver for the organisation of our [national] forces and the specific military requirements NATO asks of them”. In view of this, this report focuses primarily on how the RNLAF can maximise the value it adds to Alliance deterrence and warfighting capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-current-dutch-air-and-space-power-strengths-and-weaknesses&quot;&gt;II. Current Dutch Air and Space Power Strengths and Weaknesses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many decades, the RNLAF has operated as a capable and well-respected small to medium-sized air force. It has primarily maintained its technological edge by purchasing aircraft, weapons and other key equipment off-the-shelf from the US, most notably its long-serving F-16 and new F-35 multi-role fighter fleets, along with CH-47 Chinook and AH-64 Apache heavy lift and attack helicopters. There are some exceptions, including medium helicopters, where the RNLAF operates the AS532 Cougar made by Airbus, primarily for missions alongside the army’s Air Mobile Brigade, and the NHIndustries NH90 in the maritime helicopter role for the navy. The RNLAF also jointly operates the Airbus A330 MRTT (multi-role tanker transport) as part of the Multinational MRTT Unit (MMU) and has ordered the Brazilian-made C-390 tactical transport aircraft to replace its four ageing C-130H-30 Hercules tactical transport aircraft. For combat aircraft, however, the RNLAF operates US types and has also generally sought to maintain commonality with US-operated versions of its platforms, relying on the US for software, sensor and weapons upgrades. The general policy of remaining in lockstep with US domestic upgrade programmes has allowed the Netherlands to benefit from consistent US investment in iterative capability development, which is on a different scale from other Western countries due to vast disparities in funding. As a result, RNLAF aircraft and weapons have remained relatively up to date throughout their service lives, with comparatively minimal investment required beyond normal foreign military sales acquisition and operating costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar vein, the RNLAF has maintained a consistent approach of maximising interoperability with the US Air Force through alignment and integration of training, doctrine, and tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs). Dutch aircrew and maintainers for the F-16 and the F-35 are trained at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona, and RNLAF fighter force doctrine and TTPs are based on the US Air Force’s Fighter Integration 3-1 standard. This ensures that they are generally able to integrate seamlessly into complex air operations (COMAOs) led by the US, alongside other NATO members. The RNLAF has long prioritised this seamless interoperability as a policy position – aiming to specialise as a “plug-in” air force for any US-led coalition due to common aircraft, TTPs, doctrine, weapons and training. In recent years, reliance on the US aircrew training pipeline and common doctrine has ensured that, despite difficulties with F-35 availability and flying hours in the Netherlands itself, new pilots are arriving from the “B-Course” at Luke Air Force Base sufficiently well trained to be close to combat-ready wingmen, and only requiring a small amount of supplementary training to reach that level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downside to this approach is that the RNLAF is structurally and institutionally limited to being a tactical rather than an operational or strategic force. Training and recent operational experience have been geared around plugging into coalition air campaigns with a multinational air tasking order (ATO) produced and run by combined air operations centres in Uedem in Germany, Torrejón in Spain or Al Udeid in Qatar. These centres are staffed by thousands of American and NATO staff officers, including Dutch personnel, who have long been active and internationally valued participants. However, the lack of national operational-and strategic-level capacity does mean that the RNLAF, like most European air forces, is currently extremely dependent on the US for operational-level planning, targeting and command and control (C2) in order to perform effective combat operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key component of this dependency is in the vital but often overlooked area of targeting, for which the RNLAF uses standardised NATO doctrine, systems and procedures. Targeting is the process by which higher-level commanders’ aims are fused with intelligence and surveillance data about hostile activity in an area of operations to analyse potential targets in terms of importance and priority, and ultimately allocate weapons and aircraft sorties to attack them. In recent years, the RNLAF has made significant progress in generating a national capability to conduct what is known as advanced target development (ATD), which is a comparatively granular and late-stage part of the overall process. This means that the Netherlands now has a national capability to derive the extremely precise (Category 1) target location and elevation coordinates to enable the accurate delivery of standard precision-guided weapons. ATD also involves calculating the appropriate weapon(s) required to provide the necessary effects on targets and the optimal delivery profiles for a strike (weaponeering), and conducting collateral damage estimation and mitigation analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is no Dutch national intermediate target development (ITD) capability at present. This is the process prior to ATD through which intelligence and surveillance information on potential target points are combined and analysed. The aim of ITD is to produce target packs containing information such as relevant use by hostile forces, importance to wider campaign objectives, vulnerabilities, defences, and ultimately weighting that helps determine whether the target is a priority or not. This is vital to be able to develop a joint priority target list and then further refine that into an ATO, where targets and weapons are allocated to aircraft sorties and associated enablers like tankers are coordinated to ultimately deliver the strikes. This is a dependency shared by the majority of European air forces, exacerbated by widespread personnel shortages in key intelligence and staff officer trades, to which the RNLAF is not immune, having around a 20% deficit compared to its authorised personnel strength among most trades. What this means in practice is that the RNLAF would struggle to generate and execute a national air campaign, except one that relied solely on dynamic targeting at the discretion of aircrew against pre-authorised targets of opportunity. However, the RNLAF ATD cell represents a useful contribution to NATO air campaign planning and ATO production during ongoing operations, and one that is currently relatively unusual among comparably sized air forces in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In overall force structure terms, the RNLAF is essentially a broad but fragile structure that is heavily dependent on US support in terms of planning, C2 enablement, ammunition resupply, logistical support, tanker support and training capacity. The fighter fleet is far smaller than at any period in RNLAF history, and while it has a varied and relatively large rotary wing inventory for its size, the inventory of each individual type within the helicopter force is still very small. The RNLAF participates in shared multinational strategic airlift, airborne early warning and control systems (AWACS) and aerial refuelling forces via NATO, but has no ability to task these assets nationally. It has also acquired four MQ-9 Reaper armed unmanned aircraft, has plans to acquire four more primarily for naval support operations, and has a new satellite for initial R&amp;amp;D as part of nascent efforts to field space-based surveillance and monitoring capabilities with other European allies. The RNLAF also provides personnel for the Patriot air defence system that is operated by the Dutch army. Across a force of only 6,400 regular forces, 1,100 civilian workers and 750 reservists, and after decades of ever-shrinking budgets, maintaining this broad spread of capabilities has inevitably resulted in a force that is spread exceptionally thinly. There is no capacity to absorb significant combat losses, a very limited ability to plan operations or conduct detailed targeting at a national level, and Dutch forces have inadequate ammunition, spare parts, logistical support, missile defence cover, force protection capacity and training in key missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the Dutch Ministry of Defence is to achieve its goals of rejuvenating the capacity of air and space power to play a meaningful role in the defence of the Netherlands and other NATO allies against Russia, it must be allowed to make major changes quickly and with a ruthless focus on the primary threat. In the absence of a transformative increase in defence spending, the RNLAF will need to choose certain key mission sets to invest in at the expense of cuts elsewhere. Such choices must be made in close coordination with other European allies to ensure that NATO’s collective defence capabilities are balanced and operationally credible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;fighter-force&quot;&gt;Fighter Force&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A notable current strength of the RNLAF compared with most other European air forces is that it has so far maintained a very high average experience level among its frontline aircrew. The RNLAF places a disproportionately heavy emphasis on weapons instructor training compared with most NATO air forces, with 5–10 crews going through the RNLAF Weapons School every year. The school also trains weapons instructors across a wide range of role specialisation, including intelligence officers, MIM-104 Patriot air defence system operators, helicopter aircrew and air battle managers. This means that most RNLAF fighter squadrons currently have 2–3 fighter weapons instructors (FWIs) tasked specifically with optimising and delivering tactical training for other pilots, and many senior squadron, operations group and wing commanders at each base are also FWIs. For comparison, most RAF squadrons have a single equivalent qualified weapons instructor (QWI) performing the role, and even most US Air Force squadrons have a single dedicated “patch”, although in both cases one or two others still often remain part of the squadron or parent wing in other senior roles. This means that most Dutch FWIs are significantly less overworked than those in most NATO air forces, where burnout among weapons instructors is a significant retention issue for these key personnel. However, the resources required to maintain such a high output of FWIs in a comparatively small force constitute a significant drain in terms of instructor time, programmatic capacity and flying hours, resulting in a trade-off being consciously made to spend less of these resources on regular squadron personnel training. Nevertheless, the trade-off seems to be a good one, since the tactical DNA of the RNLAF fighter (and attack helicopter) aircrew communities is demonstrably excellent. Core skills and procedures are consistently performed to a high standard and are comparable to those found in the US Air Force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many RNLAF fighter squadrons also have a high average level of overall pilot flying experience well in excess of 1,000 hours, which is also unusual in most NATO air forces. This unusually high experience level within the Dutch aircrew cadre is partly due to deliberate RNLAF HR policies which avoid incentivising pilots to take staff jobs for career progression until they have spent at least two three-year flying tours as Majors. Pilots, and also to a lesser extent intelligence personnel and air battle managers, also usually spend most of their careers until at least the rank of Major at the same base they were assigned to when they first completed basic training. This ensures a high degree of continuity that enhances on-the-job training and forges strong bonds and working relationships between different trades working at each location. However, it also reduces the flexibility of the RNLAF in terms of its ability to rapidly move people around between postings and bases to compensate for unexpected gaps or demand signals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another contributing factor for specifically high average aircrew experience levels is a legacy of decades of relatively high annual flying hour totals on F-16 squadrons. Although this figure has declined significantly over the past 15 years, the remaining F-16 operator, 312 Squadron, maintained rates of between 160 and 200 flying hours per year in its final six months of operations before shutting down to convert to the F-35. However, the squadrons that have already converted to the F-35 have been flying far fewer hours, and well below NATO targets, at least when operating from their home bases. This means that as older, more experienced pilots retire or move to staff jobs, the new generation is not replacing them with nearly as much “banked” experience, and so the force is losing “crew-room experience” increasingly rapidly. Synthetic training in the simulator is a critical component of training for all F-35 operators, especially for high-threat missions where realistic tactics and threats cannot be easily or securely practised live in most training airspace. Tactics and emergency procedures can be practised efficiently in the simulator, and the Dutch training syllabus is predicated on a 60/40 live/synthetic flying training mix. However, there are core piloting, “G-fitness”, task and risk management skills, especially when operating close to limits in demanding mission sets, that can only be maintained by regular live flying. The serious decline in flying hours during the transition to the F-35 has had significant negative impacts on pilot morale, retention and mission readiness and skills, and has a number of contributing causes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the availability issues are caused by difficulties that essentially amount to growing pains. First and foremost is the comparative lack of experience among maintenance personnel with the F-35 compared to the F-16, which the RNLAF has operated for almost 40 years. This not only results in comparable tasks often taking longer with the F-35 due to simple lack of familiarity, but also more seriously a lack of confidence among more senior maintenance personnel to judge potential impact or risk from comparatively minor issues or superficial damage to components. Consequently, there is a tendency to err on the side of caution and mandate corrective or preventative maintenance rather than certify a jet as airworthy/mission ready for minor issues with the F-35, whereas on the F-16 maintenance supervisors would have had sufficient experience and therefore confidence to “own the risk” of signing off on a sortie regardless. These issues are improving over time, but have a particularly heavy impact on squadrons in the initial few years of F-35 conversion and operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another contributing difficulty has been the fact that the RNLAF has had to maintain full F-16 operational capability during the transition, rather than retiring the F-16 fleet once some of the F-35 order had arrived in country and concentrating all available fighter force resources on the F-35. This decision was made with the full knowledge that it would create significant challenges, due to the F-16’s nuclear dual-capable aircraft (DCA) role as part of the NATO Nuclear Sharing Arrangement. Because this is a NATO mission that the Netherlands performs alongside four other countries, the RNLAF determined that it had to maintain the F-16 DCA force until the nascent F-35 force had been established and trained to a sufficiently mature degree to take over the DCA role. The coming stand down of 312 Squadron as the final Dutch F-16 unit by October 2024, however, will free up significant additional maintenance capacity and funding for the F-35 fleet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frequent delays in receiving the spare parts required for maintenance tasks and overhauls have also contributed to limiting RNLAF F-35 availability and, therefore, flying hours. There is a limit to the degree that the RNLAF can improve this issue itself, since, unlike most aircraft, it is generally not possible for F-35 users to pay more money to purchase larger national stockpiles of spares. Instead, the F-35 is part of a global user supply chain, in which parts are stored in depots around the world and are shipped to units according to when the predictive maintenance system forecasts that they will be needed – at least in theory. In practice, there have been significant shortages and delays throughout the global F-35 logistics network, meaning that aircraft have frequently been grounded for extended periods of time waiting for critical parts to be delivered. The US and Lockheed Martin have publicly committed to focusing on improving the spare parts supply situation for global users and significant improvement has been seen at the squadron level in the past 18 months. However, since the start of 2024, progress has been interrupted by a major uptick in the requirements of other F-35 partner nations for spares resupply for ongoing combat operations in the Middle East, which has had a noticeable effect on spares delivery delay rates for non-deployed units elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, when the RNLAF F-35 force has deployed on operations in Eastern Europe or to Norway, aircraft availability and flying output has consistently spiked due to receiving priority for spares resupply as a “deployed unit”, and given greater maintenance crew output when on operations overseas compared to at home. For the foreseeable future, however, a shortage of global spare parts remains one of the constraints for RNLAF F-35 availability when operating from home base, and one over which Dutch decision-makers have limited control. There is also a serious question around the impact on RNLAF spares resupply in the event of a major war – especially a concurrent Europe/Indo-Pacific crisis scenario – in which the US and many other F-35 operators globally will all suddenly need to fly combat operations at a far greater scale than usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RNLAF also currently does not have air-to-ground weapons that are suitable for high-intensity conflict in significant numbers beyond the GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) glide weapon that provides a limited degree of stand-off strike capability against fixed targets from F-16s or F-35s. Even against fixed targets, the accuracy of the GBU-39 risks being significantly degraded in GPS-denied environments, which Russia has proven very capable of creating using electronic warfare effects in Ukraine and Kaliningrad. Efforts are underway in the Netherlands to acquire stand-off cruise missiles in the form of air-launched Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles, Extended Range (JASSM-ER) for the F-35 force and Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles (TLAM) for Navy frigates and submarines. These, however, are expensive weapons that cannot be purchased in large quantities, making them best suited to attacking strategic or high-value fixed targets. The only dedicated weapon so far on order for SEAD/DEAD is the AGM-88G Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile, Extended Range (AARGM-ER) for internal carriage on F-35s. This will provide a significant capability to suppress and potentially also physically destroy modern ground-based air defence radars, but delivery in quantity is unlikely before the late 2020s due to demand for the weapon from the US and other export customers, such as Australia, Norway and Finland, significantly outstripping available stocks and immediate production capacity in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;fighter-force-recommendations&quot;&gt;Fighter Force Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A core recommendation of this report is that the Netherlands significantly increases the priority given to its fighter force as an overall component of its military air and space power, if necessary at the expense of uncomfortable force reductions elsewhere. The RNLAF is closer than almost any other non-US NATO air force to being able to field the kind of operationally credible SEAD/DEAD capabilities that are currently the most critical bottleneck in Alliance deterrence and warfighting capacity. The pilot training and squadron culture within the RNLAF fighter force, with a heavy emphasis on producing and maintaining a solid core of FWIs, means the competency and cultural building blocks are in place to produce world-class SEAD/DEAD F-35 crews capable of operating against the highest end threats that Russia fields. However, this will only be possible if the force is able to direct a much greater proportion of its available live flying and simulated flying time specifically to this mission set and if appropriate specialised weapons are purchased in significant quantities. The Netherlands now has the second-largest operational F-35 fleet in Europe; one that continues to grow thanks to the funded ambitions for a third operational squadron. Since the RNLAF did not defer F-35 acquisitions, as many NATO air forces did in past years due to in-year budgetary pressures, its planned fleet of 52 should be fully delivered by 2026, with options for six additional aircraft being explored. With two squadrons already operational, there is a lot of latent capability already in place which could be rapidly unlocked, as opposed to the outlook for many NATO F-35 customers who will be waiting several years for most of their aircraft deliveries and who will take years after that learning to maintain, operate and exploit its capabilities effectively. There are three key policy changes that could dramatically increase the RNLAF’s F-35 force capability and value for NATO in the short term:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RNLAF operational training should be more focused, with prioritisation of the crucial SEAD/DEAD and offensive counter air (OCA) mission sets at the expense of close air support (CAS) in permissive environments, and tactical intercept (TI) missions. The RNLAF has a limited ability to increase live flying hours beyond a certain point within the constraints of the global F-35 spare parts supply chain and maintenance personnel numbers. Therefore, it is vital that RNLAF F-35 crews are allowed to focus the training time they do have on becoming highly capable at the most critical mission sets that most other NATO air forces cannot do, rather than trying to be at best adequate across the wide range of missions that the aircraft is technically capable of. The risk in terms of loss of CAS and TI capacity in the RNLAF F-35 force could be offset by greater strategic and operational integration with and reliance on nearby allies with much larger fourth-generation fast jet fleets such as Germany, France and Sweden. These air forces in turn could benefit from the RNLAF being much more capable in the key SEAD/DEAD mission since they and European NATO more widely lack the capacity to perform this key mission effectively. In other words, the RNLAF should pursue mission specialisation for the fighter force as part of a multinational European task-sharing approach to meeting NATO defence plan requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additional funding should be urgently allocated to increase maintenance capacity for F-35 squadrons in terms of both uniformed maintainers and civilian contracted support. As already discussed, there are limitations in the Netherlands’ ability to purchase additional stockpiles of spare parts due to the way the global supply chain construct works for the F-35. However, additional maintenance personnel capacity on squadron would still significantly increase aircraft availability in many situations, and thus improve pilot flying hours, mission readiness, morale and retention. The more that the force can fly, the more combat power it represents and the greater return that the Netherlands and NATO as a whole get from the acquisition of these expensive aircraft. Operating them on a lean support budget is a false economy in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The RNLAF should increase the money allocated to urgently increasing weapon stockpile levels for key munitions in the OCA/DEAD mission sets for the F-35 force. Weapons deliveries and integration take years, so rapid orders are essential if the force is to be enabled in time to meet even a medium-term threat. Large orders are also publicly visible signals of intent to adversaries and allies alike due to foreign military scales and governmental oversight requirements, so they may positively affect deterrence calculations even before delivery. One option that might be worth exploring to help get around production bottlenecks in US-made weapons like AARGM-ER would be a rapid joint order of MBDA’s SPEAR 3 miniature DEAD cruise missile with the UK. A joint order would enable a reduction in per-weapon unit costs for both countries and potentially increase the priority allocated to the integration of SPEAR 3 into F-35 software update tranches by the US Joint Programme Office, allowing the weapon to be used on the frontline more quickly. Perhaps more importantly, a SPEAR 3 order would provide some potential redundancy against the risk that deliveries of AARGM-ER are delayed beyond the currently envisaged timelines due to US production being allocated to other customers as a result of unforeseen crises in the interim – something that has previously happened with US deliveries of spare parts and weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;air-and-missile-defence&quot;&gt;Air and Missile Defence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the two Dutch NASAMS batteries and three Patriot batteries are generally allocated to defending Dutch army formations on notional forward deployments, with the latter more conceptually focused on static defence in forward or domestic positions. There are ongoing policy debates between the armed services as to what assets should receive priority for limited defensive coverage capacity and also how often Dutch Patriot batteries should be temporarily allocated to NATO for use at SACEUR’s discretion to provide wider Alliance integrated air and missile defence capacity. Some favour static defence of key civilian infrastructure such as port facilities, cities and power stations, while others favour defence of key military bases and many with the army place greater conceptual priority on providing defensive cover to forward-deployed ground formations. There is certainly nowhere near enough capacity to meet all the competing demands, and allocation of missile defence capability in most countries historically tends to be driven by political demands rather than military advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current plans include an ongoing one-for-one replacement of the two remaining legacy NASAMS batteries with NASAMS II – an improved version with greater range using the AMRAAM-ER missile, the option to use cheaper AIM-9X missiles for short-range engagements, and improved datalink connectivity to allow it to share situational awareness across other parts of the force. There is also discussion of purchasing two additional NASAMS II batteries as part of increased national defence spending plans, which in theory would allow greater flexibility to both provide protection to key RNLAF bases while still providing cover to army formations when forward deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To increase the credibility of Dutch air power, especially the F-35 force as a potentially critical component of European NATO warfighting and deterrence capabilities, provision of at least limited air and missile defence coverage at the main fighter bases could have an outsized effect. The author’s recommendation is that the Netherlands integrated air and missile defence (IAMD) capacity should be prioritised towards maximising the deterrent effect that the joint force can have against Russian aggression rather than trying to reduce the damage to civilian targets in a war should deterrence fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A war between Russia and NATO is unlikely to start with massed missile strikes on European cities or other critical civilian infrastructure because such attacks would be directly counterproductive to Russia’s interest in preventing a unified, rapid and unambiguous political and military response by the whole Alliance to an Article V invocation. Instead, Russia would more likely try to use the threat of missile strikes on key military bases and command facilities lacking adequate IAMD coverage in order to deter key NATO countries from using military forces in the defence of an Eastern ally. Thus, the requirement for IAMD does not need to be to defend the whole of the Netherlands from the entire Russian missile arsenal – a plainly impossible task. Rather, it only needs to be sufficient to make key Dutch military bases and command facilities difficult enough targets to ensure that the Netherlands could not be easily deterred from using its military forces by the threat of a limited number of Russian missile strikes. Such strikes would necessarily be limited because in such a scenario Russia would have to threaten multiple European countries simultaneously to try to deter the Alliance as a whole from coming to the defence of a member state – thus reducing the number of missiles from its finite salvo capacity that it could use against any one country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian ballistic missile launch options are also limited for targets in the Netherlands itself due to the range from Russian territory being too great for Russian ground-based Iskander-M or older Tochka-U systems. Furthermore, once active hostilities broke out the airspace over the Baltic Sea would rapidly become prohibitively dangerous for crewed Russian Mig-31K, Su-34 or Tu-22M3 aircraft attempting to reach suitable launch altitudes and speeds to fire Kh-47M2 “Kinzhal” aero-ballistic missiles due to numerous NATO defensive combat air patrols by multiple Baltic-adjacent countries. The primary missile threat to the Netherlands, therefore, would come from air-launched Kh-101 and Kh-555 and naval 3M14 cruise missiles fired from the Arctic, where the bombers and submarines launching them would be relatively safe from interception. This would give significant warning time from other allies such as the UK and Norway as the missiles would need to travel several thousand kilometres at subsonic speeds before reaching the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the RNLAF develops the F-35 force to be a core component of European SEAD/DEAD capability, then the bases from which it operates would likely become a higher priority target for any threatened or actual Russian missile attack. Fortunately, NASAMS has already proven highly effective at intercepting even the most capable Russian cruise missiles in Ukraine, with a very high probability of kill per interceptor launched, allowing a single launcher and radar to destroy multiple incoming missiles from large salvoes arriving near-simultaneously at low altitudes. Thus, even a small NASAMS II battery with a single radar and a few launchers at both Volkel and Leeuwarden air bases would greatly increase the number of missiles that Russian targeteers would have to allocate from their limited salvo capacity to guarantee successful hits on any given target point on each base. RNLAF bases already feature significant numbers of Cold War-vintage hardened aircraft shelters, and there are more in a disused state that could be reactivated with limited investment, meaning that even successful precision hits would only destroy a single aircraft at most. Dispersal and hardening of spare parts storage and mission planning facilities on the bases could also significantly reduce vulnerability to Russian strikes. Consequently, if deployed as part of a coherent plan to harden the bases themselves, even minimally sized NASAMS defences could make RNLAF air bases very unattractive targets for the limited salvo weight Russia would be able to count on launching at the outset of a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the RNLAF enables its F-35 force to perform the critical SEAD/DEAD mission effectively, it should be allocated high priority for NASAMS cover against Russian cruise missile strikes that might otherwise deter its use in a crisis or, worse, destroy it on the ground. The small size of the Royal Netherlands Army compared to Polish, Finnish or German counterparts also means that providing Patriot cover to national forces in a forward-deployed posture in Eastern Europe would likely have a limited effect on Russia’s calculations of European ability and willingness to fight a successful defensive war. The traditional Cold War task of defending major ports to allow large-scale US forces to arrive is also potentially less relevant in a context where the most likely scenario in which Russia might risk war with NATO is if the US is unable or unwilling to reinforce Europe at scale. In comparison, Dutch Patriot batteries could have a significantly greater deterrence-enhancing effect if assigned to SACEUR’s control in any conflict, where they would almost certainly be used to increase the defensive cover around NATO command centres and logistics hubs that are vital for all Alliance member states’ ability to coordinate and control operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;helicopter-fleets&quot;&gt;Helicopter Fleets&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Netherlands has a significantly larger helicopter capacity than most comparably sized European air forces. This is for two primary reasons. First, because the army is currently organised around an air manoeuvre brigade alongside its armoured brigade. The air manoeuvre brigade conceptually and doctrinally depends on being inserted, resupplied, supported and, if necessary, extracted by composite squadrons of CH-47 Chinook heavy lift helicopters and AH-64 Apache helicopter gunships. Second, because the Netherlands – like many other NATO member states – has largely deployed its armed forces for counterinsurgency and overseas counterterrorism operations since the end of the Cold War. In these discretionary wars, where domestic political tolerance for friendly casualties was extremely low, and special forces operations played an outsized role, the most critical need for air capabilities was for specialised helicopter fleets to conduct rapid battlefield casualty evacuation, move small forces around large areas of security responsibility, and perform discreet insertion operations. The consequence was a major rebalancing of the RNLAF over time away from the Cold War focus on maintaining a large fighter fleet ready for high-intensity peer warfighting to building up helicopter and fixed-wing mobility fleets that were in heavy demand for those conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ongoing war in Ukraine has illustrated that helicopters and fixed-wing mobility fleets can still be useful in high-intensity wars. The most important role they have played for the Ukrainian armed forces is rapidly transporting scarce anti-tank teams, man-portable air defence systems (MANPADS) teams, commanders and electronic warfare equipment to where they are needed most while staying behind the frontlines. However, when flown in frontline fire support, insertion or evacuation roles, both sides’ mobility and attack helicopters have suffered heavy losses. When helicopters have been used for penetrating operations beyond the frontlines, loss rates have been unsustainable, especially among assault forces on landing zones due to artillery fire, and among helicopters when ambushed by air defence assets during the return leg of penetrating sorties. This has led both sides to rapidly become more cautious with transport helicopters and to largely use attack helicopters for safer but inaccurate suppressive rocket barrage attacks from behind the lines. The exception is Russia’s successful employment of Ka-52 and Mi-28 attack helicopters with anti-tank guided missiles in a reactive, defensive role to contain Ukrainian penetrations of Russian frontlines with armoured vehicles during the unsuccessful 2023 summer offensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that is clear from Ukraine is that helicopter operations will be seriously constrained close to the frontlines in any conflict against Russian forces by the layered threat of long-, medium- and short-ranged ground-based SAM systems, fighter patrols with long-range air-to-air missiles like the R-37M, and ground forces with large quantities of MANPADS and short-ranged anti-aircraft and counter-UAV systems. Consequently, traditional helicopter assault operations by air manoeuvre forces to seize objectives beyond enemy frontlines at scale appear highly unlikely to succeed or even be attempted in a NATO/Russia context. Even if assault forces could be successfully inserted onto an objective without prohibitive losses on route, they would likely suffer major casualties from Russian artillery on their drop zone and be impossible to resupply or extract once the element of surprise was lost. In any case, RNLAF helicopter lift capacity is not sufficient to insert the air manoeuvre brigade in a single lift, resulting in the need for repeated insertion waves to make the air assault concept work as traditionally envisaged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conceptually, there is a debate within the army and the RNLAF helicopter force about the continued relevance of the air manoeuvre brigade concept for a NATO/Russia-centric primary defence task. Even advocates largely accept that the concept has to evolve away from air assault towards air mobility, with a much greater emphasis on moving light infantry into advantageous positions quickly either before active hostilities break out or behind/in the flanks of the main frontline areas. A policy recognition that air mobility and other warfighting tasks are not likely to involve crossing the frontlines en masse would, at least, reduce the mission-specific training and penetration aid requirements for the RNLAF’s Chinook force. It would also help free up capacity in the new AH-64E Apache fleet whose training focus is currently dominated by integrated operations with small formations, providing company- – or at most battalion level – CAS for the air manoeuvre brigade. The viability or lack thereof for traditional air assault operations in a NATO context matters as it is a very expensive capability to maintain and prevents personnel and resources being allocated to other priorities. Unpredictable deployment locations and high-readiness requirements mean that the Tier 1 composite helicopter squadron supporting the air manoeuvre brigade imposes more burdens on the RNLAF’s combat service support and combat support functions than F-35 deployments, which are generally to Allied air bases where partners also operate the aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many within the army are advocating for the purchase of several dozen Leopard 2 main battle tanks and a refocusing of the army’s warfighting output towards a heavy armoured brigade to fight as part of a German-led division in Eastern Europe. The Apache force has not traditionally been seen as a core part of the Dutch armoured brigade concept, and so the Army focusing on regenerating an armoured capability in this fashion at the expense of the post-Cold War emphasis on the air manoeuvre brigade should reduce systemic demand for integral Apache fire support at the tactical level. Instead, for example, the Apache force could train and practise deployments as a self-contained manoeuvre formation to rapidly deploy as a defensive anti-tank capability to bolster multinational NATO ground forces if a Russian attack was feared imminent. Russia’s success with significantly less capable Ka-52 and Mi-28 gunships against Ukrainian breakthrough attempts in summer 2023 suggests that if used defensively, forward-deployed RNLAF Apaches could play a valuable role containing breakthroughs by Russian armoured thrusts against NATO defence lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Netherlands also operates 19 relatively modern NH90 multirole medium helicopters from naval vessels. The NH90 has matured significantly following a difficult introduction into service around 10 years ago, but now provides good anti-submarine warfare capabilities, forward sensor options and ship-to-shore connector capacity from an expensive but relatively reliable airframe. Since these helicopters are central to the function of multiple weapons systems and mission capabilities of the navy’s frigates and support ships – especially anti-submarine warfare – they will need to continue to operate as they currently do regardless of other prioritisation decisions in the air and space power domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming a relatively continuous demand signal from the Dutch special operations forces (SOF), the 14 new H225M Caracal medium helicopters that have been purchased to replace the 12 AS532 Cougars are also likely to remain a requirement. However, the requirement for helicopter support capacity might be reduced if Dutch SOF capacity and training were to be refocused towards more covert collection and sabotage operations against Russian forces in Eastern Europe as opposed to counterinsurgency, stabilisation and partner force capacity-building deployments in the Middle East and Africa. Equally, however, the Ministry of Defence might choose to counterbalance an increasing focus on conventional deterrence in Europe by the regular Dutch armed forces by increasing SOF focus on out-of-area operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;fixed-wing-mobility-and-isr&quot;&gt;Fixed-Wing Mobility and ISR&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of fixed-wing mobility fleets, the RNLAF’s room to manoeuvre is limited as most of the major capability decisions have already been made. An ambition to replace the KC-10 tankers with two A-330 MRTTs morphed into Dutch participation in the multinational MRTT fleet, with the Netherlands contributing the crews, funding and support equivalence of two of the 10 that it operates. This model is significantly more cost efficient compared to multiple small national tanker fleets, but also limits the RNLAF’s ability to task them for national requirements, since the entire fleet comes under European Air Transport Command. The same goes for the Netherlands’ longstanding participation and deputy leadership of the NATO E-3A AWACS force, which is tasked by AIRCOM. Equally, the Netherlands can nominally draw on 500 hours of C-17 heavy lift capacity per year in return for the funding and personnel that it contributes to the multinational Heavy Airlift Wing based in Hungary, but does not have sole control of any one of the three aircraft. Thus, the RNLAF currently contributes slightly more to European collective fixed-wing aerial refuelling, AWACS and heavy lift capacity than it could afford to if it deployed national capabilities in these areas, but cannot easily or reliably task these assets in a crisis to support an RNLAF air operation without the agreement of other partner nations. This complicates operational defence planning since partner nations might have different political responses to the initial phases of Russian aggression and/or might also be competing for limited enabler capacity from these multinational fleets to support their own combat air contributions. It is particularly concerning for aerial refuelling tankers, where the Alliance faces a major deficit against requirements, such that pooled fleet capacity is constantly being requested well beyond its ability to support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RNLAF is directly replacing its C-130H Hercules tactical transport fleet with four new Embraer C-390s, which should provide a similar lift capacity with higher transit speed and lower operating costs. However, the mobility force as a whole is currently both overtasked and struggling with a lack of policy direction on what the primary requirements are from the rest of the joint force in a NATO/defence of the Netherlands context. This makes it hard for its leadership to plan for an optimal configuration of fixed-wing mobility force capacity in a Russia-dominated threat environment. One option might be to order some of the C-390s fitted with the new L3Harris/Embraer “Agile Tanker” boom refuelling kit that is being developed to provide additional tanker capacity for the RNLAF fighter force. While a KC-390 would lack the capacity and range of the much larger A-330 MRTT, it could operate from smaller, more austere bases and provide additional refuelling capacity for national RNLAF fighter operations in Europe. Furthermore, it would provide a tanker option for any possible F-35 deployments required to reinforce the Dutch overseas territories of Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten, which are not covered by NATO’s collective defence agreements. However, unlike a podded probe-and-drogue refuelling kit for cargo aircraft like the C-390 and C-130, the boom refuelling conversion required to make a KC-390 able to refuel the RNLAF’s F-35As would likely entail major structural changes and the deletion of the rear ramp, which would prevent such modified aircraft from being used in the regular tactical transport role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RNLAF has also purchased four MQ-9 Reaper remotely piloted aircraft that are capable of conducting persistent ISTAR missions in permissive airspace, and can be armed with laser-guided bombs and Hellfire missiles. It has successfully trialled Reapers in the maritime support role in the Dutch Caribbean alongside the navy. The trials suggest that their potential surface search and surveillance capabilities would make them very useful in counter-smuggling and counter-piracy patrols in combination with surface vessels. Therefore, the navy has strongly supported a planned acquisition of an additional four MQ-9 airframes equipped with specialised communications relay pods and maritime radar pods for this role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the MQ-9 is a relatively expensive capability to run, despite its efficient airframe, due to the very large volume of ISR data that it produces and its long endurance. It requires a three-person crew to fly it remotely, with new crew shifts for every eight hours of flight, alongside remote physical launch, recovery, maintenance and servicing teams, and a large staff of intelligence personnel to conduct processing, exploitation and distribution of the data that it collects while in flight. This ironically makes the uncrewed MQ-9 more personnel intensive to operate than most crewed platforms, especially in overstretched intelligence analysis and communications specialisms. It is also not suitable for operations within range of modern air defence systems, due to a relatively large radar cross section, slow cruise speed, and its lack of agility and self-defence capabilities. This makes it unsuitable as a supporting ISTAR or CAS asset against Russian forces in a NATO context. Even in the period leading up to a conflict, it cannot be flown in regular civilian-controlled airspace, meaning that temporary corridors and military training airspace must be used to operate over European territory – limiting operational flexibility and responsiveness. Furthermore, the Netherlands’ strict interpretation of EU privacy laws imposes significant constraints on using the MQ-9 for training with ISR sensors over the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In view of the many competing demands for funding and scarce intelligence and support personnel across the RNLAF, the author recommends that the MQ-9 fleet be curtailed at four aircraft, but that the planned maritime search radar and communications relay pods be purchased and fitted to the existing four instead. This would provide the capacity for an MQ-9 orbit to support either maritime security operations in the Caribbean or provide efficient ISR and CAS capacity at a small scale to overseas operations in permissive airspace. While it would represent a loss in capacity in both mission sets, it would free up funding and more importantly personnel capacity for higher-priority warfighting tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hypothetically, however, if a penetrating ISTAR capability were made available to purchase from the US – currently the only NATO operator of such capabilities – this would make an ideal replacement for the entire currently planned MQ-9s. A stealthy, uncrewed ISTAR platform would help fill a major European capability gap against Russian forces and would be extremely useful for SEAD/DEAD operations and deep strike targeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;space-capabilities&quot;&gt;Space Capabilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RNLAF currently lacks national operational space assets, and as such is entirely dependent on NATO allies to provide vital space-based enablers such as satellite communications, precision navigation and timing information through GPS and orbital imagery and signals/electronic intelligence services. Most of these capabilities are provided by the US. The RNLAF space department is currently trying to use NATO regional plans and AIRCOM priorities to assess what the space capability requirements are across the joint force. In other words, the priority for the RNLAF space team is currently gap analysis of national and NATO space capabilities other than US ones. This is an essential first step before coherent requirements can be written.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost and scope of most military space capabilities means that it goes without saying that the Netherlands cannot develop or field them alone. However, questions remain over which capabilities should be developed with NATO allies in multinational programmes, whether national development in some areas is required to gain access to suitable partner programmes, and what capabilities could be safely relied on as a service from commercial space providers. As part of this effort, the Netherlands has developed and launched an R&amp;amp;D electronic support measures payload into orbit, with plans underway to continue collaborative testing with a second and third payload with Norway in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear that Dutch air power, as well as most of the rest of the joint force, especially the navy for communications support, has a very deep degree of operational dependency on the US and to some extent other NATO allies for critical space capabilities. However, it is difficult to see how even significant increases in investment in space capabilities within the RNLAF’s potential budget could meaningfully change that situation in any relevant timeframe. Therefore, continued reliance on NATO allies and small-scale participation where appropriate in collaborative European capability development programmes seems like the most pragmatic course of action. Understanding and mapping the areas of dependency is nevertheless critical for planning and risk management, so the current efforts to do so in the RNLAF should continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;noise&quot;&gt;Noise&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High noise restrictions at all main operating bases in the Netherlands are worth mentioning as they directly impose major restrictions on flexible flying schedules and training for all RNLAF flying units. The political culture of the Netherlands places emphasis on public dialogue and consensus building. This means that noise complaints from residents in the vicinity of air bases – a common friction for almost all European air forces – has led to multiple rounds of noise restrictions being imposed on the RNLAF in the name of compromise. Over time, this has driven a steady ratcheting up of noise-restriction-related operational limitations, to the point that pilot and unit training requirements frequently cannot be met as flying is curtailed due to insufficient quotas of allowable take-offs and landings from their base. It is an indictment of the Dutch political system that when RNLAF fighters deploy to partner bases elsewhere in Europe, such as to Norway or Eastern Europe, their ability to fly and train rises significantly despite the added logistical pressures of temporary basing overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The noise restrictions have also almost totally negated a potentially major strong point of the Netherlands as a contributor to NATO air power credibility and resilience. Due to major force structure cuts since the end of the Cold War, the RNLAF has multiple air bases with significant excess capacity to temporarily host Allied units, including a large number of active and mothballed hardened aircraft shelters that provide good protection from missile and drone attacks. Key partners such as the US Air Force and the RAF are actively looking for suitable European bases to conduct regular short-term deployments as part of the Agile Combat Employment (ACE) concept, which aims to complicate Russian targeting by moving combat power more frequently than Russian targeting can match. In many ways, RNLAF bases such as Leeuwarden, Gilze-Rijen and Volkel are ideal ACE locations, since they are within range of the same North Sea training airspace used by squadrons based in the UK and have excellent facilities. However, the Netherlands’ NATO partners cannot use them as temporary deployment or training locations, as was done constantly during the Cold War, because this would use up noise quotas for take-offs and landings that are already insufficient for the Dutch units based there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These noise restrictions have been steadily imposed despite the fact that the RNLAF has fewer than half the aircraft and squadrons that it had in the 1990s and flies fewer hours per aircraft, so at each stage the actual levels of local noise were already lower than they had ever been. Such measures might have been understandable in an era when major military threats to European peace and security were considered a thing of the past but are manifestly inappropriate given the threats that the RNLAF now has to prepare to defend against.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The defence of the Netherlands, including its overseas territories in the Caribbean, and contributing to collective defence as part of NATO are the RNLAF’s first tasks. Compared with its traditional post-Cold War role of contributing technically capable but small and tactically focused force packages in US-led out-of-area operations, the task of ensuring deterrence against Russian aggression in Europe without major US support is far more challenging but also far more important. Support to out-of-area operations and to civil resilience and disaster relief in the Netherlands in peacetime are also important, but do not carry nearly the same stakes as a potential failure of collective defence in Europe against Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its current form, the RNLAF is not well prepared for serious warfighting. Its mix of aircraft types, ground-based air defence assets and space capabilities are so broad that each capability is too small and lacks adequate stockpiles of ammunition, spare parts or reserves to replace losses in serious combat. Even with significantly increased funding announced in 2022, the Netherlands faces serious limitations in terms of demographics and programmatic capacity that limit the extent to which it can grow its overall force structure. Therefore, the only way to significantly increase the capability and operational credibility of Dutch forces in a relevant timeframe is to take hard choices to cut significant areas of capability to free up personnel, programmatic capacity and money to rebuild stockpiles, resilience and operational expertise in high-end missions in other areas. This is not a new idea. The 2022 Defence White Paper specifically stated that the Ministry of Defence of the Netherlands is committed to a path of driving an increase in specialisation among European countries:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Defence organisation has decided to make additional investments in those capabilities and qualities that our armed forces excel at and that add the most value to collective operations with our allies and partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, simply adding to existing capabilities while trying to preserve all air and space force elements cannot generate the required uplifts to rebuild serious combat capabilities. Therefore, the key question is what components of air and space power do the Netherlands armed forces excel at, and which would add the most value to collective NATO defence capabilities?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary aim of NATO policy in Europe must be to rapidly field sufficiently capable conventional forces to convince Russia’s leaders that they could not achieve a rapid seizure of NATO territory even if the US is unable or politically unwilling to provide rapid reinforcements. The invasion of Ukraine in 2022 was based on the Kremlin’s assumptions that regime change in Kyiv would be achieved quickly and with only a short period of active high-intensity fighting. History offers few examples of countries embarking on aggression where they think the resulting conflict will be long and painful, but plenty of examples of wars that have continued for years and caused vast damage before either an armistice is reached or one side is victorious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia is well aware of the devastating capabilities of Western tactical airpower and consequently has prioritised the development of a highly capable IADS and electronic warfare capabilities to deny traditional Western aircraft and enablers access to the skies over any contested territory. Thus, if European NATO members can regenerate the credible capability to rapidly locate, suppress and destroy the few hundred SAM systems and key radar sites that Russia relies on for its military effectiveness against Western forces, it is highly unlikely that Moscow would risk territorial aggression against a member state. The risk would simply be too high that European NATO members would respond with a SEAD/DEAD campaign that would rapidly expose Russian forces to devastating conventional air attacks in support of the land and maritime battles. Conversely, without such credible SEAD/DEAD capabilities, it is difficult to see how European armies could field and sustain sufficiently large land forces quickly enough to beat the Russians at their own game without air superiority. European political will to suffer the kind of casualties that such fighting would entail is also open to question and a strategy that relied on doing so might invite Russia to believe it could attack an Eastern ally without facing a unified defensive reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, the RNLAF has a potentially key role to play in European defence and deterrence. While there are many small to medium air forces in NATO, none can currently field credible SEAD/DEAD capabilities – leaving the Alliance totally dependent on the US for this key mission. SEAD/DEAD requires not only aircraft that can get close enough to hostile SAMs within a layered Russian IADS and perform effective weapon deliveries but also ones that can do so with a specialised sensor suite that allows them to rapidly and precisely locate and classify SAMs when they turn on their engagement radars. The F-35 was purpose designed for this role and the Netherlands already operates one of the largest fleets in Europe. Simply having a capable multirole aircraft does not translate to effective SEAD/DEAD capabilities without the appropriate weapons and regular focused training for aircrew, planners and C2 structures. On the aircrew front, the Netherlands is also closer than most countries in Europe to being able to meet the requirement. The RNLAF has one of the most tactically proficient and culturally aggressive aircrew cadres in Europe, who have maintained near-parity and total interoperability with US warfighting tactics and standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, because of limited F-35 flying hours, aircrew are currently unable to maintain the required high levels of tactical proficiency in SEAD/DEAD alongside the host of other multirole missions that they are trained and deployed to perform. If tasked with prioritising training for SEAD/DEAD, they could rapidly become highly tactically proficient at the mission set, despite available flying hours falling well below their planned levels. Given its comparative advantages in F-35 numbers, pilot culture and training mindset, the RNLAF should prioritise SEAD/DEAD as the primary mission for its fighter force. It should accept risk against other mission sets in terms of training time, weapons procurement and operational deployments, relying on close European allies to undertake a greater share of less demanding defensive counter-air, tactical intercept and CAS missions with their larger fleets of fourth-generation fast jets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure maximum benefit from such mission specialisation, the RNLAF should also prioritise increasing the maintenance support provision, targeting cell capacity and force protection assets for the F-35 squadrons, even though that would mean reducing support to other force elements. In terms of planning and targeting procedures, a greater reliance on developing lists of pre-authorised air defence targets of opportunity and training to dynamically find and attack them could also reduce reliance on the relatively slow targeting process within the NATO 72-hour ATO cycle. It would also reduce the seriousness of current reliance on the US for ISTAR and targeting capacity to some extent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A political decision to relax some of the noise-related flying restrictions at RNLAF bases, which are far more restrictive than in other NATO countries, would also significantly improve the RNLAF aircrew’s ability to train effectively and to cooperate more closely with key Allied air forces. It would cost nothing in financial terms, and beyond having significant operational benefits would also be a useful demonstrative measure to show the Dutch public, NATO allies and Russia that the Netherlands is responding in concrete terms to the rapidly degrading security environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of weapons, additional redundancy and capacity in SEAD/DEAD – relevant capabilities should be prioritised. Options including the GBU-53/B Stormbreaker glide bomb and MBDA SPEAR 3 miniature cruise missile. Significant orders of these weapons would add depth to Dutch warfighting stocks and help mitigate the risk of delivery delays for the AGM-88G AARGM-ER that has already been ordered. There is also a strong argument for prioritising the allocation of limited NASAMS II batteries to protect the main F-35 bases from Russian cruise missile strikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An additional priority would be the acquisition of a penetrating, survivable ISTAR capability to provide NATO forces with a non-US ability to detect, classify and designate high-value mobile targets inside Russian air defence system coverage. If such a capability could be acquired, it should be prioritised over the acquisition of MQ-9 Reaper, which is an efficient and useful ISTAR and strike platform, but only in permissive airspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the uncertainty over the future utility and role of the air manoeuvre brigade, and the army’s desire to refocus on armoured warfare as part of a German-led division, reductions in helicopter capability could be justified if they enabled serious increases in fighter force SEAD/DEAD munitions stocks, aircraft maintenance and training quality. Assuming the Apache force is retained, it might be of most value to the Alliance and the Netherlands as a self-contained defensive anti-tank blunting force to defend forward-deployed Allied forces against Russian armour breakthroughs in the early phases of a conflict before Russian air defences can be attritted to a point where fixed-wing CAS can be employed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prioritisation means cuts to a broad force structure to enable specialisation, in addition to increased overall investment. Only then can warfighting stocks, readiness and deterrence be rebuilt. A loss of capacity in secondary out-of-area counter-smuggling and counterterrorism missions is unlikely to have any potentially existential implications for deterrence or defence capabilities for the Netherlands and NATO. The inability to conduct SEAD/DEAD without the US does have such existential implications, and the RNLAF is closer than any other European air force to being able to do so effectively, if it can be properly resourced and focused. Therefore, it should prioritise this mission, enabling and defending the fighter force, and the enabling functions that allow it to be delivered. In so doing, the Netherlands could rapidly field a critical capability to address the most serious bottleneck in European defensive options against Russian aggression. This would represent perhaps the most efficient possible allocation of limited national resources from a self-defence and NATO deterrence perspective. It would also make the Netherlands an indispensable framework nation in any European military response to Russian aggression. Consequently, investing in credible SEAD/DEAD capability through the F-35 force could provide the Netherlands with outsized political influence in a way that no other potentially affordable conventional capability could achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（12日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第59日審訊。控方傳召另一名已認罪被告陳梓華以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。陳供稱，2019年6月G20峰會全球文宣登報計劃面對資金問題，在「公海群組」成員的提議下，陳經民主黨創黨主席李柱銘聯絡黎智英，希望黎可以借貸。在李的協助下，陳聯絡上黎的私人助手 Mark Simon，對方表示「呢個計劃好符合佢哋個政治主張」，希望可以令政府回應市民訴求，遂願意墊支500萬元，但事後一定要還款。Mark Simon 又稱黎智英「會願意提供 all kinds of help 去支持呢類型嘅文宣活動」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「十二港人」之一李宇軒昨日完成了15日的作供，控方今傳召另一名已認罪被告陳梓華，以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華出庭作供-學歷至碩士程度-任職律師樓&quot;&gt;陳梓華出庭作供 學歷至碩士程度 任職律師樓&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳身穿灰色西裝、戴眼鏡，在3名懲教人員帶領下，循法庭特別通道進入庭內證人台就坐，並以非宗教儀式宣誓，其後開始作供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳供稱他的英文名是 Wayland，大學時修讀法律，碩士課程則修讀中國法律，主要收入來源是在律師樓工作的薪金。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳亦確認，他在2020年8月10日被警方以「協助罪犯」罪名拘捕，之後獲警方擔保。陳在2021年2月15日再次被捕，罪名是「勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全」。至同年2月17日，陳被正式起訴「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全罪」，被指與黎智英、Mark Simon 及「攬炒巴」劉祖廸等人串謀呼籲外國機構制裁香港特區及中國，另被控「串謀協助罪犯」。陳確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，陳在2021年7月7日承認「勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全」罪，而「串謀協助罪犯」罪則留法庭存檔，不予起訴。陳確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指冀透過g20登報關注反修例運動-惟出現資金問題&quot;&gt;陳梓華指冀透過G20登報關注反修例運動 惟出現資金問題&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就2019年的事件，控方問陳是否認識黎智英，陳表示：「我認識。」他並稱在2019年6月透過李柱銘聯絡黎智英。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，當時他在一個關於G20峰會的 Telegram「公海群組」，見到一個叫「rip」的用戶聲稱需要資金去做全球文宣登報，然後陳私訊「rip」了解情況，「rip」便直接打電話給陳，「我聽到把聲係男聲」，因而知道對方是一名男性。陳指「rip」當時解釋，雖然眾籌已經達標，但是他無法立即取得該筆眾籌款項。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就G20登報計劃，陳指「佢係一個全球登報嘅一個計劃，趁住當時G20個峰會，就希望可以表達到當時反修例運動，同埋關注香港嘅情況」，又指「當時亦都想表達到，暫緩呢個逃犯修訂條例，唔等如撤回」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指後來知道用戶rip真實身份是李宇軒&quot;&gt;陳梓華指後來知道用戶「rip」真實身份是李宇軒&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又提到他的 Telegram 用戶名稱是「T」，但一開始是使用「蜂蜜T奶」這名字。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「rip」，陳表示起初不知道這用戶的真實身份，直至大約2019年7月，他與「rip」簽過一份類似借據的協議，期間看過「rip」的身份證，所以知道他的身份是李宇軒。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指公海群組有人提議經李柱銘聯絡黎智英-以解決資金問題&quot;&gt;陳梓華指「公海群組」有人提議經李柱銘聯絡黎智英 以解決資金問題&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，當時「公海群組」有過千或過萬人，其中有一個叫「Uncle Walkie」的用戶提議可以聯絡黎智英或其朋友去解決資金問題。陳看到訊息後，在群組入面問：「咁有冇人認識黎智英？」然後有人提議，如果沒有人認識黎的話，可以聯絡李柱銘，「因為眾所周知，佢兩個關係好好。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，他便在群組中問：「咁有冇人識李柱銘呀？」然後有人把李柱銘的電話號碼傳送至群組。「當我見到個電話號碼，我以為嗰個人係搞笑，因為個電話號碼好特別，有六個字係一模一樣，然後我就大膽打電話過去，然後聯絡到李柱銘。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳稱，在電話中「我話我冒眛唐突咁打擾你，但係呢當時有一個G20嘅全球文宣登報計劃，個宗旨係想喺G20峰會度，表達到香港人嘅訴求」，但是眾籌計劃在程序上面，無法直接取得該筆款項，「所以我哋冇辦法按照當時所想嘅去俾到錢報章，去 hold 住啲版位，我哋需要一筆 bridge loan。」陳亦在電話中提及需要金額為300萬元，並稱這筆貸款一定會還，所以想看看李柱銘能否幫忙聯絡黎智英。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/YO6VGMz.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 李柱銘（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳憶述當時李柱銘在電話中表示明白，「但係我𠵱家唔得閒，我晏少少打返電話畀你。」後來李回電，要求陳再一次解釋為何需要貸款，因為按照李的理解，既然眾籌已經達標，理論上可以做到他們想做的事；陳遂向李解釋，「的而且確眾籌達標，但係眾籌平台 Gogetfund hold 住嗰筆錢，未能夠馬上就俾到我哋。」陳指李聽罷表示明白，「佢話佢會聯絡黎智英。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指李柱銘其後回電，指中「黎智英已經知道呢件事喇，但係佢唔喺香港，所以我可以搵佢個助手 Mark Simon，直接同 Mark Simon 對話。」陳引述李指：「但係初步聽落去，黎智英係 OK 呢件事（借貸）。」李傳送了 Mark Simon 的電話號碼給陳，之後陳「幾乎馬上」聯絡 Mark Simon。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華引述黎智英助手mark-simon稱g20登報計劃符合其政治主張-故會聯絡老闆&quot;&gt;陳梓華引述黎智英助手Mark Simon稱G20登報計劃符合其政治主張 故會聯絡老闆&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指聯絡到 Mark Simon 之後，「我將我哋遇到嘅困難去話俾佢聽，然後我哋需要呢個 bridge loan 去完成 G20 之前可以登到報紙。」陳轉述 Mark Simon 指，他大概知道這件事情，而陳並非第一個就此事聯絡他的人，「但我表達得比較清楚，所以佢願意同我合作。」陳又引述 Mark Simon 的說話：「佢話呢個計劃好符合佢哋個政治主張，佢都希望呢個計劃可以令政府回應市民訴求」，他聲稱會「同佢老細聯絡」，惟 Mark Simon 並沒未有在該次通話中提及其政治主張是什麼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，相隔10至15分鐘之後，Mark Simon 再次來電，「佢話呢個 bridge loan 冇問題，佢願意墊支500萬，但係要還。」陳理解當時 Mark Simon 所指的500萬元是限額，不能再多。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華mark-simon稱黎智英會願意提供任何形式協助&quot;&gt;陳梓華：Mark Simon稱黎智英會願意提供任何形式協助&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，Mark Simon 有否在電話中提及其老闆。陳則指：「當時佢話 Jimmy 會願意提供 all kinds of help 去支持呢類型嘅文宣活動。」而以陳所理解，Jimmy 即是黎智英。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳亦引述 Mark Simon 說：「呢一筆錢唔可以經我哋任何人手，佢希望個方式係，當啲報章去出一個invoice 嘅時候，然後佢去直接付款畀呢啲報章。」Mark Simon 又說，如果他們想在《蘋果》旗下報章登廣告的話，「係可以先行登報，然後再付款。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華告知李宇軒資金問題解決-並承諾若有需要可以再聯絡黎智英同mark-simon&quot;&gt;陳梓華告知李宇軒資金問題解決 並承諾若有需要「可以再聯絡黎智英同Mark Simon」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，他與 Mark Simon 通話之後，同日便透過 Telegram 聯絡李宇軒，告知「蘋果黎智英嗰邊願意墊支500萬」，並叫李將報館的廣告費發票電郵給他們「找數」。陳形容李「當初一開始唔相信呢件事，然後我再同佢講，我好確定我哋可以做到」，他並向李表示「若然你之後喺文宣國際線上面需要幫忙嘅話，我可以再聯絡黎智英同 Mark Simon」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，李聽罷之後，「佢當時好興奮，話要搞咗啲報紙先，然後就大家開始處理喺邊啲地區國家登報紙。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，為何陳當時特別聯絡網名「rip」的李宇軒，而不是其他人。陳表示，因為見到「rip」有權限把訊息置頂，因此相信「rip」當時是「群主」。加上當時他較早前就財務事宜聯絡過「rip」，相信「rip」負責財政，所以才會聯絡「rip」而不是其他人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指李宇軒在登報計劃中是資助者及協調者&quot;&gt;陳梓華指李宇軒在登報計劃中是資助者及協調者&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就陳梓華在登報計劃之中的角色，陳稱自己負責協調報館發票和收據的往來，就《衛報》、《華盛頓郵報》、兩間法國報紙及一份意大利報紙，李宇軒會將發票電郵給他，他會將之轉發給 Mark Simon，其後當 Mark Simon 繳付款項之後，就會將收據傳送給陳，然後陳轉發給李。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於其他報紙的發票和收據，陳並沒有收到，他當時知道李宇軒會收到所有報館的發票，而李會繳付廣告費。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就李宇軒的角色，陳表示以他的認知，李在「高登」或「連登」討論區得知G20全球登報計劃，當李參與眾籌計劃時，李負責選擇使用哪一個眾籌平台，然後將收款人設定為自己；當他們確定在哪些報紙登報的時候，李便用自己的錢繳付廣告費。因此陳認為李的角色除了是一個資助者（funder）之外，還是一個匯總、協調者，「去將唔同報章嘅內容，最尾擺埋一齊。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;兩公司墊支部份廣告費-mark-simon事後提供還款戶口資料-稱都係屬於佢老細&quot;&gt;兩公司墊支部份廣告費 Mark Simon事後提供還款戶口資料 稱都係「屬於佢老細」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方在庭上展示不同報館的發票和匯款紀錄，顯示《華盛頓郵報》的廣告費用是85,050美元，由 Lais Hotel Property Limited 代表李宇軒繳付。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;《衛報》發出的收據顯示 Lais Hotel Property Limited 代表李宇軒支付了18,000英鎊廣告費。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就意大利《晚郵報》（Corriere Della Sera）的廣告費，匯豐銀行的付款紀錄顯示，力高顧問有限公司（Dico Consultants Limited）代表李宇軒支付2萬元歐羅。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問陳，當時 Mark Simon 有否提及 Lais Hotel Property Limited 和力高顧問有限公司的事。陳則回答當時沒有，但之後在2019年7月，第一次與 Mark Simon 見面的時候，對方則有提及。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就歸還墊支款項事宜，陳指他在2019年7月與 Mark Simon 見面時，從對方手上接過單據和3個用以還款的戶口資料，然後轉交給李宇軒。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指3個戶口分別是加拿大、香港和台灣的戶口，當時 Mark Simon 跟他說：「希望、如果可以，可以 send 返啲錢去加拿大，但若然方便你哋，你哋揀任何一個戶口都可以，因為3個戶口都係屬於佢老細。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（12日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第59日審訊。控方傳召另一名已認罪被告陳梓華以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。陳供稱，在2019年6月籌辦G20峰會全球文宣登報計劃期間，他與李宇軒首次親身見面，他問李為何願意墊支400萬元，李當時回應：「為咗香港，都一定要咁做，就算按咗層樓，佢都會咁做。」同年7月，陳與 Mark Simon 首次親身見面，對方「大讚」登報文宣，表示非常滿意成果和效果。Mark Simon 又提議舉辦展覽以延續G20登報的影響力，若果符合他與黎智英的政治理念，「佢哋願意提供經濟上、人脈上，同埋傳媒方面嘅協助。」Mark Simon 亦提到「國際上面嘅 lobbying」，惟陳「當時對 lobbying 冇乜認知」，所以僅向對方說會嘗試參與報紙展覽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「十二港人」之一李宇軒昨日完成了15日的作供，控方今傳召另一名已認罪被告陳梓華，以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華問李宇軒為何墊支巨額-李稱為咗香港都一定要咁做&quot;&gt;陳梓華問李宇軒為何墊支巨額 李稱「為咗香港，都一定要咁做」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華上午提到，2019年6月G20峰會全球文宣登報計劃遇到資金問題，故他嘗試經李柱銘聯絡黎智英，後來聯絡上黎的私人助手 Mark Simon。Mark Simon 稱他及黎願意墊支500萬元，惟事後須要還款。最終 Mark Simon 及黎一方墊支了約150萬元，其餘廣告費則由李宇軒墊支。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;有關陳梓華與李宇軒第一次見面，陳指在籌辦G20登報期間，即2019年6月25至29日之間，二人在金鐘親身見面，「嗰次係純粹大家見個面，我問佢點解要佢自己墊支嗰筆錢」，因為據陳所知，李差不多要墊支400萬元，然後黎智英一方要墊支約200萬元，但是李當時回應：「為咗香港，都一定要咁做，就算按咗層樓，佢都會咁做。」此外，陳確認在該次見面中，有把一些匯款通知書交給李。惟陳當時並未知道李宇軒的真名。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華g20後詢問李宇軒還款安排惟李唔應機-遂要求簽借據&quot;&gt;陳梓華：G20後詢問李宇軒還款安排惟李「唔應機」 遂要求簽借據&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，G20登報計劃在13個國家、20份報紙刊登廣告之後，他便開始問李宇軒是否已經成功收到眾籌款項，「但佢一直都唔應機，於是乎我就喺群組入面問咗幾個網友點算。」陳指其中一個網友提議陳和李之間簽署借據，「令佢（李）個人承擔返嗰150萬元。」陳表示：「我認為呢種做法，係無論對 Mark Simon 定黎智英，定抑或係G20本身，都係負責任嘅做法。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，他準備好借據之後便打電話給李宇軒，打了數次後李才接電話，他向李解釋情況，「因為阿 Mark 都話有人問過嗰筆錢幾時會返番去、有冇時間表，但李宇軒乜都冇覆。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;於是陳相約李到金鐘力寶中心見面，並在哪裡與李共同簽署一份借據。陳指同場有兩名見證人，皆是群組入面的網友，而簽署好的借據由兩名見證人保管。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指借據上並沒有規定還款日期，只是提及李宇軒向代表 Mark Simon 的陳梓華借錢，欠款約150萬元。該次是陳和李第二次見面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指李宇軒獲得還款戶口號碼後-便稱已還款-不需利息&quot;&gt;陳梓華指李宇軒獲得還款戶口號碼後 便稱已還款 不需利息&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，在簽署借據當日的晚上，他與 Mark Simon 透過 WhatsApp call 通話，陳向對方稱，「李宇軒係願意個人去承擔呢筆債務，所以佢唔會拖數。」陳又解釋，因為 Mark Simon 提供了3個還款戶口，分別是加拿大、台灣和香港的戶口，所以李不知道如何還錢，究竟是一次過還錢，還是分別還去3個戶口。Mark Simon 則稱會稍後回覆。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，大概在7月底，Mark Simon 回覆他，指李可以還款去任何一個戶口，但最好是一筆過地還款。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問 Mark Simon 有否提及該3個戶口的持有人是誰。陳引述 Mark Simon 指3個戶口「都係佢老細」，但是沒有提及戶口持有人是誰，換言之 Mark Simon 實際上只提供了3個戶口號碼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，他其後把 Mark Simon 的說話及3個還款戶口號碼轉述給李宇軒，數天之後，李宇軒「佢就話佢找咗筆錢喇」。控方問該筆貸款是否有利息，陳則指沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華mark-simon和黎智英滿意g20登報效果-並稱可就展覽提供協助&quot;&gt;陳梓華：Mark Simon和黎智英滿意G20登報效果 並稱可就展覽提供協助&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華提到他與 Mark Simon 於2019年7月首次親身見面，當日在中環文華酒店的咖啡廳，同場還有 Mark Simon 的兒子，「係一個細路仔嚟嘅，然後 Mark Simon 就話呢個係佢個仔。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指二人會合後，Mark Simon 介紹自己為黎智英的助手，「咁佢就 basically 執行佢個 boss 嘅order。」陳續指，「佢（Mark Simon）首先大讚G20全球登報文宣，佢哋好滿意，佢話佢哋非常滿意個成果同效果。」而陳指「佢哋」是代表黎智英和 Mark Simon。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳引述 Mark Simon 稱：「佢認為未來嘅文宣方向，應該係延續返G20登報嘅影響力。」Mark Simon 舉例指可舉辦展覽，「因為佢話，並唔係人人都會睇報紙，若然我哋可以喺呢方面做多啲，亦都符合佢哋嘅政治理念，佢哋願意提供經濟上、人脈上，同埋傳媒方面嘅協助。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問當時 Mark Simon 有否談及其政治理念是什麼。陳指 Mark Simon 沒有特別講到政治理念，「但佢有幾次強調『民主』呢個單字。」此外，在該次會面中，Mark Simon 把一個棕色信封交給他，內含G20廣告費的發票和收據，以及3個還款戶口的資料。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱開離岸公司戶口有困難-mark-simon稱可幫忙當係個獎勵俾自己&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱開離岸公司戶口有困難 Mark Simon稱可幫忙、「當係個獎勵俾自己」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又指，Mark Simon 有問他未來想做什麼，陳當時稱有朋友想邀請他一起做生意，「其實我鍾意做生意多啲」，然後他談論了想做什麼類型的生意。Mark Simon 一度問陳是否遇到什麼困難，陳則指好難在香港開設到一間離岸公司的銀行戶口。Mark Simon 則稱「應該唔難」，並表示「其實我可以幫到你，你就當係個獎勵畀自己」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指mark-simon有提及國際游說-惟當時對國際游說沒有認知&quot;&gt;陳梓華指Mark Simon有提及國際游說 惟當時對國際游說沒有認知&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指 Mark Simon 還有問他會否繼續參與文宣工作，陳當時回答「我會繼續」。Mark Simon 有談及本土的文宣工作，也有談及「國際上面嘅 lobbying」。陳表示，「但我當時對 lobbying 冇乜認知，所以我就同佢講，我會嘗試參與更加多喺報紙展覽。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問 Mark Simon 口中的「國際上 lobbying」是指什麼。陳則表示當時不清楚。被問到游說的目的，陳指是爭取「五大訴求」，即要求政府撤回逃犯條例修訂、推翻612暴動定性及承諾不檢控被捕人士、成立獨立調查委員會調查警暴，以及落實雙普選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華視李宇軒為攬炒團隊一員&quot;&gt;陳梓華視李宇軒為「攬炒團隊」一員&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，2019年6月之後，由「攬炒巴」劉祖廸帶領的「攬炒團隊」籌辦另一次登報行動，但主題與G20不同，因G20是關於反修例和「五大訴求」，但是「攬炒團隊」的登報行動則是關於中英聯合聲明，「希望英國政府可以履行佢哋道德責任。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳提到當時有大量「公海群組」，目的是聚集更多志同道合的人，俗稱「圈人」，至於實際工作則不是在「公海」討論，而是有另外一些非公開小組。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;以陳的理解，李宇軒是「攬炒團隊」成員之一，因為當時李告訴陳，「攬炒團隊」需要有人幫手做眾籌，「我當時嘅理解係佢又想搵人墊支」，然後陳跟李說「你去做啦」，因他相信「攬炒團隊」需要一個有經驗、做過眾籌的人，而李有足夠能力協助他們處理。陳不記得李當時怎樣回覆，「但係我哋下次對話嘅時候，佢已經喺攬炒團隊入面做緊。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下周一（4月15日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 5 March 2024 – just days after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine entered its third year – the head of Russia’s State Space Cooperation Roscosmos, Yuri Borisov, announced plans for Russia and China to build an automated nuclear power plant on the Moon between 2033 and 2035.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this is not the first joint Sino-Russian venture into the final frontier – indeed, the plant’s stated purpose is to power the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS) that Russia and China introduced in 2021 – its announcement further indicates that Moscow and Beijing intend to more brazenly cooperate in space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;to-the-stars-with-nuclear&quot;&gt;To the Stars, with Nuclear&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Borisov’s announcement came on the heels of rumours the month prior about Russia’s intention to put a nuclear weapon into orbit – a claim denied by Russian President Vladimir Putin but that nonetheless elicited blowback and concern from officials in Washington and further afield, given the potential catastrophic consequences and international legal ramifications (in particular, for the 1967 Outer Space Treaty and the 1963 Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty) for the potential nuclear weaponisation of space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the use of nuclear weapons in space would violate a flurry of international treaties, as well as physically degrade the environment it is used in, the use of nuclear power in space is not outside the bounds of international law. For example, like their contemporaries at NASA and the European Space Agency, Roscosmos and the China National Space Administration (CNSA) are funding research into nuclear power for space travel, which would drastically reduce transit times and the associated health risks of prolonged radiation exposure for astronauts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As governments seek not only to go further, but to stay longer, in space, broader applications for nuclear technology are emerging. Challenges arise about the logistical challenges facing more permanent presences on the Moon – among them the consistent supply of energy to operate stations and bases for astronauts. Solar panels, which have sufficed for smaller-scale operations such as lunar rovers and are often the energy source of choice for space assets, would not be as efficient for larger and more permanent activities on the Moon, where the sun cycle means that “night” lasts a little over two weeks on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;By positioning itself with China, Russia is sending a further clear signal of stepping away from Western initiatives&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is no surprise, then, that space agencies are also considering nuclear power as an energy source for lunar bases. In 2022, China was reportedly considering a nuclear energy source for its base on the Moon’s south pole. Similarly, NASA is developing a Fission Surface Power Project for operation on the Moon that would be available to other space agency partners, and the UK Space Agency recently awarded Rolls-Royce research funding for an eventual lunar nuclear reactor. Although specific timelines vary, each lunar nuclear reactor plan – including the joint China–Russia one envisaged by Borisov – anticipates completion by the mid-2030s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That completion deadline is, of course, subject to everything running smoothly – something which even Borisov seemed to acknowledge in his remarks, mentioning that the power plant would need to be constructed by robots and that Russia (and, presumably, China) have yet to develop the materials capable of withstanding the intense heat generated by the nuclear reactors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sino-russo-ambitions-in-space&quot;&gt;Sino-Russo Ambitions in Space&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the proposition of a nuclear power plant on the Moon is not revelatory, neither is cooperation between Russia and China in space more broadly. The space partnership between Russia and China gained traction in 2014 and gradually grew over the next seven years, ultimately leading to the ILRS announcement in early March 2021 – potentially in response to the unveiling of NASA’s Artemis programme, which prioritises multinational collaboration and intends to send a crewed mission to the Moon by 2025, with a continuous presence by 2028. This project is a continuation of this wider partnership and leverages the comparative advantages of both Moscow and Beijing. Russia’s nuclear expertise surpasses that of China, while China – despite its shorter history as a spacefaring country – has more to offer in space, especially in terms of funding. In 2023, the CNSA allocated $14.15 billion for space programmes (a nearly 19% increase from $11.17 billion in 2022), while Russia only allocated $3.41 billion (a slight decrease from $3.42 billion in 2022).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia does not just need the extra money however – the status that is conferred on Russia by being one of the original space powers has more to do with its legacy than the reality of its current capabilities. The renewed sanctions, also specifically targeting the aerospace sector, in 2022 have added to Russia’s long list of problems in space. Simply put, if Moscow wants to continue to be a significant player in space, as it has been as a partner aboard the International Space Station (ISS), it needs to find a strong partner. This goes especially for costly and long-term projects such as lunar bases. By positioning itself with China, Russia is sending a further clear signal of stepping away from Western initiatives. The baseline requirement for this collaboration is a willingness to work alongside each other – something that China appeared to distance itself from immediately following the invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinas-course-change&quot;&gt;China’s Course Change&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just under one year after the signing of the memorandum of understanding on the ILRS, Russia commenced its illegal invasion and occupation of Ukrainian sovereign territory, drawing ire, condemnation and swift retribution from the international community. In response, China appeared to quickly distance itself from its northern neighbour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Space has never been an apolitical place and the hardened political lines that can be observed on Earth are also clearly visible there&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the September 2022 International Astronautical Congress (IAC) in Paris, China kept quiet about Russian involvement in its space projects, with a session run by the CNSA framing the ILRS as an extension of previous Chinese space exploration initiatives. Following the 2022 IAC, China continued to downplay or outright omit its space partnership with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Borisov’s public announcement of his country’s ambitious collaboration with China in the next decade was made without the implicit approval of the Chinese government, it would likely not bode well for future cooperation. So, assuming that was not the case, his statements may indicate that China is increasingly committed to publicly associating with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;is-russia-a-disruptive-business-partner-for-china&quot;&gt;Is Russia a Disruptive Business Partner for China?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although China’s implicit consent to the announcement of a joint lunar nuclear plant with Russia is not a radical policy pivot – the Chinese government has yet to make a direct announcement about the initiative, and tensions between Russia and China on myriad other issues still remain – it indicates an increasingly likely future where interstellar cooperation is mired in polarised geopolitics. This is an especially pivotal moment, given the worries that emerged over Russian plans of a nuclear weapon in space. China, which has developed its space capabilities rapidly over the past few decades, could be set to lose a lot should such a weapon be deployed. In this case, China may be calculating to keep a disruptive Russia close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its core, this apparent renewal of earlier Sino-Soviet space cooperation reveals Russia’s intention to more closely align with China in space travel and exploration, and China’s willingness to embrace its role as an emerging centre of space pioneering. The soft power element of this development should not be overlooked. China will soon be the only country with a continuous human presence in orbit through its Tiangong space station, as the ISS – a collaboration between several partners, including the US and Russia – is set to be decommissioned around 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If recent ramifications of great power competition between Russia and China and the West – such as concerns about a looming renewal of the nuclear arms race – are any indication of the state of the geopolitical arena, the polarisation of space could have similar destructive consequences. Space has never been an apolitical place and the hardened political lines that can be observed on Earth are also clearly visible there – if not more obviously so. As such, NASA is legally barred from spending public funds on cooperation with China – making a collaboration between the two, as seen with Roscosmos, impossible at this point. After Russia’s previously problematic statements about the future of the ISS, it is now clearly positioning itself with emerged space power China. What remains to be seen is how Russia acts within this relationship and if, more broadly, the two countries can continue their uneasy business partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, unprecedented and comprehensive sanctions have been imposed on it. Among the measures taken in the first several months of the war were the immobilisation of the Bank of Russia’s reserves, sanctions on several large Russian financial institutions and their disconnection from SWIFT, the EU’s embargo on Russian oil, the G7 oil price cap regime, and comprehensive export controls on dual-use goods. More restrictions have been added since. However, the focus of the work of governments, think tanks and wider civil society has shifted to questions of implementation and enforcement. As the Russia sanctions regime is likely to remain in place for years, these issues will continue to play a major role. In addition, they are of utmost importance for the future credibility of sanctions beyond the Russia case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coalition’s actions have had a significant impact on Russia – curtailing export earnings, reducing policy space and limiting access to critical inputs for its military industry. But clearly, they have not succeeded yet at achieving their ultimate objective: to bring the war to an end and rein in the threat to peace and prosperity in Europe – as well as to the rules-based international order – that Russia poses. In fact, serious issues hinder effective implementation and enforcement of key measures such as the oil price cap and export controls. Over a period of more than two years, the RUSI-led European Sanctions and Illicit Finance Monitoring and Analysis Network (SIFMANet) has contributed to efforts aimed at understanding which sanctions work, which are plagued by practical challenges, and what needs to be done to improve their effectiveness and ensure their credibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previous SIFMANet events have established that all stakeholders – whether governments monitoring sanctions circumvention and evasion, private sector actors seeking to ensure their compliance with the restrictions, or civil society attempting to shed light on key developments – need more and better data. To gain further insights on this issue, the Centre for Finance and Security at RUSI hosted a roundtable discussion in Riga in March 2024, with the support of the Financial Intelligence Unit of Latvia, the National Endowment for Democracy and the Latvian Institute of International Affairs. The event gathered experts from public and private sectors across Europe to explore, under the Chatham House rule, the critical importance of data sharing and develop proposals for improvements in this area. This report summarises the main findings from the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;data-is-critical-for-effective-sanctions-implementation&quot;&gt;Data is Critical for Effective Sanctions Implementation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way sanctions are thought about has changed dramatically in recent years – and with it, the approach to implementation and enforcement. Participants of the roundtable agreed that, for many years, sanctions – if they were more than simply a foreign policy messaging tool – largely fell on to the compliance departments of financial institutions. A global economy made traditional trade embargoes much more difficult to enforce. In response, the US began to leverage the primacy of its financial system to extend the reach of its sanctions. The threat of disconnection from correspondent banking accounts and loss of access to the US dollar meant that most financial institutions around the world had no choice but to comply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion described the Russia sanctions regime as fundamentally different from past cases in several respects. First, the sanctions coalition’s measures target an economy more integrated into trade and global financial flows than in any previous case. Second, the measures go far beyond restrictions on the financial system – they include interventions into global energy markets as well as complex supply chains and distribution networks for dual-use goods. Third, the Russia sanctions aim to restrict an aggressor’s capacities during an ongoing military confrontation, putting a much greater sense of urgency on making them work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As SIFMANet discussions have established previously, data is key. Governments need as much information as possible to guide the implementation of sanctions at home, to investigate and prosecute violators, and to target circumvention networks in third countries. But it is not only the public sector that relies on data. Financial and non-financial corporates can only ensure that their business activities comply with sanctions if they have access to a wide range of information. Finally, think tanks such as RUSI and its partners use data to complement governments’ efforts in the area of sanctions. The complexity of the issues at hand as well as resource constraints in the public sector mean that ensuring their effective implementation and enforcement truly must be a whole-of-society effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants of the roundtable recognised that the use of data has improved noticeably over the past two years. Many of the agencies involved in analysing and improving the effectiveness of sanctions now have access to a wealth of critical information. In addition, they have stepped up their efforts to analyse this data by linking information from different sources. Furthermore, cooperation between different agencies – within governments and across jurisdictions – has increased significantly over the past two years. Important challenges on data access and sharing remain, but participants agreed that substantial progress has been made in understanding how sanctions work in practice and on the operation of Russian evasion schemes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-changing-focus-from-red-flags-to-actionable-evidence&quot;&gt;A Changing Focus: From “Red Flags” to Actionable Evidence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The increasing complexity of the Russia sanctions regime poses major challenges for implementation and enforcement – and calls for a different approach to the use of data. For instance, assessing the effectiveness of the G7 oil price cap requires that government agencies not only establish that a certain transaction involving Russian oil as well as a coalition-based entity took place, but also identify the specific contractual terms – that is, the price – at which it did. This information must be collected from a variety of sources – which are not always publicly available and whose reliability raises legitimate concerns – and be merged to develop a comprehensive picture. Think tanks face essentially the same limitations and challenges when it comes to their work in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example of the magnitude of the task concerns the private sector. Many large economies do not participate in the sanctions, pushing trade and financial transactions to places with far less transparency. For instance, participants highlighted that a large share of Russia’s imports of so-called “battlefield goods” continues to come from coalition-based producers but via third-country intermediaries in China, Turkey and the UAE, as well as countries in the Caucasus and Central Asia. Non-financial corporates are being asked to go well beyond traditional sanctions screening of business partners. Instead, they are tasked with controlling complex supply chains and distribution networks – a task for which they are neither prepared nor properly incentivised. In addition, the cross-jurisdictional nature of the transactions itself provides considerable room to conceal illicit activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For civil society, the task has also changed. Participating authorities emphasised that governments are looking for researchers and think tanks to identify much more than suspicious patterns or “red flags”. Rather, enforcement agencies are seeking actionable information that can be used to prosecute sanctions violators and/or target entities with new restrictions. In addition, they seek concrete and detailed assessments of how their measures impact transactions and sanctions compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-challenges-surrounding-data-availability-sharing-and-use&quot;&gt;Key Challenges Surrounding Data Availability, Sharing and Use&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the discussion in Riga, several key points emerged on the challenges of acquiring, sharing and properly using data for effective sanctions implementation and enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;missing-and-inconsistent-information&quot;&gt;Missing and Inconsistent Information&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, the Russia sanctions regime differs from past cases (such as Iran and North Korea) insofar as it imposes complex restrictions on trade and financial transactions. In addition, it has led to multi-layered and cross-jurisdictional circumvention and evasion schemes. This means that authorities in coalition countries must acquire and merge information from a wide variety of sources. This is often challenging. For instance, identifying a violation of the G7 oil price cap requires data on the entities involved in oil transport as well as on the price of the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if access to the information is secured, it is often difficult to match it to other data and develop a comprehensive picture. On export controls, participants added that an understanding of the entire supply chain and distribution network is needed to determine if a coalition-based producer of battlefield goods has violated sanctions. As the physical shipments of such goods largely take place outside of coalition countries, their own customs data is of little help. And many countries through which the bulk of this trade is conducted do not share information because they do not participate in the sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authorities can certainly establish that suspicious activities take place, but their ultimate objective of generating actionable intelligence is severely impacted by data constraints. To an extent, these are also the result of regulatory gaps. For instance, incomplete customs declarations can be penalised or prosecuted – but rarely are. And important fields in SWIFT are optional. This includes some that would be critical for the monitoring and identification of potential violations, including locations where physical shipments related to financial flows took place as well as trade codes identifying goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;access-to-and-quality-of-external-data&quot;&gt;Access to and Quality of External Data&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To a large extent, governments, the private sector and civil society have relied on Russian trade data to assess the effectiveness of sanctions. But with Russia increasingly restricting access to its data, representatives from these three sectors acknowledge that their ability to monitor developments is at risk. While some important information is commercially available, its reliability can be legitimately questioned. And such questions extend beyond Russian data. Outreach to countries that are strongly suspected to function as circumvention hubs – Turkey, countries in the Caucasus and Central Asia – has been a focus of coalition governments and the EU. One of the key objectives is to acquire data which can shine light on the extent of illicit transactions and the people and entities involved. Beyond capacity constraints that compromise the quality of the information, customs data is often incomplete (for example, due to smuggling) and/or subject to falsification. In fact, coalition authorities often find significant inconsistencies when comparing data related to the exact same transaction from different sources. Most often, codes identifying the goods in question – so-called Harmonised System (HS) codes – differ between exports to Russia as reported in coalition or third-country customs declarations and imports from those countries to Russia as reflected in the Russian trade data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;data-sharing-within-the-public-sector&quot;&gt;Data Sharing Within the Public Sector&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the countries that have imposed sanctions on Russia have decentralised implementation and enforcement structures. Participants provided several examples for responsibilities being divided between multiple institutions – ministries of foreign affairs, finance, and economy as well as customs services, banking supervisors, financial intelligence units (FIUs) and law enforcement agencies. This inevitably leads to a less-than-optimal exchange of information and can slow down procedures. Challenges related to data sharing go beyond issues related to institutional setup, however. In many countries, data protection standards are high, making it difficult for key agencies to access information. This can be the case, for instance, for information on physical flows of goods provided by customs services, and on financial transactions provided by central banks and FIUs. Barriers can generally be overcome in the case of suspicions of concrete illicit actions, but they often inhibit efforts to monitor sanctions-related developments more broadly. Detecting problematic patterns and developing strategies to improve the effectiveness of sanctions is, thus, made more complicated. Similar challenges exist for data sharing between governments. In addition, existing systems for information exchange – such as the Egmont Group, which facilitates cooperation between FIUs – are set up for very specific purposes and are limited to specific types of data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;decentralised-enforcement-in-the-eu&quot;&gt;Decentralised Enforcement in the EU&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue of decentralisation extends beyond individual governments. In the EU, despite 13 sanctions packages at the union level, member states are responsible for carrying out these measures in practice. And, not surprisingly, participants of the discussion reported that the 27 countries do things very differently. This concerns the institutional setup (that is, who is in charge of sanctions-related issues), staffing and resources (that is, what capacities are available for the task at hand), legal frameworks (that is, national legislation and regulations, criminalisation of violations, among others), access to critical information and political priorities. Inevitably, this leads to the fragmentation of sanctions enforcement and implementation in the EU. The involvement of government agencies from 27 member states – where responsibilities are also often split up between multiple players (as outlined above) – and the EU’s own institutions poses serious practical challenges to an effective exchange of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;private-sector-capacity-constraints&quot;&gt;Private Sector Capacity Constraints&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, sanctions implementation has often fallen on the private sector, especially the compliance departments of financial institutions. The Russia sanctions regime is only exacerbating this dynamic. For instance, non-financial corporates have to control their supply chains and distribution networks related to goods critical for the Russian military industry. While buy-in from the private sector is essential, participants pointed out that governments must recognise existing capacity constraints to develop a sanctions implementation approach that works in practice. Many of the producers whose goods continue to reach Russia are large multinational corporations with significant resources to establish compliance structures and carry out the due diligence that is required of them – but not all of the involved companies are. Many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are involved as well, especially in the manufacturing of hi-tech machinery such as CNC machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;slow-pace-of-adaptation-to-challenges&quot;&gt;Slow Pace of Adaptation to Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to recognise that economic sanctions are not static. Rather, they require frequent adjustments as their target adapts to restrictions and establishes evasion and circumvention schemes. This is particularly relevant in the current case of a far-from-global sanctions regime and an adversary – Russia – that has considerable experience with manoeuvring around such restrictions. After all, it has done so for roughly 10 years since sanctions were first imposed in 2014. Participants expressed serious concerns about the ability of coalition government to react swiftly to Russia’s actions and, more fundamentally, questioned if the issue is treated with a proper sense of urgency. For Russia on the other hand, the existential nature of the challenge is clear. And, as an increasingly repressive dictatorship, Russia has more flexibility to act compared with the democratic systems of the coalition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;leveraging-the-role-of-the-financial-industry&quot;&gt;Leveraging the Role of the Financial Industry&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A topic that had emerged at previous SIFMANet events was again the focus in Riga: the financial industry’s role in sanctions implementation and enforcement. As mentioned above, banks have been involved in these efforts for a long time, but their responsibilities are likely to grow significantly. US President Joe Biden’s Executive Order of 22 December 2023 sent a clear message to foreign financial institutions that they risk losing access to the US financial system if they facilitate significant transactions relating to Russia’s military-industrial base. This represents a clear threat of secondary sanctions in the area of export controls. However, it will likely also make banks much more careful when it comes to any other transactions that involve Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants expressed support for leveraging the role of banks in cross-border transactions to improve the effectiveness of the Russia sanctions regime. But they also urged caution regarding such an approach’s practical execution. For instance, simply adding new requirements to the industry’s compliance efforts is unlikely to result in functional procedures without proper guidance. What is more, efforts to involve the financial industry will need to go beyond those global banks that have traditionally been tasked with the implementation of sanctions. Financial flows are fungible and, especially when related to illicit activities, will be quickly redirected through any entities not in focus. This concerns smaller traditional banks as well as non-bank financial institutions such as payments services providers or actors in the crypto sphere. These entities, however, are not insulated from sanctions. Many of them also rely on access to the US financial system and the US dollar. They are also connected, through correspondent accounts and other business dealings, with those large global banks that have substantial experience with sanctions compliance and could hand on due diligence requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendations-data-is-key-to-making-sanctions-work&quot;&gt;Recommendations: Data is Key to Making Sanctions Work&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way sanctions are viewed has changed dramatically. Implementation and enforcement of an ever-more comprehensive and complex sanctions regime poses new and growing challenges to governments, the private sector and civil society more broadly. Data is key to making these measures work as effectively as possible and constrain Russia’s ability to continue its war of aggression against Ukraine. Specifically, access to data as well as its effective exchange and use are critical to assessing and improving the implementation of sanctions at home, investigating and prosecuting violations, and informing steps to rein in circumvention networks abroad. Throughout the roundtable, participants discussed ideas to improve data-related efforts. The specific recommendations from the event are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Centralise sanctions responsibilities within countries.&lt;/strong&gt; Some EU member states are leading the way when it comes to centralising sanctions-related functions by designating competent authorities for implementation and enforcement. Participants expressed that cooperation and coordination within governments and across borders, including for data, would benefit from other countries following suit. As sanctions will remain a key element of foreign policy in the coming years, now is the time to equip institutions with proper resources and procedures. Clearly assigning responsibilities and mandates must be an integral part of this strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improve cooperation and data sharing across jurisdictions.&lt;/strong&gt; One of the key findings of the roundtable is that authorities across the coalition have much better access to information now than two years ago. In addition, efforts are underway to link different data sources to develop a comprehensive view on the effectiveness of sanctions. However, improvements are needed when it comes to the exchange of information across jurisdictions. Existing systems require modifications so that they can be used to address the challenges emerging from the type of unprecedented and comprehensive sanctions that have been imposed on Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exchange best practices and learn from one another.&lt;/strong&gt; Some jurisdictions, mainly the US, have significantly more experience with comprehensive financial and technology sanctions. All involved countries should cooperate closely on best practices and learn from one another’s successes and failures. Specifically, authorities across the coalition should look at jurisdictions where sanctions violations have been successfully prosecuted in the past and assess how they can implement the most-effective procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leverage the role of financial institutions in trade.&lt;/strong&gt; Banks have emerged as a key player in sanctions implementation and enforcement and their role will only grow in areas such as export controls as it may be easier to trace trade-related financial transactions than physical shipments. While banks have established compliance resources and procedures and already provide much information to supervisory bodies and other enforcement agencies, it is critical to enable them to play an expanded role by adapting the regulatory framework. For instance, certain fields in SWIFT such as HS trade codes should be made mandatory. Otherwise, it will be extremely difficult for banks to identify red flags and stop illicit transactions in their tracks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expand interactions with non-financial corporates.&lt;/strong&gt; Many coalition governments have taken steps to reach out to the private sector beyond the financial industry to provide guidance and offer technical assistance. It is critical that they continue to do so regularly and intensify this cooperation. With sanctions evasion and circumvention networks adapting rapidly to changing conditions on the ground, government agencies must engage in an ongoing dialogue with the private sector. Importantly, this should include establishing clear feedback mechanisms through which they can tap into companies’ expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work with trade organisations to extend reach.&lt;/strong&gt; As more comprehensive and complex sanctions place growing responsibilities on the private sector, it is critical to make sure that SMEs can also play their role. Given their relative lack of resources and experience with sanctions compliance, governments should work closely with trade organisations to provide guidance and technical assistance to companies. Industry bodies should be leveraged to ensure that due diligence efforts go beyond large multinationals.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Involve civil society in sanctions monitoring efforts.&lt;/strong&gt; The experience of the past two years has shown that civil society – including institutes such as RUSI and research networks such as SIFMANet – plays an essential role in using data to assess the effectiveness of sanctions and develop concrete recommendations for their improvement. Think tanks, NGOs and other similar organisations not only complement scarce resources in the public sector but can also provide a more strategic vision, which is often crowded out by governments’ urgent policy design and implementation tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continue diplomatic outreach to third countries.&lt;/strong&gt; Considering the limits of data availability and important gaps in the tracing of supply chains and distribution networks, coalition governments need to undertake efforts to gain access to information from third countries. While not the case for all jurisdictions involved in sanctions evasion and circumvention (such as China and the UAE), many, especially in the Caucasus and Central Asia, can be incentivised to share more data as they are interested in deeper commercial ties with the EU and other coalition countries. Data sharing, however, will not be sufficient if not accompanied by technical assistance to public and private sectors alike to build capacities and improve data reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roundtable participants stressed that it will become clear in the coming months if coalition countries are up to the task of responding decisively and quickly to Russia’s attempts to work around the sanctions regime. Fundamentally, they were optimistic that, if the extraordinary wealth of information available is leveraged to assess the effectiveness of existing measures, identify and prosecute violators, as well as develop strategies to improve the implementation and enforcement of sanctions, Russia’s capacity to wage war on Ukraine and undermine the rules-based international order can be constrained. It will require improvements to institutional setups and the facilitation of information exchange within governments and across borders, as well as leveraging the role of the private sector and involving civil society. More fundamentally, it will need an understanding of the existential nature of the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（11日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第58日審訊。「十二港人」之一李宇軒繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供，他表示在《國安法》之前理解自己會見外國議員等活動是合法。在《國安法》生效之後，李和另一名被告陳梓華曾討論是否繼續國際游說和倡議工作，還是到美國任職非政府組織「中國人權」，後來李決定繼續游說工作，「呢個決定唔係一個令我特別 comfortable 嘅決定，但對我嚟講，佢似乎係一個 least evil 嘅決定。」李形容《國安法》條文含糊，又預料北京會「搬龍門」來針對政敵，法官問李為何不停止游說工作，李則表示：「因為如果北京覺得你係政敵嘅話，就算你做唔做某啲嘢，佢都會搵到方法嚟政治檢控你。所以我繼唔繼續做一啲嘢，無關係。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「十二港人」之一李宇軒第15天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。代表黎智英的新西蘭御用大律師 Marc Corlett 盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;曾赴聯合國及會見外國議員-李宇軒國安法之前是合法活動&quot;&gt;曾赴聯合國及會見外國議員 李宇軒：國安法之前是合法活動&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，在2020年7月1日《國安法》生效之前，李曾會見訪港的美國議員 Rick Scott、到訪聯合國和法國，以及協助「攬炒巴」劉祖廸接待訪港的英國議員 Bob Seely。辯方問以李的理解，上述活動在《國安法》生效之前是否合法。李回答：「合法嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，李所面對的控罪涵蓋2020年7月1日至2021年2月15日，所以並沒有因為上述的活動而被起訴，而李直到現在仍然相信這些活動是合法的。李同意：「全部合法嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在辯方的盤問下，李確認在2019年6月至2020年7月期間，「重光團隊」（Fight for Freedom, Stand with Hong Kong，簡稱 SWHK）內部從來沒有共識推舉李代表 SWHK 做任何違法行為，而李也沒有基於協議而同意做違法行為，以及沒有協助其他人去做違法行為。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李並確認，他不知道上述活動是違法，直至2020年6月30日午夜《國安法》條文出爐，又指：「《國安法》會令之前合法的行為變成不合法。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示李宇軒與「對華政策跨國議會聯盟」（Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China，簡稱 IPAC）創辦人裴倫德（Luke de Pulford）之間的 Telegram 訊息對話。李向裴倫德指《國安法》條文中文版已公佈，條文內容比想像中更差（“it’s worse than we thought”），又指根據條文裴倫德已經犯了法（“you have committed a crime according to the text :)”）：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李庭上解釋，上述訊息的意思是裴倫德既不是香港公民也不身處於香港的司法管轄區之內，但《國安法》第38條提及「域外效力」，所以根據條文定義，裴倫德已經是犯了法，「同埋《國安法》個條文，我係覺得好 vague（含糊）嘅」，因此可以廣闊到涵蓋裴倫德正在做的事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒憂北京用國安法針對政敵-向裴倫德提議游說各國取消引渡協議&quot;&gt;李宇軒：憂北京用國安法針對政敵 向裴倫德提議游說各國取消引渡協議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年7月2日，李宇軒向裴倫德徵詢意見，問他是否應該游說其他國家取消與香港的司法互助和引渡協議，以及國際倡議的效用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李庭上解釋：「我理解《國安法》第29條個用字係好闊，而第38條係講緊全球嘅人都適用，類似咁解」，加上北京對於條文的廣闊詮釋，預料《國安法》「會用落 political enemy 度」，所以他透過訊息告訴裴倫德「《國安法》會 reach 到你個國家，同埋其他國家嘅 citizens」，為了保障其他國家的公民，有需要檢視是否取消與香港的司法互助和引渡逃犯協議，「防止《國安法》的政治檢控落到去你個國家同其他國家嘅公民度。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒稱北京總會找到方法針對政敵-與是否繼續做手上工作沒有關係&quot;&gt;李宇軒稱北京總會找到方法針對政敵 與是否繼續做手上工作沒有關係&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問李對於《國安法》「紅線」有什麼理解，包括有什麼事可做、有什麼事不可以做。李回答：「我嘅 understanding 係北京會搬龍門，所以冇得由我或者其他嘅 citizens 去知道個紅線喺邊，rather 我嘅 understanding 會係有一個 broad 嘅 interpretation 去畀北京搬龍門。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，既然李有上述擔憂，為何不直接叫裴倫德停止他手上的工作。李則回答：「因為我覺得北京會搬龍門，所以即使你唔做一樣嘢，如果北京要政治檢控你，佢就會用第二啲嘢嚟 charge 你。」李續指，無論是否《國安法》也好，北京會「搬龍門」說現在起訴的罪名已經是法律所涵蓋範圍。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官追問，《國安法》條文有提及對於《國安法》生效之前的行為沒有追溯力。惟李表示：「我唔信嗰條文會係好似字面咁解地去被 interpreted。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官又問，為何他不停止正在做的事。李宇軒表示：「因為如果北京覺得你係政敵嘅話，就算你做唔做某啲嘢，佢都會搵到方法嚟政治檢控你。所以我繼唔繼續做一啲嘢，無關係。」李官說，所以李決定繼續做下去。李宇軒同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;國安法後決定繼續國際游說-李宇軒指似乎係一個least-evil嘅決定&quot;&gt;國安法後決定繼續國際游說 李宇軒指「似乎係一個least evil嘅決定」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方另展示李宇軒與另一名被告陳梓華（網名T）在2020年7月23日的 Signal 訊息對話，二人討論李是否應該到美國的非政府組織「中國人權」工作，或者繼續做國際游說工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，直到當天，李就《國安法》對他是否有影響的理解，是否與《國安法》剛開始生效的時候差不多，還是有改變。李則表示，「我當時覺得反而係 confirm 咗我對《國安法》嘅 suspicion，因為真係用咗佢嚟拉嗰啲社運人士。」所以他在7月2日與裴倫德傳送訊息時提及對於《國安法》的理解，直至7月23日時仍然一樣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問李後來決定繼續做游說工作，是否他自己的決定。李則表示有跟陳梓華討論過，又表示：「呢個決定唔係一個令我特別 comfortable 嘅決定，但對我嚟講，佢似乎係一個 least evil 嘅決定。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，李當時面對兩個選項，一是冒著更大觸犯法律和被拘捕的風險，二是不繼續游說工作，然而李卻選擇了前者。李則回答：「唔係，我當時個 mind 入面唔係呢兩個選項」，當時他懷疑北京可能已經將他視為政敵，所以政權已經有方法拘捕及起訴他，但是擺在他面前的問題是「即使繼唔繼續，都會被拘捕」，因此他當時考慮的問題是應否繼續游說工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒確認swhk從沒公開提流亡政府&quot;&gt;李宇軒確認SWHK從沒公開提流亡政府&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，李宇軒和陳梓華曾經討論在外地成立流亡政府，問李是否同意 SWHK 從來沒有在其網站發布相關內容。李同意，他又指 SWHK 內部從來沒有討論過成立流亡政府。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指李從沒有採取任何行動成立流亡政府。李則表示他曾經問過梁頌恆、陳浩天、黃台仰和梁繼平等人是否願意籌組流亡政府，但他們均表示不會做。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒指更新swhk和ipac網站之前不會徵詢黎智英mark-simon或陳梓華&quot;&gt;李宇軒指更新SWHK和IPAC網站之前不會徵詢黎智英、Mark Simon或陳梓華&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李早前供稱他協助 SWHK 將內容上載至網站。在辯方的盤問下，李確認他並沒有負責將內容發佈至 SWHK 的 Facebook 和 Twitter，新聞稿也不是他撰寫的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問李，他上載文章等內容至 SWHK 網站之前，並沒有與黎智英或其私人助手 Mark Simon 討論過。李確認。至於陳梓華，李表示他與陳有討論過一些 SWHK 的活動，但是他把活動資料上載至網站時，並不會事先徵詢陳梓華。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，《國安法》生效之後，李繼續協助 IPAC 更新網站，和列席會議，並指李事前從沒與黎智英和 Mark Simon 討論。李同意：「冇討論過。」至於陳梓華，李表示他有時與陳討論 IPAC 的事，但不會在更新網站之前徵詢陳的意見或批准。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李又確認他在不會對其他人作出指示，「我可以邀請人哋去幫手，as an individual activist」，例如有一份 IPAC 會議紀錄，他會問日本群組的會否自願幫手，但他不可以落指示：「喂，你一定要過嚟翻譯啦！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（11日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第58日審訊。「十二港人」之一李宇軒繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。辯方盤問時指，另一名被告陳梓華曾經告訴李，如果香港成立到軍隊的話，以色列軍隊可以協助訓練「勇武」人士，李確認陳曾提出這想法，但「我唔知佢有幾認真」。此外，李亦確認陳提及其「勇武隊」涉及7.21白衣人事件，以及2020年農曆新年期間邊境口岸的爆炸品事件。李於2020年8月10日被捕，他確認從警署獲釋之後，陳在電話中聲稱會安排他離開香港。李指，其後有不同的帳戶使用「化名」告知他入住「安全屋」、乘坐專車到布袋澳碼頭和聯絡「船家」等，並叫他乘船到達台灣之後自動投案，因已將李的個人資料交給陸委會。李又指有人告訴他，當時有捷克代表訪台，當李獲釋之後，若果趕得及的話，應該跟隨捷克的代表乘坐回程的私人包機，到達捷克之後便找方法前往倫敦。惟「走鬼」計劃未能成事，李最終被大陸公安拘捕。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「十二港人」之一李宇軒第15天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。代表黎智英的新西蘭御用大律師 Marc Corlett 盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方陳梓華把勇武小隊隊長介紹給李宇軒&quot;&gt;辯方：陳梓華把「勇武小隊隊長」介紹給李宇軒&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對於另一名被告陳梓華（網名T）是否帶領多於一隊「勇武小隊」，李宇軒表示不知道。辯方又問以李所理解，陳是否視「勇武」為削弱香港政府管治的方法。李則表示，以他對陳的理解，陳認為「勇武」能夠「做到一個政權唔係實際上管治到一個領土」。至於陳是否認同使用「勇武」，李則指：「部份同意，或者 conditionally agree。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方提到，陳梓華曾經叫李宇軒到火炭工業區一幢建築物見面，並將一名叫「Cap」的人介紹給李，同場還有一名叫「Cath」的女子和一名叫「廢老」的男子。辯方問，陳介紹「Cap」時，有否形容他是「勇武小隊隊長」。李指「Cap」即是「Captain」，所以他估計其名稱是這個意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，陳梓華有否告訴李「Cath」是負責製造爆炸品和汽油彈。李則指「冇咁 detail」，當時陳使用「科學實驗」字眼，而且作出「引號」的手勢。辯方又問，陳有否提及「勇武隊」儲藏爆炸品的地方。李指：「應該係話，T 嗰隊勇武有自己嘅地方擺佢自己嘅嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒指陳梓華曾提及口岸爆炸品事件與其勇武隊有關不滿有人咁快玩槍&quot;&gt;李宇軒指陳梓華曾提及口岸爆炸品事件與其「勇武隊」有關、不滿有人「咁快玩槍」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，陳有否告訴李，陳的「勇武隊」曾經涉及7.21白衣人事件之中。李確認有，但不肯定陳是否在火炭那次會面中講過。辯方又問，陳有否提及他的隊伍涉及中聯辦外的騷亂事件。李則指陳並沒有詳述，只說過「搞中聯辦嗰次」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，陳有否提及其隊伍牽涉在2020年農曆新年期間邊境口岸放置爆炸品的事件。李指陳曾提及事件與他的「勇武隊」有關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又問，就大埔有人開槍的事件，陳有否向李提及過。李指陳只說過「有人喺大埔玩槍」，之後說了類似：「屌，做乜咁快玩槍呀！」李並指，「屌」一字在該句說話中是重要，「一來我係理解 T 係知道呢件事，同埋佢 disapproved of 嗰個人，同埋屌嗰個人咁 pre-maturely 玩槍。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒確認陳梓華曾提及以色列軍隊可協助訓練勇武-惟不知是否認真&quot;&gt;李宇軒確認陳梓華曾提及以色列軍隊可協助訓練「勇武」 惟不知是否認真&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，在另一個場合之中，陳梓華曾向李宇軒談及如果成立到流亡政府的話，陳會負責成立和訓練軍隊。李則指這是兩條不同戰線，「如果將國際游說推到盡，就係成立流亡政府；如果將啲勇武推到盡，就係軍隊。」辯方追問，陳有否說過會訓練軍隊。李指如果成立到軍隊的話，會由陳或其他發展出來。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，在另一個場合中，陳告訴李，如果成立到軍隊的話，以色列軍隊可以協助訓練「勇武」。李則指上述似乎不是陳說話原文，而且陳好像是在談論其他事的時候提出這想法，但「我唔知佢有幾認真」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒確認被捕後陳梓華稱會安排他離開香港&quot;&gt;李宇軒確認被捕後陳梓華稱會安排他離開香港&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，李宇軒在2020年8月23日涉非法偷越邊境罪而被拘捕。李確認，並指「畀大陸公安拉」：「大陸嗰啲著住藍色衫，膊頭有個牌寫住公安嗰啲。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，李原本在2020年8月10日在香港被拘捕，其後在8月12日獲警方批准擔保。李獲釋之後，曾與陳梓華透過電話通話，而陳稱會替李安排離開香港。李確認，但實際安排方面，「我唔知係佢（陳）做，定係第二啲人做，然後由佢傳話。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，在2020年8月18日，陳梓華叫李前往將軍澳日出康城。惟李指他原本的手機被警方沒收，從警署獲釋之後，他使用另一部手機作為「鬼機」，而他百份之一百肯定所有聯絡他的人都是使用「化名（pseudo name）」。李表示，雖然陳知悉他的「鬼機」電話號碼，但是當有一個人叫他前往日出康城時，他不肯定對方是否與陳梓華有關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李又指，有人安排「走鬼」期間，會有不同的帳戶聯絡他，中間這些帳戶甚至通訊軟件也換過幾次，雖然他不肯定是否一個人聯絡他，但是從訊息來看，「好似 pick up 到當時發生咩事個 thread，咁我就 trust it。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李指除了陳梓華之外，知道他使用「鬼機」的人還有其大妹 Beatrice。而李相信陳梓華和其大妹將他的情況告知其他人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒確認有人安排安全屋專車和船家-並叫他到台灣後投案&quot;&gt;李宇軒確認有人安排「安全屋」、專車和「船家」 並叫他到台灣後投案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李亦確認曾經有一個帳戶叫他提防被跟蹤，但是不肯定對方是否陳梓華。此外，李確認有一個人將「安全屋」業主的聯絡方法交給他，告訴他有專車接送他去另一間「安全屋」，而且車上有「畀我換嘅衫」，但李不知道對方是否陳梓華。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，陳梓華或另一個帳戶是否在2020年8月23日凌晨3時，叫李前往西貢布袋澳碼頭。李記得當時是深夜，但不知道是什麼時間。李又確認，陳梓華或另一個帳戶將「船家」的聯絡方法交給他，而此前他已經知道他將會去台灣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李確認，陳梓華或另一個帳戶曾叫他乘船到達台灣之後自動投案，對方亦稱已經將李的個人資料交給陸委會。李指有人告訴他，當時捷克有代表訪台，當李獲釋之後，若果趕得及的話，應該跟隨捷克的代表乘坐返回捷克的私人包機，到達捷克之後便找方法前往倫敦。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問如何能有300萬元積蓄-李宇軒指靠寫電腦程式獲取收入&quot;&gt;官問如何能有300萬元積蓄 李宇軒指靠寫電腦程式獲取收入&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方盤問完畢之後，法官李素蘭問及李宇軒的個人背景。李稱在2019年的時候，他任職電腦程式編寫員，會接一些專案來做，有時是他一手包辦，有時他會找認識的程式編寫員一起做。李素蘭指，李宇軒在2019年時積極參與社運，有否繼續做編寫程式的工作。李確認他繼續工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李又表示，他自大學畢業起便開始任職電腦程式編寫員，至2019年僅僅接近10年，而他的主要收入來源是這份工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭問，李如何能夠儲存到300萬元銀行積蓄。李則表示閱讀銀行紀錄之後，發覺自己記錯金額，正確金額應該有逾400萬元，這是靠「做 programming 嘅錢」而累積而來。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，李到訪日內瓦的聯合國總部、法國、日本等地方，有否獲得任何資助。李稱他支付自己的機票、酒店和大部份費用，但是有部份行程的費用則是向眾籌基金報銷。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;稅單顯示李宇軒年薪達120萬元&quot;&gt;稅單顯示李宇軒年薪達120萬元&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示李宇軒在2018至2019年度的稅單，當中顯示他的年薪達120萬元，扣除強積金和免稅額後，應課稅入息實額為105萬元，應繳稅款為約14萬元。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李稱，就編寫電腦程式的工作，一開始時薪是15美元，幾個月後升至時薪40美元，後來接多了專案，時薪再慢慢升至40至50多美元，其後時薪繼續上升。李又補充，因為工作是以專案為單位，有時可以接多些專案，但有時可以沒有任何專案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李宇軒作供完畢。控方替下一名「從犯證人」陳梓華申請「提犯令」，料明日傳召他出庭作供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;executive-summary&quot;&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has led to the extensive employment of UAVs to deliver precision effects at scale. Militaries observing the conflict are assessing how they can integrate these capabilities into their own forces and mitigate the threat from them. This paper is the first in a series. It examines how UAVs offer the most utility to land forces; subsequent papers will consider counter-UAV methodologies and their role across the joint force. There are six critical conclusions that can be drawn from the present paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, UAVs’ primary offer is their ability to deliver effect at either a cost or a scale that cannot be matched by other means. This means that UAV designs should be ruthlessly simplified and optimised for defined tasks. However, there are also limits to the extent to which costs can be driven down if a system is to be reliable and resilient. There are, in fact, very particular intersections between price and capability where UAVs are optimally effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, UAVs should be treated not as platforms but as systems. Any UAV becomes increasingly ineffective over time as the adversary refines its countermeasures. Ensuring that a UAV complex can continue to function effectively requires updates to software, behavioural logic, sensors and radios, every six to 12 weeks. The airframe is the constant but least important component. UAV procurement must reflect this, with suppliers contracted to provide subsystems, not integrated packages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the effectiveness of UAVs is largely determined by their layered employment, by crew skill, and by the capacity to plan flights. The latter requires access to electromagnetic surveys, meteorological data, intelligence on enemy air defences, and awareness of other UAV activity. The need to scale effect, and to have access to a support structure that must often draw on highly classified capabilities, means that while some UAVs may be widely distributed as tactical tools, most classes of UAV are better grouped into a specialist formation that is able to use different kinds of UAV in combination, and that has the in-house capacity to update and reconfigure its UAVs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, a UAV battalion, equipped to deliver close and deep strike, deep ISR and enabling action, can support a large area of battlespace. While the capabilities they offer can pose challenges to the enemy, however, UAV effectiveness is ultimately dependent upon their interaction with artillery, electronic warfare, air defence and other force elements. UAVs may redistribute the balance of missions assigned to different systems, but they do not eliminate the requirement for traditional artillery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fifth critical conclusion is that regulation of UAVs is a major constraint upon their effective design, procurement and employment, and thus on their battlefield effectiveness. There are trade-offs between the speed of evolution necessary to keep these systems competitive and the safety requirements for airspace deconfliction. It is evident that the structures that exist in NATO countries today tend to increase cost and slow down development to such an extent as to prevent NATO states from employing UAVs effectively. The approach to regulation should be scrutinised, as it has an impact on the operational outputs of the force in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a force that is aware of and equipped to counter the threat of massed UAVs can degrade their efficiency. There are many limitations to UAVs that can be worked around through adaptive tactics. These methods are difficult to scale. However, a force that is not aware of or equipped to counter UAVs risks ceding the enemy an insurmountable advantage in situational awareness, and suffering from a scale of precision effects that will prove crippling. Armies cannot, therefore, afford to be unprepared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study addresses the question of what components are necessary for land forces to field a UAV complex that can deliver precision effects en masse to maximise the efficiency of exchange with an enemy. The study pursues this question by exploring three questions in sequence. The first chapter surveys the technological enablers of UAVs and the design trade-offs that ensue. The intent is to bound the resilience and scale of effect deliverable at a given price point. Having mapped where the utility and cost balance lies, the second chapter then explores the types of system a force must field in combination to maximise its effect. Having considered the number and type of UAV systems involved, the third chapter maps what is necessary as an enabling structure to deploy this scale of effect. The study also seeks to outline the limits of what can be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper draws on practical experimentation by the authors with most classes of military UAVs in NATO arsenals, and visits to sites and units engaged in the manufacture and testing of bespoke UAVs. The fieldwork included physical examination and technical inspection of Russian and Iranian UAVs, observation of UAV combat employment in Ukraine, and extensive interviews with manufacturers, operators, and troops responsible for countering UAVs. The authors also conducted a literature review of work on airframe design. Much of this research was undertaken in contexts where operational security or commercial sensitivity prevent direct attribution of data points in the present study. Therefore, the authors have attempted to find open-source material which replicates important data points or principles accurately where possible. This is the first study in a series: the second will outline a methodology for countering mass precision UAV strike complexes, while the third will consider how UAV and counter-UAV capabilities redistribute responsibilities and interactions across the joint force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the 1980s, precision has been at the heart of the concept of a revolution in military affairs. The efficiency of targeting using precision weapons was perceived by the Soviet Union to be as consequential for the conduct of war as the advent of nuclear weapons, while such capabilities sat at the centre of the US offset strategy during the Cold War. The volume of precision strikes that a force can deliver has, however, been constrained by the cost and complexity of these munitions, making their allocation a key prioritisation decision in operation design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advent of machine learning, miniaturised sensors and UAVs has driven widespread speculation about the ability to deliver precision strike at a previously unattainable scale. UAVs carrying small payloads, delivering munitions precisely at the most vulnerable points, across the front, have dominated visions of future war in both science fiction and military theory. Conceptually, the emphasis on precision strike has moved from limited numbers of prestige systems to cheap, attritable mass effects, especially in the land domain. These capabilities are not only presented as a novel strike system but are often touted as rendering a wide range of established military systems obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most visions of mass precision strike do little to outline the limitations of cheap and attritable platforms. Nor do most of these studies outline how such a capability may drive an adversary to adapt its dispositions and capabilities. Furthermore, much of the emphasis in the literature is on the delivery mechanism – the UAV – while very little attention is given to supporting enablers or the formations required to field UAVs at scale. These enablers create vulnerabilities in a mass precision complex that have rarely been mapped, and consequently there has been little consideration of how a mass precision complex may need to be employed in order to assure its own survivability and effectiveness. Unpacking these considerations is vital as militaries begin to invest significantly in UAV technology. In the UK, for example, the Ministry of Defence has just committed £4.5 billion to UAV acquisition, while Project Replicator in the US is set to receive several hundred million dollars’ worth of funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to bound the scope of this study. One of the enduring sources of confusion about the impact of UAVs on the battlefield is the elasticity of the word “drone”. This term is used to cover everything from hand-sized UAVs designed for scouting buildings to long-endurance high-altitude aircraft such as the RQ-4 Global Hawk, which are comparable in size to a regional airliner and cost more than $100 million each. There is a perennial tendency in the literature to describe a quadcopter costing around $2,500, and then to casually endow it with capabilities that would require processing power, battery, sensors, communications links and lift that are unlikely to be viable below a price point of around $80,000. This paper does not assume that a single airframe can achieve the range of effects required; this is why it is premised on the study of a mass precision strike complex. By “complex”, the paper means a grouping of UAV platforms that, as a system, offers a commander the ability to deliver mass precision effects. Complexes include the airframes and their payloads, and the launch crews, command links, planning tools, intelligence support and design teams required to field the capability. The precision strike complex is discussed as being formed of five UAV classes: situational awareness UAVs optimised for tactical reconnaissance; tactical strike UAVs; ISR UAVs able to penetrate into operational depth; operational strike UAVs; and platform-launched effects designed specifically to synchronise with and enable other weapons systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several systems that fall under the highly general term “drone” that are excluded from this study. This study does not examine hand-held micro-UAVs, nor does it examine remotely piloted medium-altitude long-endurance UAVs such as the MQ-9 Reaper or the Bayraktar TB2, because these are optimised for operating in uncontested airspace. The study considers expendable systems that might be launched by air forces, but does not consider full-scale loyal wingmen or uncrewed combat aerial vehicle-type platforms. Nor is this paper concerned with blue-water naval capabilities. The capabilities described are relevant to littoral naval operations, but naval engagements at sea are likely to employ UAVs in a range of bespoke roles that are beyond the scope of this study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-uav-design-trade-offs&quot;&gt;I. UAV Design Trade-offs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amass precision strike complex is not just a question of UAVs. Traditional barrel or rocket artillery will deliver precision effects, while electronic warfare (EW), geospatial and other ISR assets are fundamental to a robust reconnaissance strike complex. In theory, however, UAVs allow this complex to scale and mesh across echelons because of the ability to generate large numbers of ISR feeds and to economically deliver a high volume of precision effects, either by exploiting UAV-based ISR to make traditional artillery precise, or by delivering effects with UAVs. Given that it is the UAVs that sit at the nexus between precise and mass effect, understanding the design limitations and trade-offs inherent to UAVs is vital to grounding concepts of employment within the bounds of what is physically possible and worthwhile from a cost versus effect point of view. This chapter, therefore, details the design considerations that make up a UAV, from the airframe, propulsion and power requirements to the navigation and control mechanisms, sensors and payload.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;airframe&quot;&gt;Airframe&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The airframe for any given UAV sets both the aerodynamic parameters and many of the performance and payload parameters. There are fundamental trade-off decisions that must be made during the formative design stages of any system. The starting point is to determine the range and payload weight and size required to perform a UAV’s role in the mission set. These parameters will determine the options in terms of propulsion solutions, which in turn will impose fuel or battery capacity requirements on the airframe. Through a process called fuel match sizing – illustrated in Figure 1 – the required size of the airframe can be determined based on the fuel or battery capacity that must be carried to allow the available propulsion and aerodynamic configuration to carry the mission payload the distance and for the duration needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/OBjH5hO.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Fuel Match Sizing.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/tr/pdf/ADA192214.pdf&quot;&gt;J L Parker, “Mission Requirements and Aircraft Sizing”, in “Special Course on Fundamentals of Fighter Aircraft Design”, NATO Advisory Group for Aerospace Research and Development, AGARD Report No. 740, October 1987&lt;/a&gt;, p. 2-16.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Figure 1 shows, the range and endurance required are crucial to determining the size, configuration and cost of the platform. The more range required, the greater the weight and size of the fuel or battery packs necessary to run the motors for a sufficient length of time, and therefore the greater the size and weight of the airframe. As the size and weight of the airframe increase, the power required for sustained flight at a given level of performance will also increase, meaning that the propulsion solution will consume more power per minute and thus the fuel/battery capacity needed will further increase, driving a commensurate increase in airframe size, and so on. Thus, relatively small increases in mission payload or range requirements can drive significant increases in overall airframe size, weight and cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Airframe configuration will also depend on the range and flight performance required. Broadly speaking, rotary engine configurations such as multi-copter UAVs are significantly less efficient in terms of fuel/battery power consumption over a given range and endurance compared to fixed-wing configurations. However, they are capable of hovering in place, launching and recovering vertically in complex terrain, and making sharper turns than fixed-wing systems. Therefore, for many mission sets, the flexibility that a rotary configuration brings is worth the trade-off in endurance and payload for a given size and power. Fixed-wing configurations are more efficient in terms of how far and how long a given payload can be carried at a given price point and size. However, they also require a flat, open space to launch and recover (proportionate to the size of the platform), are unable to make sharp turns or stop and hover, and are more predictable in flight, making them easier for hostile forces to detect and engage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The airframe configuration of a traditional aircraft is a relatively fixed constraint once initially fuel-match sized and specified. The complexity of redoing aerodynamic, weight and balance, lift/drag and other calculations, and retooling factories to significantly different airframe specifications, has generally precluded major changes in size and layout once an aircraft is in production. However, recent developments in additive manufacturing and advanced machine-learning-enabled aerodynamics and flight control analysis have combined to make it easier to change airframe configurations rapidly, especially for smaller systems. In Ukraine, both sides make regular use of modular UAV components to iterate new and flexible copter-type configurations. Firms also use additive manufacturing and computer-aided design suites to print UAV airframes for fixed-wing designs and tweak internal and even wing configurations as mission requirements evolve and operational usage data is collected. Therefore, airframe designs for massed strike complex assets are likely to be significantly more flexible and adaptable even once in production than traditional aircraft or even UAVs have been over the past century. This does come at the expense of reliability and safety, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are limits to this adaptability, since changing the aerodynamics, size and payload needed for a system will unavoidably affect the power and lift required to keep the system airborne within its performance parameters. This will affect the fuel or battery power required, and so may drive further spiralling increases in required airframe power, size and ultimately cost. At a certain point, asking for just a little more range or a heavier or more power-hungry payload may drive the airframe configuration to a point where it is no longer economical to use in the quantities desired, or there may be a significant impact on platform reliability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other potentially significant airframe considerations include weather tolerances. Waterproofing for internal components to enable sustained operations in bad weather, as well as, potentially, heat dissipation or cooling features to enable payloads to function in very hot weather and de-icing features to enable winter operations, all add cost, weight and complexity. A good example of such a trade-off is where a UAV’s intakes are located. Because UAVs often fly low, in a hot, dusty environment, a dorsally mounted intake improves reliability over a ventrally mounted intake. A dorsal intake tends, however, to have reduced reliability in rainy conditions. Some companies have developed novel methods for thermal management to get around these issues, but such bespoke solutions push UAVs well outside the realm of commercial off-the-shelf components and so add significant cost. For all-weather capabilities, most airframes will need to be bespoke military designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;propulsion-and-power&quot;&gt;Propulsion and Power&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The choice of propulsion type is one of the fundamental factors that will set the boundaries of possibility for a UAV, weapon or aircraft. No matter what software or sensors an airframe is fitted with, the laws of physics will still determine the ranges, speeds and durations it can operate over, based on the amount of engine thrust available and the length of time for which this can be sustained. The three primary options for propulsion categories are propellers, jet turbines or rocket engines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Propellers provide by far the greatest efficiency in terms of the amount of distance that can be covered for a given amount of fuel or battery power. They are also the simplest and cheapest solution, meaning that for assets that are intended to be fielded in very large numbers and be truly expendable, they are often the first choice. However, they are also the slowest in terms of cruise and dash speeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Propeller solutions can be powered by either electric motors or internal combustion engines, with electric power providing quieter operation, often cheaper and simpler installation, and potentially simpler logistics. However, a study in 2020 found that for UAVs, batteries store around 260 times less power for a given weight compared with gasoline. Furthermore, this battery weight penalty for flight increases in a non-linear fashion with increases in the required range/endurance of a UAV mission. This is because, unlike fuel, which is burned over time and so decreases in weight as it is used up, spent battery packs still weigh the same as charged ones. This means that adding additional battery capacity to increase range gives less and less benefit as range increases, especially for systems that are not intended to be single-use one-way attack (OWA) assets. By contrast, combustion engines burning fuel generally involve a more complex airframe installation and make more noise but provide significantly greater potential thrust and range. As a result, for applications requiring light payloads over short ranges for limited periods, electrical power is generally the preferred solution, while the longer the required range and the heavier the payload, the more compelling combustion engines powered by fuels become.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Propeller-based propulsion solutions generally also produce a significant rotor sound signature that is easier than other forms of propulsion to detect, classify and track using passive acoustic sensors. This can be mitigated to some extent with specially designed propellers. Small and/or light rotor blades such as those found on most multi-copter UAVs also generally have significant limitations in cold weather environments due to icing problems, and at altitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second option for propulsion is jet turbines. The main attraction of a turbine solution is that it enables significantly higher airspeeds and potentially operational altitudes than propeller-based solutions. Therefore, where a system needs to cover distances quickly, a turbine propulsion solution is attractive. Depending on the design and size of the turbine, such a solution can also offer respectable fuel economy over long distances, but would still require more fuel than a propeller propulsion solution for a given range in most circumstances. Jet turbines cannot be used on purely electric platforms, and they are also significantly louder than propeller-based systems. Turbine engines are much more expensive than propeller engines, and their installation and the speeds at which they allow platforms to operate generally imply a more complex and sophisticated airframe configuration, increasing cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final propulsion option is rocket motors. These can be powered by liquid or solid fuels, although for small systems, solid fuels are preferable because of their greater stability, which enables systems to be transported and stored in a “ready to use” state. Solid-fuel rocket motors are also much simpler and cheaper than liquid-fuelled systems. Compared with both jet turbine and propeller propulsion options, rocket motors offer far greater static thrust and, therefore, much greater acceleration and top speed for a given size. However, they also burn fuel at a vastly greater rate and so only provide power for the initial few seconds of flight, leaving the platform to glide to its target from that point on using the kinetic and gravitational energy built up during launch. Rocket motor solutions offer much greater responsiveness but over a much shorter range than other propulsion options. Solid-fuel rocket motors are generally cheaper than a jet turbine propulsion solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;navigation&quot;&gt;Navigation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Precision is dependent upon accurate navigation and timing. If a UAV (or its operator) does not know where it is, then it cannot guide a munition, or itself, to an identified target unless the target is already in line of sight. The robustness of a UAV’s navigation is fundamental to its utility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ubiquitous approach to navigation is to rely on global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), including GPS, Galileo, BeiDou and GLONASS. These systems all work through a similar logic. A constellation of satellites broadcast their location with a timestamp of the emission. A receiver can measure the difference between the time at which the signal was received and the timestamp of when it was sent to establish an accurate line of bearing. By comparing four lines of bearing from different satellites, the receiver can triangulate its own relative position. The power of these navigational emissions is very low; they are, therefore, easy to receive, but also easy to jam through saturation of the frequencies used. Alternatively, adversaries can deliver false signals such that the receiver is spoofed into locating itself in an erroneous position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One partial solution to this is to receive on multiple GPS frequencies and even to have antennae scanning frequencies between GPS, BeiDou, Galileo and GLONASS, and compare the results. If the results not only vary but also diverge or converge, then the receiver can either seek to confirm which signal to trust or else revert to another mode of navigation. This increases the complexity and cost of the receiving unit. Although it is possible for an enemy force to fully jam these navigational frequencies, it will rarely jam all of them because it will often be using some of them to determine the location of its own equipment. Nevertheless, if for a limited period the threat from UAVs renders it worthwhile to deny one’s own navigation, then GNSS can be denied. To rely on this method of navigation is to make the capability hostage to the enemy’s risk calculus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The normal reversionary method is inertial navigation, enabling the UAV to plot its own location relative to a known starting position. To do this, the UAV must first know that it is being jammed and therefore assess when to revert, or else use inertial navigation with its launch point as its point of reference. The system must have a laser gyroscopic compass, a precise clock, a pitot tube measuring airspeed, and a barometric or radar altimeter to establish altitude. These requirements all add significant cost, meaning that it is difficult to produce UAVs which include such navigational capabilities and that can be sustainably expended en masse. Some of these systems – barometric altimeters, for example – are also more accurate when they are larger. In the case of barometric altimeters, a larger capacity of vacuum chamber improves sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inertial navigation systems are highly susceptible to becoming increasingly inaccurate over time, because they struggle to determine drift. It is therefore usually necessary for inertial navigation to intermittently recalibrate through external confirmation. This can be done with GNSS if it is available, with the potential for gaps in jamming, whether because of terrain or the enemy periodically lifting electronic protection. It can also be done through periodic triangulation using civilian infrastructure such as mobile phone masts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improving the reliability of location confirmation can, however, be achieved via other means. One such method is terrain recognition. If a platform has an electro-optical sensor and a pre-loaded map of the terrain over which it is flying, computer vision can be used to match the UAV’s camera view against identifiable terrain features and physical markers such as rivers, roads and forests. In some contexts, more novel navigation techniques can be employed. If a platform can roll and fly inverted, or if it has an additional electro-optical sensor facing upwards, then it can use triangulation from astronomical points of reference to confirm its position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, if a platform has a laser range finder and flies at a low and level altitude, it can compare changes in contour of the ground over time to track its progress over its pre-loaded map. Novel methods, however, are mission-specific and present significant vulnerabilities. Following terrain contours, for example, does not work if there is low cloud or if the ground is flat, featureless or snow-covered. Astral navigation is restricted to clear nights and requires medium-altitude flight. These techniques may, therefore, enable navigation for specific missions, but they are not generalisable. They also tend to be sufficiently accurate to get a munition over a target, but insufficient to strike it precisely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another very specific navigational tool, which can overcome limitations of terminal accuracy, is an emissions seeker that aligns a UAV to a particular target, such as specified radar emitters. Loitering munitions including Harpy and Harop can home in on enemy emitters and loiter when signals are lost. In this way, they can have a suppressive effect. Such capabilities, however, are optimised for limited classes of target, and are susceptible to hard counters unless paired with other threat systems that impose conflicting imperatives on an adversary. Other systems, such as radar, can be used to align a munition in terminal dive in order to strike a specified area on an object. This kind of system works at short range, and while suitable for ensuring that a system working on inertial navigation can course correct to hit a specified target during its terminal dive, it requires an additional sensor to the inertial navigation system. Each additional sensor imposes an increase in cost, complexity, size and weight. Image recognition is another solution, but unless assisted by offboard data or human oversight, it is vulnerable to decoys, camouflage and other countermeasures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The navigation methods discussed above are primarily for platforms that are designed to perform much of their navigation automatically, rather than under real-time human control. The latter requires an active command link between the UAV and the human operator during flight. For ISR platforms, such a link is necessary to offboard detections. For all UAVs, however, flying under control, with navigation conducted by a human operator, can obviate the need for the UAV to know its location. Where periodic human control in a contested electromagnetic spectrum is possible, this can also allow recalibration of inertial systems. The viability of this method is dependent upon power and the sophistication of the datalink being used to maintain control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;datalinks&quot;&gt;Datalinks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Radio frequency command links are generally only effective within line of sight, unless a relay is used. Power ultimately determines the strength of the command link and the ease with which it can be jammed. Jamming tends to affect the receiver through saturation. Thus, many UAVs can offboard data even when they are not able to receive it. For UAVs operating in tactical depth, their proximity to their controllers and the limitations on how far forward enemy jammers can be pushed makes it easier to maintain command links. For UAVs pushing into enemy territory where the receiver is closer to enemy jammers than to friendly command transmitters, this becomes problematic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The robustness of these connections depends upon the complexity of the radio employed. If a UAV has a frequency-hopping radio, rapidly moving over a sufficient portion of the spectrum, then it is difficult to jam, though interference may corrupt or degrade data being transferred. A dual-frequency receiver is often an effective way of giving some resilience without incurring the cost of a high-end frequency-hopping radio. Reliability can also be improved through directional beam riding, whereby only commands passed on a specific vector are accepted, thereby rendering jamming that is not aligned ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some specialist jamming equipment can track patterns in frequency hopping and craft bespoke interference patterns that degrade command links. One way of obviating this is to have a group of UAVs passing data to one another, with each programmed to receive on different frequency regimes. If the contents of the data include a certification of authenticity, then each UAV that successfully receives authenticated data can confirm that it has received a correct command and then relay this to other UAVs in the same formation. Another way in which UAVs can collaborate to overcome jamming, as well as extending the range of command, is to act as relays for one another, such that the command signal is emitted and received closer than the jammer is to the receiver, significantly increasing the power required by the jammer to suppress the signal. Although these kinds of techniques are viable, they depend upon sophisticated and therefore costly radios. They also rely on skilled operators to programme and set up the communications architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another form of command link that can be robust is a satellite link, since it is difficult for a jammer to achieve alignment against the antenna. Satellite links are also valuable for offboarding data over the horizon. The problem with satellite links is that they introduce significant latency into a system and are generally unsuitable for maintaining a platform under direct control. Updating orders via satellite link is viable, but continuous correction of flight surfaces is more problematic. Robust satellite links depend upon highly effective gyro-stabilisation of the antenna, and are therefore only viable on larger airframes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sensors&quot;&gt;Sensors&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sensors required for a UAV are dependent on both the effect needed when the component reaches its operational area and the navigation solution(s) being relied on to get it to that operational area. In an ideal world, the same sensor or group of sensors can be used for both, since minimising sensors required is crucial for conserving space, weight, power and computing (SWAP-C) capacity, and overall unit cost. This is not always possible, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sensors can broadly be divided by the parts of the spectrum in which they operate. The simplest and most ubiquitous sensors are electro-optical (EO) cameras. Drawing on technological innovation and cost reduction driven by the commercial mobile phone sector, even small UAVs can be cheaply equipped with high-resolution EO cameras purchased in bulk from the civilian market. Advanced optical systems with high levels of magnification rely on more complex lens and stabilisation/vibration dampening technologies to be effective. Therefore, the greater the stand-off range and altitudes that an optical sensor needs to be effective over, the more expensive, large and costly it will be. Another major driver of cost, size and complexity is the need for flexible, trainable mountings, as opposed to fixed camera mounts in an airframe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Related to EO sensors are infra-red (IR) cameras, which use thermal imaging and can function in low light conditions. IR sensors can either be standalone or integrated into multispectral cameras that combine EO and IR capabilities. Both are more costly than basic EO cameras. However, if a UAV is to operate at night, the cameras must either be IR-capable, or the system must be modular and able to accept either an EO or an IR sensor fit – either way, complexity and cost increase. Image-intensifying capabilities, which take an EO sensor and maximise its performance in low light, can extend a UAV’s utility into the night, but will struggle when there is minimal ambient light. Both EO and IR cameras offer notable advantages for smaller UAVs. They require limited power to operate and are passive. They do not rely on emitting electromagnetic energy to function and so do not risk giving away the presence of the platform to hostile passive sensors when used. They are also difficult to jam, although they are vulnerable to camouflage measures and potentially to defensive laser-based systems that can use retro-reflection to detect cameras, or dazzle or damage the optical sensors. EO and IR cameras also do not work through clouds, fog, snow or heavy rain. Therefore, UAVs cannot exclusively rely on cameras if the complex that they are part of needs an all-weather capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another category of sensor is radio detection and ranging (radar). Radar can be subdivided into passive and active systems, and by the frequency band that each system is designed to operate in. In general, the higher the frequency and shorter the wavelength a radar operates at, the higher resolution it can offer, but the shorter its effective range for any given power level. Longer-wavelength systems also require larger apertures to function effectively, and so most radar sensors small enough to be mounted on a UAV will be higher-frequency, shorter-range systems. Passive radar systems only have the ability to “listen” for reflected radar energy from external emitters, while active radar systems broadcast and then “listen for” the returns from their own energy. The latter is more flexible and reliable, but allows for tracking of the UAV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For UAVs, radars are often used for synthetic aperture radar mapping, where active radar signals are emitted and the returns from all ground objects and terrain are used to build up a radar “image” of an area. Radars can also be used for detection of other airborne objects, and for terrain mapping for navigation in any weather. Some advanced weapons and OWA UAV designs also use millimetric radar seekers to scan for and provide pinpoint terminal guidance against vehicles and other reflective targets. This allows weapons to perform automatic target search and guidance, but at a significant cost and complexity premium. In general, the biggest benefit of radar-based sensors is that they work equally well in bad weather or at night, while the disadvantages include greatly increased power and cooling requirements, as well as significant cost. For sensing at long range using radar – for example, for stand-off ISR – the power and aperture size required limits such sensors to being carried by fairly large, complex and expensive airframes such as the RQ-4 Global Hawk, most of which are not survivable in contested airspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Passive radars and electronic and signals intelligence (ELINT/SIGINT) sensors require significantly less power to operate than active radars and can often be mounted in more flexible ways to suit different airframe configurations. However, they still require the capacity to conduct complex signal analysis and processing functions on the platform, or the ability to pass the raw returns data back to a ground station or other airborne asset for offboard exploitation and processing. This ensures that a capable passive radar or ELINT/SIGINT sensor payload requirement will increase the SWAP-C, cost and complexity for a given system well beyond those of an EO/IR sensor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it is worth mentioning lasers as a joint sensor/effector capability. Lasers are most commonly employed for precise ranging, for designation of targets for strikes with laser-guided weapons, and increasingly, for directional, high-bandwidth line-of-sight communications. They are generally incorporated into an EO/IR sensor as an additional component within the optics, but generate additional requirements for power and cooling when in operation. They also entail additional cost, since EO/IR sensors that incorporate a laser designator/rangefinder are more expensive and larger than basic cameras, and come with additional stabilisation and tracking requirements. There is also a processing demand generated by the logic that aligns the laser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;effectors&quot;&gt;Effectors&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is little point in building a mass precision strike complex without the ability to deliver suitable effectors to the target area. Effectors are divided into two primary categories: kinetic; and non-kinetic. For kinetic effectors, there are three primary classes of warhead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first of these are general-purpose warheads that rely on a combination of high-explosive blast and fragmentation effects to kill personnel and damage structures. HE-FRAG-type warheads have lethality that scales linearly with size against soft targets such as unarmoured vehicles, personnel and civilian structures. For small multi-copter UAVs, HE-FRAG payloads are roughly the size of a hand grenade and have a lethal radius of several metres, but offer little destructive effect against buildings. They can be effective against vehicles, but only if delivered accurately into hatches or on to fuel tanks or ammunition. Meanwhile, a roughly 200 kg OWA UAV such as a Shahed-136 can carry a warhead of up to 50.2 kg of various types, including thermobaric payloads. This can have destructive effects against non-hardened buildings and offers a lethal radius of tens of metres and the ability to reliably damage lightly armoured vehicles with near misses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second major category of kinetic effectors are shaped-charge warheads designed for anti-armour use. These use a small explosive charge to project a focused jet of molten copper that can penetrate through thick armour plating, creating red-hot fragments that kill crew and ignite fuel or ammunition stored inside a vehicle. These types of effectors are also known as explosively formed penetrators, or EFPs. Shaped charges enable relatively light warheads to destroy well-protected armoured vehicles, including main battle tanks (MBTs), if they hit the right sections at a relatively flat angle. In Ukraine, these effectors have been demonstrated by the large-scale use of small first-person view (FPV) racing quadcopters fitted with modified 2 kg RPG-7 warheads as short-ranged OWA UAVs. The downside of shaped-charge warheads is that they have very limited blast and fragmentation effects compared with simple HE-FRAG warheads, rendering them less effective against personnel or buildings for a given weight of explosive. They are also more expensive. A specialised subset of shaped-charge warheads are two-stage warheads: some of these combine an initial charge designed to penetrate either armour or buried structures with a follow-on HE-FRAG charge that bursts inside, while in others, the primary charge is designed to set off reactive armour in order to enable a second shaped charge to defeat the main armour of well-protected modern armoured vehicles. These are more complex, and thus more expensive, than single-stage shaped-charge warheads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third type of kinetic effectors are multirole warheads. These are increasingly common on high-end missiles and loitering munitions that need to be able to destroy a wide range of different targets. Such weapons typically use a dual-stage design, with a penetrating shaped charge as a primary stage and a compact HE-FRAG second stage. These warheads have much in common with two-stage penetrating warheads but are conceptually designed with anti-armour/anti-personnel/anti-structure mission flexibility in mind, rather than the ability to specifically penetrate either buried structures or vehicles protected by reactive armour layers. Like two-stage warheads, they are much more expensive than either HE-FRAG or single-stage shaped-charge warheads and are used when the economies of scale of ordering large volumes of a single multipurpose weapon are perceived to outweigh the additional cost of the warhead itself. The latter relationship is important to understand when examining the multirole utility of a mass precision strike capability. The requirement to be used en masse and thus be affordable conflicts directly with the very significant warhead costs per platform associated with true multitarget flexibility. Multirole warheads also necessarily have a lesser effect on most individual target sets than an appropriate single-role warhead of the same weight. Therefore, for small UAVs or other payload-constrained systems, the additional warhead weight for a given explosive or penetrating effect of designing a single warhead with multitarget flexibility may impose an unacceptable trade-off against fuel/battery capacity and range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-kinetic effectors are, largely, EW payloads designed to degrade hostile sensors, either through noise jamming or through more sophisticated signal timing manipulation or protocol-based electronic attack techniques. The advantage of deploying such payloads forward into hostile terrain on UAVs is that the physics governing radar and communications signals mean that effective jamming requires greatly diminished power input the closer the emitter can be placed to the target receiver, and the better it can be aligned to the centre of the target sensor array. The drawbacks of EW payloads are that they are more complex and expensive than kinetic warheads, require significant onboard power generation and cooling to operate for any sustained period, and rely on up-to-date mission data files and signal coding to be effective. They may still be relatively efficient and effective for larger systems being used as part of, for example, a suppression of enemy air defences campaign, where the alternatives are cruise missiles. However, EW payloads tend to be much more expensive than most kinetic effectors used in UAVs in support of the land fight. This constrains their use to complex and survivable platforms, and means that their effectiveness against hostile sensors will diminish rapidly in any conflict once used, as the enemy adapts its countermeasures to nullify the jamming. Therefore, while the airframe to carry an EW payload could be made relatively cheaply, the payloads themselves will be not only expensive but also sensitive. Furthermore, such payloads are reliant on a complex and expensive national ELINT/SIGINT collection, analysis and mission data file generation apparatus to create and rapidly update the signals that they use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;regulation&quot;&gt;Regulation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although not part of the core design trade-offs in a UAV as a platform, regulation has an outsized impact on design choices and whether the system that produces UAVs is fit for purpose. Because early UAVs were predominantly large airframes with significant range and endurance, the certification of UAVs developed from the process that regulates aircraft. As the speed of UAV development accelerates, in terms of alterations to payload configuration, navigational logic, command link resilience and airframe, the assurance work needed to guarantee that a UAV will reliably function without crashing or deviating from its anticipated behaviour increases. Assurance of the system’s reliability not only imposes time on the development process but also expands the platform cost, both to conduct the trials and to take on the risk of designing a UAV that may not be certified, thereby delaying the sequencing of design and investment in production capacity. There is, therefore, a trade-off between safety and cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another consideration is regulation’s indirect impact on doctrine. Safety has often imposed strict airspace management on how UAVs are integrated into exercises. The greater these constraints, however, the less realistic is the use of UAVs during training compared with their actual employment on the battlefield. Since organisations will shape themselves to solve the problems they encounter as regards novel technology, it follows that communications procedures, command relationships and other structural components of a mass precision complex will be heavily shaped by how regulation allows UAVs to be employed on exercise. The level of risk a state is prepared to accept as regards air safety in order to enable realistic training will therefore determine the extent to which UAV formations will need to be restructured in war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final point about regulation concerns targeting. Many of the methods for making strike UAVs more robust involve the use of autonomous target recognition. Even for ISR UAVs, object recognition is a valuable means of accelerating the targeting cycle. In principle, anti-tank mines, anti-radiation missiles and missiles with active seekers such as Brimstone are all autonomous weapons. The novelty of this should not be overstated. However, the capacity for UAVs to fly significant distances in different directions introduces safety considerations for autonomy that are more easily mitigated with older weapons. Furthermore, declarations that states expect a “human in the loop” impose very significant constraints upon how UAVs can function. The regulation of data, assurance, and the algorithms that process the data all impose cost and time restrictions on the adaptability of UAVs. These processes therefore have tangible military consequences, especially if they are underpinned by international agreements or law, rather than policy that can be adapted in the event of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The various components that make up a UAV, outlined above, highlight how there are significant trade-offs involved in designing a UAV for a given mission. There is also the challenge of scaling a capability that may have a limited period of maximum utility before the adversary can map its characteristics and field hard counters. Furthermore, many of the constraints outlined above demonstrate why endeavouring to do too much with a UAV either risks preventing it from being fielded at scale or actually increases its vulnerability. Yet UAVs that are not sophisticated will often struggle to sustain the delivery of effects in the way that traditional strike systems can. This places a premium on the ability to align UAV designs to their tasks, and taking a ruthless approach to simplifying the platform. It is this matching of capabilities to tasks that is covered in the next chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-assembling-the-complex&quot;&gt;II. Assembling the Complex&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having considered the trade-offs in UAV design, it becomes possible to outline the key mission sets that different components of a mass precision strike complex may be designed to carry out in support of land operations. In turn, analysis of these tasks can help determine the cost, complexity, volume and parameters of the UAVs required to deliver these missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mission-sets&quot;&gt;Mission Sets&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be worth investing in at scale, a mass precision strike complex must deliver precision effects against a sufficient volume of targets to disrupt or degrade the enemy’s capacity to competitively fight. This task may be broken down into five mission sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first mission set is ISR in the close fight, over the battlespace occupied by an equivalent echelon to the formation in contact. The requirement is to provide tactical formations with persistent visibility of the battlespace in order to coordinate traditional fires, or to call in mass precision strikes on identified targets. Density of sensor coverage is a key driver of capability here, as is the ability for these assets to operate from tactical formations without absorbing disproportionate cognitive load from a section or platoon. As these systems must operate persistently, little can be done to shape or route-plan where they will operate. Consequently, they will be required to fly in heavily contested airspace without shaping effects being sequenced to reduce threats prior to launch. It must therefore be assumed that these platforms will be lost in large numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second mission set is to deliver precision strikes in volume in the close. This primarily involves strikes on groups of armoured fighting vehicles, firing positions, and communications equipment. The number of targets for a strike will vary, but could number as many as 12 platforms. Range requirements likely sit at up to 10 km of depth from the forward line of own troops (FLOT), requiring an effective range of approximately 20 to 30 km to be able to launch from a safe distance behind the FLOT and cover a sufficient arc of battlespace. Targets are highly likely to be mobile and time-sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third mission set comprises over-the-horizon reconnaissance against targets in the deep battle area. The range requirement would cover the enemy’s close-support artillery and reconnaissance-fires system, requiring approximately 80 km to be traversed from point of launch. Maximum penetration range is likely constrained by transit speed as much as fuel, since beyond a certain distance many longer-range effectors will no longer be able to reliably reach targets before they have displaced. Static targets, identifiable by other means of detection such as geospatial or electromagnetic reconnaissance, are not the primary targets for these systems. Instead, the object is to precisely locate enemy artillery, air defence, and command and control infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fourth mission set comprises long-range strikes against operationally significant targets. Ranges may be up to 500 km, and targets could include tactical systems or fixed targets such as airfields or occupied structures of military utility. Owing to limitations on the weight that can be carried such distances by systems cheap enough to be used en masse, targets are unlikely to include hardened infrastructure, which would remain the preserve of larger and more expensive cruise and ballistic missiles. Given the long transit time implied by travelling so far from the point of launch, long-range strikes in this fourth mission set would require careful mission planning and would not involve dynamic targets. However, by offering a persistent threat of precision strike against logistical infrastructure and command and control elements, these capabilities would add significant friction to the enemy’s ability to resupply and coordinate forces, and therefore to achieve concentration. These capabilities also represent a concern for air and naval forces insofar as they threaten infrastructure and basing. The planning involved means that strikes will prioritise operationally significant and therefore defended targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final mission set comprises enablement of joint strike. This could be by providing airborne communications relays for other UAVs. It could also involve the delivery of loitering EW effects to degrade defences and enable them to be bypassed by more capable strike systems. A key variable in the design of such enablers is the speed of engagement for the strike that is being enabled, since this will determine the duration that the effector will need to be on target and the time it has to reach that point. Without a complicated kill chain, it may also require commonality of launch platform with the effector that the platform is enabling, and such commonality is not guaranteed. For example, penetration aids dispensed by cruise missiles will quickly be left behind by the munition. A UAV loitering over defensive systems, by contrast, can present defensive radar with a persistent variety of false targets throughout the duration of a cruise missile engagement, increasing the probability of a successful strike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;close-isr&quot;&gt;Close ISR&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core mission for close ISR is to provide persistent and widespread coverage for units in the close fight. Units that have uncompetitive situational awareness are liable to suffer disproportionately in engagements. The rough requirement is for each platoon to be able to generate two UAVs. The platforms must be attritable because they are needed in a confined battlespace and are required to fly irrespective of the level of EW interference – this means that they will be lost in large numbers. Since the operator cannot select the time and place of their use, and because many of them are needed, the platforms must be as cheap and simple to operate as possible, as well as having a low logistical burden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A rotary system is the most efficient design. Since the system will likely need to be carried by dismounted personnel, a target weight below 2 kg is optimal. The platform must be usable during the day and at night, and able to identify targets in cover, meaning that a thermal optic is highly desirable – this is likely to be the most expensive component of the UAV, followed by its antenna and battery. Overall, the target price is likely to be below $2,500 per airframe, in order to enable militaries to procure the UAVs in sufficiently large numbers for training and operations as disposable assets akin to munitions. Some units that anticipate operating with a lower signature and which need greater environmental assurance will likely see the price point for their UAVs rise to $8,000 per unit. The rough flight requirements are for 40 minutes’ endurance and an operating range of approximately 10 km. The cost target required to sustainably field these systems as expendable massed assets imposes limitations in terms of being able to incorporate EW resilience and non-GPS-dependent navigation and other features discussed in Chapter I. To make investing in more expensive systems affordable, the anticipated attrition rates and thus numbers required would need to be commensurately lower. Large-scale, as opposed to ad hoc, procurement may help drive prices down, thanks to economies of scale that allow vendors to manufacture more cost effectively, but this approach also makes rapid design iteration to stay ahead of enemy adaptation more difficult. One of the simplest means of increasing survivability is to make sure that the UAV utilises a different control frequency for each flight, thus requiring the adversary to identify the frequency before its EW can attack the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Command and control for such a system must be hands-off, because the operator is liable to be distracted by threats to their person. The platform requires the ability to maintain its position, likely by fixing itself above a visually identified point on the ground. The presumption should be that the platform is able to operate without GPS, as this will be routinely denied. The best means of achieving this is probably for the platform to measure its distance and bearing from the control station, certified as genuine through a mission-specific pre-loaded encryption key. Commands can thereafter be given to the system to move a specified distance in three dimensions, or to fly under direct control. The determination of locations of detected objects would likely be achieved by the operator based on alignment of the images with their own map. Given the need to keep the cost of the platform to a minimum, object recognition and other AI-enabled capabilities would likely be cost-prohibitive on these platforms. The optimal behaviour of the UAV if it were to lose connectivity for a sustained period would be to fly towards its last-detected direction of certified command for a comparable distance to the assessed range to the emitter, and then land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present there is no competitive alternative to the products of DJI, the Chinese manufacturer that dominates the market in small civilian uncrewed aerial systems (UAS). Comparable products are manufactured by NATO members, but not at a competitive price for quality. The basic reason for this is that because DJI has cornered the global civilian market, it has economies of scale in production that reduce its prices – as well as having had heavy financial support from the Chinese government. In this way, NATO’s civilian market is directly subsidising the development of People’s Liberation Army military systems. To compete, NATO members must first increase the order volumes on a smaller selection of UAVs and enable the progressive refinement of designs. Second, it is necessary to allow sale of simplified products but with substantial parts commonality on the civilian market. Systems produced by Western vendors must be modular in design and support upgrades of certain components such as processors, sensors and radios, in order to allow initial vendor production and military procurement ramp-up to take place without resulting in obsolete equipment too quickly, and to allow for a fast pace of innovation. Without these measures, assured Western access to the necessary production volumes of UAVs in this class at a viable price point is precarious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;close-strike&quot;&gt;Close Strike&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core of this mission set is to provide the joint force with a means to degrade the fighting effectiveness and ideally halt the movement of hostile forces before they can close to within direct-fire weapons range of friendly forces. This could be achieved by destroying significant numbers of either key enablers in depth; close-support artillery and other support platforms such as vehicles extending electronic protection to advancing forces; or manoeuvre elements. Since movement of effective fighting formations over tens of kilometres tends to be vehicle dependent, most of the key target sets that must be struck to accomplish this task will be armoured vehicles. This class of massed strike assets is more likely to be required to launch on detection of targets, rather than loiter for extended periods. This is because the mission requires a large number of weapons to arrive in a short period of time, to rapidly degrade formations as they advance and to overwhelm point defence systems. It is also because the armoured nature of many key targets, particularly hostile MBTs, means that a shaped-charge warhead must be carried.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To degrade the effectiveness and/or stall the advance of enemy formations, catastrophic kills on vehicles are unnecessary; damage sufficient to immobilise a majority of the vehicles present should suffice. Combat experience in Ukraine suggests that this level of damage is reliably achievable with relatively light and cheap massed OWA UAVs such as the Russian Lancet-3M with a 5 kg shaped-charge warhead. Once vehicles have been damaged sufficiently by hits to their engines, running gear or other key components, they will become stationary targets for artillery or other less specialised massed fires components such as FPV drones. Thus, in conjunction with other capabilities, the critical task for mass precision strike effects in the close is to be able to immobilise most of the tanks and armoured fighting vehicles in a hostile company-sized formation before they can close to within direct-fire range (approximately 2.5 km away from the FLOT). If this can be achieved in a manner that is significantly more cost effective and efficient than massed artillery or attack aviation, then it is likely to represent a compelling investment case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A standard Russian tank company in a battalion has 10 MBTs, while a standard motor rifle company has between two and four MBTs and between six and eight infantry fighting vehicles or armoured personnel carriers. Therefore, as a planning assumption, stopping a company-sized assault requires the ability to reliably immobilise or otherwise mission-kill four to six armoured vehicles, which are often equipped with explosive reactive armour. The number of precision effectors required will depend on the terminal survivability of the weapon, the effectiveness of the warhead, and the accuracy and robustness of the weapon’s guidance/control system. Increasing the speed of flight by using a small turbojet rather than a propeller will increase response times between launch and impact, and potentially make the weapon harder to intercept, but will increase cost and thus reduce the number that can be procured and launched for a given budget; it will also reduce terminal manoeuvrability. The same can be said for warhead effectiveness – a larger or tandem warhead will give greater probability of mission-killing an armoured vehicle for each hit, but it will also necessitate a larger, more powerful airframe/propulsion configuration, which will increase cost and thus reduce affordable mass of munitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give a sense of the cost boundaries, an FPV UAV with an anti-tank grenade attached to it may have a unit price of approximately $800 to $1,800. However, operational data from Ukraine demonstrates that only approximately one in five of these munitions reaches a target, because of the manufacturing quality and reliability, the pilot skills required and the effect of EW on their control channels. Indeed, there are large parts of the day when EW means that FPVs simply cannot be used. FPVs also have an unreliable effect on armoured targets, requiring multiple hits to kill. Moreover, because of their short range – made even shorter in cold temperatures – and the problems associated with spectrum crowding in cheap FPVs due to simple, low-quality radios, it is difficult to concentrate FPVs. Ukrainian FPV teams often need to disperse 500 m apart to avoid spectrum interference. There are more advanced FPV systems emerging, which are more reliable and have higher hit ratios, but cost in the region of $3,000. FPVs nevertheless remain tools that are primarily effective when the enemy decides to accept the risk from them by turning off jamming. They are a useful section-level tool, able to deliver precise effects from cover, but are not a sufficiently reliable system to form a core capability in a mass precision strike complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a weapon such as the Lancet-3M, which has a fairly reliable effect on targets that are not protected by reactive armour, and is guided by a cheap FPV control system that operates on a dual frequency and a reserve frequency to complicate jamming, the destruction of the target might be reasonably accomplished by launching between two and three weapons per target. With object designation allowing for autonomous terminal homing, the Lancet-3M can also reduce its vulnerability to interference once it is descending upon its target. With a range of approximately 35 km, Lancets can converge from multiple axes, and their size allows them to carry an antenna to interface with relay UAVs that significantly complicate attempts to jam their control frequencies. Thus, to stop a company-strength Russian formation with around 10 armoured vehicles, the launch of 20 Lancet-3M type effectors should be enough. Given a publicly available cost estimate for a Lancet-3M of $30,000, on munitions expenditure alone, this would suggest a cost of around $600,000 to achieve the mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For comparison, the US-made FGM-148 Javelin has a cost per missile of around $170,000, with a range of between 1,200 m and 4,000 m depending on conditions, while the AGM-179 Joint Air-to-Ground Missile (JAGM) is being offered to the British Army’s AH-64E Apache fleet at up to $319,000 per missile. In practice, the price of the JAGM is likely to be closer to $200,000. The cost of these two weapons reflects their additional speed, range, terminal accuracy and warhead complexity, giving them a probability of kill that is close to one, even against heavily armoured targets, though there are bespoke countermeasures that can be used to reduce this. A Lancet-style munition with a warhead comparable to a dedicated air-to-ground missile, a rocket motor to complicate interception and a more robust command link is technically feasible; however, such a design would be similar to the existing Israeli SPIKE NLOS anti-tank missile, reaching a price point of around $200,000 if it is to have comparable range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outlining these cost point and capability benchmarks is important, because the public discourse surrounding UAVs often takes its cost assumptions from FPVs, but ascribes to them the capabilities of a Lancet, with the further enhancements of networked AI. This is unrealistic. Operational analysis is clear that while FPVs are a useful infantry weapon and additional tool, they are not reliable or dependable, and their effects do not currently scale. Moreover, a more capable UAV in the price range of existing air-to-ground missiles is likely rather redundant. However, Lancet-style UAVs deliver air-to-ground-missile-like effects at much greater range. They are easier to counter, but flexible enough to be employed when the necessary countermeasures are not in place. They are also a large enough munition to be upgraded with some modularity. The aim, therefore, should be for a munition with around 30 km range, carrying a 5 kg warhead, manufactured at a price point below $40,000 per unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;deep-isr&quot;&gt;Deep ISR&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to fly and loiter in depth requires an airframe with a fixed wing and an endurance, with its necessary payload, of approximately 2.5 hours. If we assume a minimum 30-minute loiter time in the target area to identify relevant targets at a maximum depth of 70 km – determined by the maximum range of effectors available in quantity – then this would leave 120 minutes to cover up to 90 km of battlespace, including the distance behind the FLOT from which the platform is launched. If the system is to remain capable of this in moderate-to-high winds of 25 knots gusting 40 knots, with an assumption that this may be a headwind, and that the benefit of the tailwind on the return flight is taken to maintain the loiter, this requires the platform to be able to cover approximately 250 km of distance in 120 minutes, producing a target airspeed of 125 km/h. Smaller platforms may be suitable for supporting tube artillery units, given their limited range, but this constitutes a reasonable maximum requirement for an ISR UAV. The resultant airframe is likely to have a wingspan of approximately 4 m and be driven by a propeller, not least because it must be able to loiter efficiently at low speeds while over the target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of sensors, ISR UAVs need EO/IR sensors. These must be gyro-stabilised to counteract vibration in order to be clear even when zoomed in. The platform must also have the ability to offboard information on detected targets. There is a design choice between a platform that conducts object recognition using its own sensors and offboards merely the classification and position of observed objects, as compared with one that offboards full-motion video. The former is significantly more complicated but resilient, while the latter pushes the analytical burden onto the receiver and requires a persistent link, which is targetable by adversary EW assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deep ISR platforms are likely to be required to operate in a GPS-denied environment, and if they are to obtain an accurate fix on targets, they must also be able to determine the precise position of an identified object despite denial of navigational signals. The most likely method to achieve this is inertial navigation supported by periodic updates from terrain recognition working from pre-loaded maps. This could be overlaid with an updated calibration from a control station using an elevated narrow-beam transmission. Offboarding data would most reliably be achieved via satellite link, or a directional antenna using a software- defined radio. The ability to precisely locate target objects for strikes by other assets would likely require a laser rangefinder to calculate bearing and distance from its own position in order to obtain an accurate grid reference. Some advanced systems can calculate an accurate position of a camera impact point using high-fidelity terrain maps, slant range calculations and terrain feature matching – however, these capabilities depend on relatively complex components on the UAV to provide it with the required onboard data points. A target located by a UAV using these means could then be compared with the fixed location of the visual image in identified maps for verification purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The requirement to maintain coverage over areas of interest means that it would be necessary to deploy concurrent orbits, such that a unit of action of these UAVs would need to comprise three airframes. The expensive components would be the software-defined radio, the processing power to store and interrogate the pre-loaded map, and the sensor ball. Collectively, these are likely to bring a unit cost of up to $200,000 per airframe. Survivability would not just depend upon the relatively small radar cross-section of the platform and its slow flight but also on careful route planning. Persistent high-fidelity reconnaissance in this depth is not a mission that other capabilities reliably offer. Attempting to achieve similar effects with crewed rotary aviation is prohibitively risky. Furthermore, while a unit cost of $200,000 may sound expensive, it compares favourably with the kinds of air defence munitions that would be used to endeavour to intercept this class of UAV. As an enabler of reconnaissance and strike, such a capability is therefore probably the easiest to justify as a stand-alone capability, with minimal overlap with other means of collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a strong tendency with these platforms to complicate them by expanding the effects they can offer. The argument is that since the system can arrive over targets, why not enable it to prosecute them itself? The short answer is that munitions are heavy, and their carriage would significantly increase drag. The result would be a substantially larger platform and in practice this would see a spiralling increase in cost, with a corresponding decrease in survivability. This is why strike-capable UAVs with these ranges rapidly see costs rise into the millions of dollars, such as Turkey’s TB2. Beyond a more favourable rate of exchange, such UAVs also begin to expose themselves more to threat systems; additionally, command and control at such depth is difficult to ensure, increasing the requirements for autonomy and further increasing cost and complexity. On balance, it usually makes sense to separate ISR from strike if the aim is to keep the airframe light and cheap, and to maximise volume of the capability at a price point that prohibits many adversary systems from risking illumination to prioritise engaging them. The separation of UAVs into task modules is a common architectural approach known as “separation of concerns”, and it delivers a more modular, resilient complex of systems that is more survivable than a monolithic module. A significant exception to this is where the UAV can carry non-kinetic payloads. Using its software-defined radio, if mounting a suitable antenna, such a UAV can collect both ELINT and SIGINT, or be a vector for electronic attack. Modularity of payload makes this an option, but it would not be a routine mission set, not least because the effects would be bespoke. New systems are constantly being developed by NATO nations, and consequently smaller ELINT and SIGINT devices are emerging, meaning that the weight penalty of such capabilities is decreasing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;deep-strike&quot;&gt;Deep Strike&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to reach and strike targets in strategic depth with a mass precision strike complex offers the potential to add to enemy operational-level dilemmas, and to combine a range of new effects with existing but contested air force mission sets. The transit times inherent in long-range strike over hundreds of kilometres make it impractical to target mobile assets in a dynamic way using such systems. Thus, in terms of navigation complexity, a system only has to be capable of navigating accurately to a pre-planned location. As detailed in Chapter I, there are many different approaches to this challenge, with cost and complexity increasing significantly if the system needs to be able to operate independently of GPS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To travel hundreds of kilometres into enemy territory, systems must carry significant fuel reserves, a robust automated navigation system, and a sizeable warhead to allow them to have an effect on targets commensurate with their cost. This means that even systems optimised for cost efficiency over speed or sophistication, such as the first generations of the propeller-driven Iranian Shahed-136, cost upwards of $30,000 and weigh around 200 kg. Russia has significantly hardened and upgraded the platform over several iterations, but has also brought the production cost up to around $80,000. Thus, the targets that are being attacked in strategic depth will generally be deliberately targeted according to a centralised process, rather than being selected ad hoc. Moreover, whereas tactical engagements can be rapidly exploited, effects in strategic depth generally take weeks, months or even years to have a decisive effect on an opposing state’s capacity to fight. All the while, defence systems and tactics will adapt, meaning that simply massing a single type of long-range strike effector is unlikely to generate decisive effects before defensive tactics evolve to mitigate its ability to reach targets reliably. Instead, the navigation, guidance and terminal behaviour of mass long-range strike systems will need to iterate to stay ahead of hostile defence system adaptation during a campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of strike methodologies, the two approaches visible in Ukraine (used by both sides) are dispersed targeting with single platforms, and massed salvos to overwhelm defences at key defended sites. The mission requirements for dispersed targeting with single platforms are simple and can consequently be met with comparatively cheap effectors. With the 50 kg warheads that can be carried by affordable propeller-driven systems such as Shahed-136, accuracy to within several metres is required for reliable destructive effects on specific facilities or installations. With this accuracy, however, it is possible to supplement the destructive effects of a wider long-range strike campaign by using cheap precision strike effectors to hit targets that are not valuable enough to warrant using an expensive cruise missile or penetrating air strike, but still add to national warfighting and logistics capacity. This will force an opposing force to either spread out air defences, reducing coverage at critical sites, or accept significant attrition and/or logistics inefficiency over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second strike methodology is to mass deep strike effectors with systems launched and mission planned to arrive at a more valuable and heavily defended target simultaneously. This requires complex mission planning, navigation and potentially datalink capabilities, if weapons are to coordinate their behaviour as a swarm in flight. These attributes raise unit cost, and also reduce the number of such strike operations that can be conducted in any given span of time with a given amount of resources. However, use of relatively affordable long-range precision effects en masse can present opponents with serious air defence dilemmas in terms of terminal lethality and interceptor missile consumption over time if used as part of a wider deep strike campaign alongside more traditional assets. The systems likely to be affordable at scale in a sustained way will probably not have complex radar cross-section reduction features or defensive aids suites, or be capable of complex or very high-speed terminal flight behaviour. This ensures that they are individually relatively easy to shoot down using conventional short-ranged air defence (SHORAD) systems such as Gepard, Tor or Pantsir. However, the threat that they can pose if allowed to get through to fixed logistics infrastructure, airbases, maintenance depots or other fixed nodes means that air defences must engage them. If enough arrive at once, some may get through due to defensive systems being overwhelmed or running short of ready-to-fire interceptor ammunition. If used to directly attack defensive systems, or launched alongside aerial decoys that complicate the positioning of air defences, such saturation attacks can also improve the mission success rates for more expensive and scarce cruise missiles or penetrating combat aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The potential of massed long-range precision strike effectors to be used as a key enabler for a wider strategic air and missile strike campaign would be greatly increased if the effectors were able to actively target air and missile defence systems. However, this requires active seekers, since most modern air defence systems are at least semi-mobile and will frequently reposition between different pre-set locations even when defending a fixed site. EO/IR seekers with sufficient processing power behind them to recognise, categorise and home in on air defence assets, or more sophisticated anti-radiation homing or millimetric radar seekers, are all technically possible additions to a long-range precision strike platform. However, all will greatly increase the cost to many times the figures associated with more basic fixed-target coordinate-attack systems such as Shahed-136. The efficient propeller or even small turbojet powerplants that can provide sufficient range in a relatively compact and affordable platform also limit the terminal survivability of such systems. Therefore, given that most Russian air defence systems are capable of intercepting much more challenging targets, such as AGM-88 HARM missiles, large numbers of propeller or jet-powered effectors would be needed to have a high probability of kill against aware air defence systems. At that point, it may become less competitive, in terms of cost, than simply investing a similar amount of money in increasing stocks of existing air-launched munitions natures designed for destruction of enemy air defences. A cheaper option would be for ISR UAVs to designate targets for terminal guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering these trade-offs, therefore, the value of a long-range precision strike capability appears most evident either in being able to strike targets that do not in themselves justify the exposure or expenditure of more capable assets, or in how they contribute to complex strikes. In both cases, it is cheapness and simplicity that ultimately differentiate these systems, and so the target should be to design and acquire a point attack system with a unit cost below $100,000 that is sufficiently modular to allow its navigational logic to be altered and adapted to stay ahead of adversary hard counters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;enabling-effects&quot;&gt;Enabling Effects&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a range of enabling effects likely to form part of the requirement set for a mass precision strike complex. The most obvious of these are communications and datalink relay assets, EW effectors, and decoys. In all cases, the mission requires a platform able to carry a sophisticated electronics payload, with the requisite power and cooling to enable its operation and sufficient power and fuel to keep it airborne at the required depth for a sustained period of time. Therefore, this category of assets is likely to be larger and more expensive than precision strike in the close or even over-the-horizon ISR classes. These assets are also likely to be fixed-wing and propeller-driven to enable slow, aerodynamically efficient flight at several thousand feet in order to provide good lines of sight to the various systems they are designed to interact with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For datalink/communications relay functions, the key parameters are likely to be endurance on station, signal transmission range and bandwidth capacity of onboard processors, and a modern digital software-defined radio suite with frequency agility to make it harder for hostile forces to degrade its functionality when the rest of the complex is operating. The payload is, therefore, likely to be significantly more valuable than the airframe and engine combination of the platform, and will represent the cost and manufacturing bottleneck for deployable numbers. However, since relay UAVs can generally operate back from the target location(s) being engaged by kinetic components of the complex, they are unlikely to be regular targets for kinetic engagements, and so are less likely to be lost in large numbers. However, the value of their payloads means that this class of UAV will need a robust automatic navigation and safe landing/recovery function to avoid being overly vulnerable to hostile electronic attack. The number of relay UAVs required, and their centrality to the functioning of a mass precision strike complex, will ultimately be determined by the level of automation built into other elements of the system. The more automated the search and strike functions of the complex are at various operational depths, the less reliance on very low-latency assured datalink connectivity there will be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For EW effectors as part of a mass precision strike complex, platform size and power generation limitations are likely to require a stand-in approach, rather than a stand-off one. Due to the way that electromagnetic energy propagates, the closer an EW emitter is to the receiver it is attempting to jam, the less power it will require relative to the power output of the target. For small UAV-type platforms, therefore, stand-in jamming is likely to be the only viable approach to degrading key hostile systems such as surveillance and air defence radars. This means that not only must a precision effector carry a sophisticated electronic attack payload and sufficient power and cooling to operate it for the duration that the effect is required, but it must also carry this payload some distance inside hostile airspace. The penetration distances required will vary according to which components of the mass precision strike complex the EW effector is required to enable. However, as a rule, such systems will be more complex and more expensive than a kinetic effector with a similar range, propulsion and guidance/navigation configuration. Their effects must also be carefully tailored and tested to avoid interfering with the sensors and communications elements required for the rest of the precision strike complex to function as intended, or with any other joint force elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decoys carry a form of EW payload calibrated to send signals to hostile radars that make them generate false targets, thus making it harder for operators to discern and engage real ones. Just as with electronic attack assets, such payloads tend to be complex and expensive and to rely on a sophisticated national ELINT collection, analysis and mission data production capability to be effective. If such decoys are also intended to mimic larger combat aircraft or cruise missile targets, then they may also require more expensive jet propulsion and specialised airframe designs to enable them to fly at speeds and altitudes that are not easily identifiable as decoy tracks by hostile radar operators. Such decoys already exist as air- and ground-launched effects, and so the application of such techniques to a more novel massed precision effects complex would need to demonstrate a more convincing operational effect for significantly less investment compared with simply purchasing additional systems such as the US-made Miniature Air-Launched Decoy family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-fielding-the-mass-uav-precision-complex&quot;&gt;III. Fielding the Mass UAV Precision Complex&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having outlined the parameters of the technologies that make up a mass precision strike complex, and the platforms involved, it becomes possible to outline the units of action, enablers and structures required to deliver these platforms at a tactically relevant scale. This chapter covers, therefore, the enabling capabilities necessary to operate a mass precision complex and the requisite units of action to field the systems. The chapter thereafter addresses some of the implications of technological trends for how the complex may function collaboratively. The last section covers the question of swarming, which is endlessly theorised but rarely detailed in terms of practical scale and purpose on the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;dependencies&quot;&gt;Dependencies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most fundamentally important capabilities for enabling the sustainable and effective employment of any mass precision strike complex is close-to-real-time monitoring of the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) across the area of operations. Neither side can deny access to all parts of the EMS at all times, even if it possesses large quantities of advanced EW equipment. This is because denial of the EMS also affects friendly units, and because the emissions that enable wide-area and wide-spectrum jamming are easily identified and targeted. Therefore, even an adversary with EW superiority will have to leave parts of the spectrum open for use at certain times in certain places. The same applies to friendly EW effects being employed at the strategic, operational and tactical levels – effects being employed must be understood and deconflicted with massed precision complex operations to avoid electronic fratricide. Most small UAV losses on both sides in Ukraine are caused by EW rather than kinetic defences and, for both sides, fratricide accounts for a significant proportion of those losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, for effective mission planning and real-time command and control of a mass precision strike complex, the ability to map, interpret and respond to hostile and friendly EW effects and EMS usage in the round is a prerequisite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The degree of access to or denial of each band of the spectrum will vary geographically, as well as over time, due to the impact of EW asset location, geography and the altitude bands within which assets are operating. This means a requirement for granular information on the real-time use of the EMS over such a wide area that the only likely source of such data is orbital collection. Hence, a core dependency for fielding a mass precision strike complex is access to high-fidelity orbital EMS monitoring assets, suitable downlink and ground stations, and a processing and dissemination architecture to interpret the data gathered and rapidly push it out to units of action on or near the frontlines. However cheap the UAVs making up a mass precision strike complex might be, this EMS monitoring, analysis, dissemination and mission planning capability is unavoidably very expensive, and is something only states can currently achieve. Much less reliable EMS mapping can be achieved from ground systems, but it will not offer a comparable breadth of high-fidelity returns. One approach to building an EMS survey for deep strike missions in the absence of space-based collection is to use a scouting UAV to conduct dynamic, real-time safe route planning for follow-on salvos, a tactic already employed by Russia with Shahed-136 variants that push EMS and telemetry data to the weapon’s launch station. At the same time, such planning also relies on detailed and up-to-date terrain and feature mapping to allow flight paths to take into account terrain masking, obstacle avoidance and defences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survivability and effectiveness of all elements of a mass precision strike complex hinge on the effectiveness or otherwise of mission planning. The aim is to maximise mission effectiveness within the capability bounds of the various component assets while minimising loss rates likely to be suffered through risk mitigation. The level of dependency on detailed mission planning increases the further the penetration distances required into contested airspace. Routes must be more detailed, exposure to defence systems is more likely and sustained, and communications challenges are more likely to be encountered between operators and assets as penetration distances increase. Furthermore, the requirement to fly further means larger, more expensive platforms whose loss is more consequential than for small, short-range UAVs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important planning input is up-to-date data on the location and activity of air defence assets within potential range of the route to be flown. Some will give away their location by actively scanning with long-range radars, but others will spend most of their time in a passive state or emitting at a power level or in a frequency band that makes long-range ELINT triangulation challenging. Thus, accurate intelligence on the laydown of hostile air defence assets requires fusing data from multiple orbital, stand-off and stand-in assets across all domains. All this information will feed into mission planning for navigation modes, flight routing and altitude profile, reversionary courses of action, and assumptions on connectivity to assets in flight for real-time control, re-tasking and data offboarding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI and other less advanced automated processing tools have already made such planning far quicker and easier than it was in the past, and such advances will no doubt continue. Therefore, mission planning teams are likely over time to become significantly smaller and to require less specialised training to be capable. However, the core input data required cannot be generated by AI, so the dependency of mission planning tools on inputs such as up-to-date geospatial and EMS data will remain, regardless of how advanced the tools themselves become. This requirement also means that UAV operators need access to feeds derived from Above Secret capabilities, and so must be appropriately cleared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most striking lessons from the large-scale use of UAVs during the war in Ukraine has been the speed at which software, and sometimes hardware, must be iteratively adapted to retain operational utility. As of mid-2023, the average period of peak effectiveness for a newly deployed UAV navigation and/or control system on the battlefield was around two weeks, with degrading effectiveness over four more weeks. Between six and 12 weeks, the adversary would have gathered sufficient data on the waveforms and techniques being used to start effectively jamming and/or spoofing the system across the front. If a new UAV control technique is used near to a specialised counter-UAV EW asset such as the Russian Shipovnik-Aero, then the process of enemy adaptation is significantly faster – typically around two weeks. The development of AI-enabled signals analysis and EW signal development means that these timeframes for hostile adaptation against newly deployed UAV control and navigation techniques are likely to converge towards the shorter timeframe, with the primarily limitation being assurance of countermeasures and the distribution of mission data files across defensive systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, a mass precision strike complex will require organic software development teams. They will need to be empowered to rapidly iterate the software and signal types used for control and navigation in order to allow the systems that the units operate to remain effective in the face of rapid and continuous adversary adaptation. It also requires the military to have the intellectual property rights to interfere with and adjust the functioning of the system. Vendors must expose more controls to their systems in order to allow lower-level adjustments through intuitive interfaces, scripting abilities and clear, comprehensive documentation. There is also a fundamental requirement for modular platforms, where adjustments can be made to airframes or sensors can be swapped out in the field by design, rather than the currently fairly monolithic design seen in most systems. In many respects, the body of a UAV is the least important part of it, with the interfaces for wings and mission systems being critical. This rapid iteration of software and control signal frequency patterns will also need to be deconflicted with concurrent friendly-force EW efforts. Just as adversary EW techniques will be constantly adapting, friendly ones will need to do the same to remain effective against adversary UAVs, sensors and communications channels. The interplay between the constant development of EW and counter-EW software is likely to be one of the defining tests for forces seeking to effectively employ mass precision strike complexes, with the side that can better integrate and deconflict these efforts having a huge advantage. Systems which cannot be upgraded post-delivery to new radio and EW-related modules will quickly become obsolete. Equally, national regulatory and certification approaches that do not adapt to enable the required rapid pace of constant experimentation and adaptation will prevent those states from remaining competitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scaling-effect&quot;&gt;Scaling Effect&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fielding a UAV is simple in technical – if not always in regulatory or acquisition – terms. In contrast, coordinating large numbers of UAVs so that strike systems arrive while an ISR UAV remains over the target, in an EW-contested environment where different systems have variable setup times and fly at different speeds, is a complex process. Having appropriate command and control links so that UAV operators can set up and plan missions for their UAVs drawing on the intelligence feeds outlined in the previous section means that employing these systems effectively is anything but simple. This section aims to outline hypothetical units of action to deliver scale of effect for the systems described in the previous chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For tactical ISR, these systems are organic capabilities within combat formations, with a density of around two UAVs per platoon. They will be attrited at a constant rate and must be resupplied. The main requirement is that the detections from these systems are not held at the platoon but are classified and passed up-echelon to the battalion or brigade command post. This could be through operators indicating what they observe; it can also be achieved by patching the feeds back via satellite uplink or other rebroadcasting systems. For mounted platoons, the ability to have the feed interrogated by a processor in order to generate detections means that what is offboarded could comprise a list of objects and locations – still images or even simple text – rather than full-motion video, reducing bandwidth requirements and helping with emissions control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond tactical ISR, the mission support necessary to maintain the efficiency of, and access to, trained operators, planning tools and maintenance favours grouping multiple UAV types into formations allocated to support parts of the front. This is consistent with lessons from Ukraine, where the efficiency of UAV operations when conducted by a dedicated formation has risen from 10% up to 70% for some mission sets. This is especially necessary if capabilities such as tactical strike are to scale. Although individual strikes may be called in because of detections from tactical formations, the scaling of effect requires a large salvo of strike platforms to converge simultaneously. Given the number of munitions identified in the previous chapter as optimal for immobilising a company group, we may hypothesise that a unit of action must be able to generate 24 strike UAVs simultaneously. Assuming approximate dimensions of 2 m in length and 40 cm width with folding wings, a pack of six such UAVs should be mountable on a tactical utility vehicle. A grouping of four such vehicles, each with three crew – a driver, a communicator and an operator – would make up a platoon. Operating in two pairs, this would allow peer recovery between the launch platforms, and for offset communications antennae to be established in two separate locations, helping to make the command link to the strike wave more resilient. This would also enable strike systems to converge on a target from different vectors without staggering launches. Given the need for repeat salvos, groupings of three such platoons comprising the tactical strike company of a UAV battalion would create units of action that could be assigned in support of frontages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deep ISR requires a different tempo of launch and recovery. Although one UAV would be used to cover a given direction, the need to maintain an orbit generates a requirement for three UAVs to constitute a unit of action, with one being recovered, one being prepared for launch or transiting to station, and one in flight at any given time. Given a two-part disassembling wing construction and detachable tail, two airframes should fit in a tactical utility vehicle. Three platforms, therefore, should fit in two vehicles, with the spare space in the second vehicle taken up with ideally two antennae and the command and control equipment for the UAVs. A crew of three per vehicle could comprise a driver/mechanic, a communicator and sensor operator, and a pilot. This would allow one mechanic to prepare a UAV for launch and one to recover a UAV, while one operator and pilot pair rested or maintained communications with other force elements, and the other pilot and sensor operator focused on programming and flying a mission. Six such vehicle pairs could, therefore, generate six orbits in depth at surge, or three sustained orbits across the battlespace, comprising a deep reconnaissance company in a mass precision strike battalion, collectively surveying approximately 60 km of front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of effectors for a given deep strike will vary considerably based on the target set. However, the minimum size of the strike platforms and their requirements allows units of action to be described. Assuming an effector weighing between 140 kg and 200 kg with a warhead between 20 kg and 50 kg, it is reasonable to launch between eight and 12 effectors from a containerised set of canisters on a standard military truck. There is a trade-off, with folding wings allowing for more to be carried while adding some cost and complexity to the munition. In any case, a spring-based catapult in the canister allows accelerated launch. Assuming three such vehicles comprising a launch battery, with a fourth vehicle carrying tools, spare parts and communications equipment, a standard unit of action should be able to launch up to 36 munitions, with three separate launch positions. Premising the launch unit on standard military trucks helps to disguise the launchers. The cab would then require the ability to programme the route for the munitions. Each truck would be assumed to have three crew, comprising a driver, an engineer and a communications specialist. It would be assumed that the battalion would field three platoons of such launchers, forming a deep strike company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final two companies in a mass precision strike battalion have several important functions. First, there is a logistics company, responsible for resupplying the different elements. Along with a platoon supporting each UAV company, the logistics company would also need a platoon responsible for fabricating and fitting parts and repairing and modifying UAVs. The second company would comprise the intelligence and headquarters company. This company would require a headquarters element and an intelligence platoon responsible for liaising with wider headquarters to plan mission sets and strikes, and for plotting flight paths. It would also need a software development platoon responsible for harvesting and analysing mission data from across the formation, patching systems, updating mission data files, and designing novel algorithms to enable concepts of employment. Finally, there would be the novel effects platoon, responsible for designing enabling effects and integrating them into payloads. This platoon would also be responsible for employing bespoke UAVs delivering enabling effects. Thus, the full battalion constitutes five companies: a deep ISR company, a close strike company, a deep strike company, an intelligence and headquarters company, and a support company. The reason to group these capabilities is that although different elements may be assigned to various lines of effort, the need to train and certify, and the requirement for supporting enablers to persistently use UAVs, make the administrative concentration of the capabilities sensible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;swarming-and-the-impact-of-autonomy&quot;&gt;Swarming and the Impact of Autonomy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are multiple working definitions of swarming as a capability, but for the purposes of this study, the term will be used to refer to UAVs that are networked together to allow the exchange of data and coordination of behaviour in flight between four or more assets simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swarming capabilities are commonly touted as the most significant area of capability development in the small UAV defence sector. However, the requirement to swarm introduces significant hardware and software complexity, which in turn drives cost growth and reduces the number of individual assets that can be fielded for any given budget. Massed UAV groupings, as seen regularly in light shows at civilian displays, rely on a ground control station tracking the position of all UAVs in a formation at all times and a central mission computer sending commands to each one to coordinate their movements. This allows large numbers of very simple small UAVs to fly in a coordinated fashion, but it is not a practical approach for military UAVs and weapons in a contested battlespace, due to terrain masking, EW, signal range and emissions control challenges – the ground control station would be struck, decapitating the whole swarm. Instead, for a mass precision strike complex to be capable of swarming tactics, the individual assets involved must have onboard sensors and low-latency datalinks that are resistant to hostile EW disruption. In addition, each asset must carry a mission computer powerful enough, and software complex enough, to fuse the information about terrain, threats and targets received from its own sensors and those of other UAVs in the formation through datalinks, and to react to that information dynamically in real time. These capabilities are not inherently new, nor are they reliant on advances in AI or complex machine learning models. However, what the requirements for sensors, datalinks and advanced software do is raise component costs, even if used with an inherently cheap airframe/engine combination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, if a mass precision strike system is premised on swarming tactics for its effectiveness against its core target sets, then the number of assets required to use it in a sustained fashion will be increased, due to the need to consistently project sufficient assets into the target area to swarm. In conjunction with the increased hardware and software complexity required, this requirement to sustainably field swarming UAVs in large quantities over time means that fielding this sort of system as more than a “Night One” theatre entry tool is likely to be uneconomical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of where swarming capabilities are likely to add value commensurate with the additional cost implied by their inclusion as part of a precision strike complex, the primary application will be to improve the capability to overwhelm air defence systems. The most effective way to overwhelm air defence systems is to present them with multiple simultaneous threats from different directions. This is especially effective against SHORAD systems that use automatic cannons, or directionally mounted missile racks rather than vertical-launch missile racks. Directional systems such as Gepard or Pantsir must traverse their turret in the direction of each incoming threat to engage them sequentially, which takes time, even if the air defence system’s radar or other sensors can track 360°. However, it is also important to note that mission planning can achieve this sort of effect against defences protecting fixed sites without needing assets capable of swarming behaviour. Russian attacks with Shahed-136s frequently present Ukrainian defences with this challenge by simply sequencing launches and route planning so that multiple UAVs arrive at the target area from different directions near-simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other advantages of swarming capabilities are that they can help reduce wasted warheads by deconflicting target selection so that multiple assets do not hit the same target. However, doing so in a way that can differentiate between a target having been hit and successfully disabled versus a target having been hit ineffectively and thus requiring a repeat strike with another asset requires significantly more advanced sensor and processing capabilities than simple deconfliction. Ultimately, for target deconfliction and strike optimisation, the value added question will come down to whether the additional efficiency against defended and undefended target sets gained from functional swarming capabilities outweighs the strike weight foregone by the increase in individual asset cost and the resultant reduction in quantity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some collaborative behaviours that fall short of swarming, but which may be worthwhile. A long-range mass strike using UAVs is most effective when defensive systems have minimal time to respond, and it is therefore advantageous for the UAVs to fly low; however, if there is any requirement for communications, then low-altitude flight makes it much harder to maintain a command link. This can be resolved if one UAV flies at a high altitude and acts as a relay for those below. If the relay bird is shot down, a different UAV can rise to take station. In a context without a command link, higher-altitude flight may also allow one UAV to use navigational techniques that are not possible during lower-altitude flight, such as astral navigation. In this way, periodic lifts by one UAV may allow it to reconfirm its position and then calibrate the position of other UAVs such that inertial navigation remains accurate. So long as UAVs have software-defined radios, this kind of behaviour is relatively straightforward. It is the same functionality that is built into Russian anti-ship cruise missiles, which have one loft to search for targets while the majority retain a sea-skimming profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has laid out the primary dependencies and variables involved in designing and fielding a mass precision strike complex using UAVs as a core part of a modern Western land force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary conclusion is that there are significantly more aggressive trade-offs and costs involved in creating a massed UAV precision strike capability that can form a core part of a land force, as opposed to one that can function as a niche tool set for specific use cases. The land forces of a medium power such as the UK must be able to reliably conduct operations in a wide range of operational environments and conditions. It is no good, therefore, relying on massed precision strike effects for core capabilities if the systems that deliver those effects do not function reliably in bad weather, extreme temperatures, at night or in an EMS-contested environment. As outlined in Chapter I, it is possible to fit UAVs with sensors and navigation, mission system and airframe features that allow them to operate in such conditions. However, if those requirements are seen as essential, then said sensors, navigation suites and mission systems will themselves add significant cost to each asset, even if the airframes can be produced cheaply en masse by additive manufacturing or reliance on the civil sector. Furthermore, once expensive sensors, payloads and hardware are added, the economic case for investing in propulsion and airframe features that will enhance survivability (but further increase costs) is strengthened, since the loss of each cheap airframe will be accompanied by the loss of expensive components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, developing and exploiting the capabilities potentially offered by mass precision strike complexes is not simply a matter of achieving a viable cost-per-effect in specific scenarios. No investment in military forces in the modern world comes without opportunity costs, since budget and personnel resources allocated to realising the capability must be diverted from other things. In other words, the use case for mass precision strike complexes must not only be predicated on finding mission areas where they can be sustainably procured and used at scale within available funding. They must also represent a better return on investment than other weapons systems and effectors to which resources and personnel are already/could alternatively be dedicated. This must also hold true in all likely operational scenarios that the joint force might be called upon to fight in, if such capabilities are to be fielded at scale as a core force element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advances in AI and software development are radically reducing the cost of achieving various levels of capability in terms of mission planning, mission systems and sensor exploitation. However, these advances come with their own – sometimes onerous – hardware and onboard power requirements, and they do not change core trade-offs in other areas. For instance, battery and fuel energy storage density is not increasing at a rapid enough rate over time to radically alter the core relationship between a platform’s size and its potential range, endurance, transit speed and payload capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One enduring debate regarding UAVs is the extent to which they should be operated by a specialist community, as opposed to being distributed widely. The conclusion of this study is that UAVs may be distributed to provide units with situational awareness, but mass precision strike should be managed by a specialist formation. This is not only because of the significant improvement in effectiveness achievable with skilled mission planning. Experience from contemporary theatres shows that almost all UAV capabilities are highly susceptible to hard counters as the adversary learns how the UAV functions; capabilities must therefore be continuously adapted and their supporting mission data files updated. This requires scarce skills such as UAV design and programming and the accumulation of data centrally. It therefore makes sense to concentrate UAV operation if UAVs are parts of a mass precision strike complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this paper has argued that there are limitations on mass precision strike efficiency when compared with legacy strike systems, it has demonstrated that against targets that lack proper defences, UAVs offer a means to achieve extremely disproportionate attrition. If they are cheap, UAVs can also impose substantial inefficiency on enemy logistics and enablement. It follows that forces are likely to endeavour to field counter-UAV capabilities, which, like mass precision strike capabilities, impose an opportunity cost on the force. Since the UAVs making up a mass precision strike complex are also available to potential state adversaries and non-state armed groups, Western militaries will need to develop and field counter-UAV and integrated air defence capabilities at scale. This paper has not addressed how counter-UAV capabilities are to be fielded. The development of counter-UAV capability will be the subject of the second study in this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final observation that arises from this paper is that most NATO states lack the regulatory structures to be able to field and maintain a competitive mass UAV precision strike complex. This paper has demonstrated what features and capabilities can be used to make UAVs survivable and able to achieve their mission, but almost all techniques are contestable. In this context, preserving the effects deliverable at scale through UAVs over the course of the fight requires constant updates, the adjustment of tactics, techniques and procedures, airframe and payload optimisation and software changes. In Ukraine, this process can, at its most intense, take place in 48-hour cycles. Since most NATO members treat UAVs as aircraft and therefore require their re-certification whenever they are modified if they are to be flown for testing, it follows that NATO’s regulatory structures render it almost impossible to adapt the necessary capabilities at the speed of relevance. This paper, by setting out the processes required to field those capabilities, hopefully provides a realistic outline of what must be permissible if NATO forces are to retain military advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
