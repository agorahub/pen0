At the same time, it could create new pathways for malicious actors to synthesize harmful pathogens and other biomolecules.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-americas-ai-action-plan-trump-administration-2025&quot;&gt;— America’s AI Action Plan, Trump Administration, 2025&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To protect against adversaries’ misuse of biotechnology, the United States must be able to detect and characterize the widest possible array of biological threats and do so early.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-falling-barriers-to-bioterrorism-are-set-to-accelerate-in-the-emerging-age-of-ai-and-biotechnology&quot;&gt;The falling barriers to bioterrorism are set to accelerate in the emerging age of AI and biotechnology.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and biotechnology presents incredible opportunities to accelerate scientific discovery and improve global health—opportunities that the United States must seize. At the same time, the dual-use nature of AI-enabled biotechnology poses new security challenges for policymakers worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost and technical expertise required to develop bioweapons have been sharply declining for nearly a century. Now, rapid advancements in AI capabilities present two emerging biosecurity threats in which AI could assist actors in developing bioweapons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Popular large language models (LLMs) could soon drastically lower the informational barriers for planning and executing biological attacks.&lt;/strong&gt; Recent assessments of LLMs and other commercial AI capabilities indicate that models are “on the cusp” of meaningfully helping novices develop and acquire bioweapons by providing critical information and step-by-step guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future AI biological design tools (BDTs) could assist actors in developing more harmful or even novel epidemic- or pandemic-scale pathogens.&lt;/strong&gt; Rapid advancements in state-of-the-art BDTs—illustrated by the foundation model Evo 2—point to a world in which more capable models could help develop new or enhanced pathogens and evade existing safeguards.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;current-us-biosecurity-measures-are-ill-equipped-to-prevent-ai-enabled-biological-threats&quot;&gt;Current U.S. biosecurity measures are ill-equipped to prevent AI-enabled biological threats.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because no single intervention is sufficient to address the complexity, diversity, and evolving nature of biological threats, successfully mitigating biological risks from AI will require multiple layers of defense spread across multiple steps of the bioweaponization pathway. Implementing AI-model safeguards and strengthening oversight of nucleic acid synthesis represent two critical choke points in AI-enabled bioweapons development and thus opportunities for targeted policymaking. However, these measures face tough challenges ahead:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critical safeguards in advanced BDTs can already be circumvented by users post-deployment.&lt;/strong&gt; The first Evo model shows that users are already able to bypass key BDT security measures by adding harmful viral data originally removed from the model’s training dataset back into it later via fine-tuning. Concerningly, the Evo series represents one of only a handful of BDTs that possess any such safeguards at all.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;List-based approaches to screening nucleic acid synthesis will likely fail to detect future AI-generated sequences that do not match known agents and toxins.&lt;/strong&gt; To date, there are only 63 regulated toxins, pathogens, and bacteria on the Select Agents and Toxins List compiled by the Department of Health and Human Services and Department of Agriculture. When including export-controlled items on the Bureau of Industry and Security’s Commerce Control List (CCL) for international orders, there are only approximately 150 unique items. Special safeguards apply when a customer requests synthesis of any of these regulated agents and toxins.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In theory, synthesis providers’ screening mechanisms work until a BDT creates the 64th (or, for international orders, the 151st) highly contagious and lethal organism that is not yet on one of these lists. There are thus serious risks that these lists of regulated sequences are an increasingly inadequate line of defense to catch new AI-generated ones. Static lists are insufficient for a world in which novel organisms are relatively easy to design. Though such capabilities are considerably beyond what the most advanced AI systems are capable of today, they may be closer than they seem given the demonstrated pace of technological acceleration. Ongoing efforts to expand screening protocols to capture additional sequences of concern are nascent and could quickly fall behind due to slow and uneven data collection methods.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-united-states-must-strengthen-biosecurity-in-the-ai-era&quot;&gt;The United States must strengthen biosecurity in the AI era.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Trump administration’s July 2025 AI Action Plan rightly identifies, investing in biosecurity is an essential component to the United States’ national security strategy. To pursue a high-return, low-cost biodefense policy, U.S. policymakers and lawmakers should undertake the following recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fund the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the U.S. Center for AI Standards and Innovation (CAISI) to continue their critical work at the intersection of AI and biosecurity.&lt;/strong&gt; NIST and CAISI are conducting unique and urgently needed work to prevent the misuse of AI and biotechnology for bioterrorism. While both organizations are central to the success of the Trump AI Action Plan, the administration’s proposed cuts to their budgets threaten these critical centers of government expertise, capacity, and industry engagement. U.S. policymakers and lawmakers should support NIST and CAISI with funding proportionate to scope of their responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluate frontier BDT capabilities with testing led by CAISI and with support from the interagency Testing Risks for AI and National Security (TRAINS) Taskforce and the international network of AI Safety Institutes.&lt;/strong&gt; A comprehensive U.S. biosecurity strategy should include evaluating the unique capabilities and associated risks posed by BDTs, including non-commercial BDTs, as they evolve. CAISI should conduct BDT model evaluations to assess frontier BDTs for emerging high-impact biological capabilities, leveraging existing resources including the TRAINS Taskforce and international AI Safety Institute network to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop a standardized, AI-enabled, nucleic acid synthesis-screening system.&lt;/strong&gt; Current list-based synthesis-screening measures are uneven across industry and will likely fail to detect AI-generated agents over time. The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and relevant U.S. agencies should develop a plan to integrate AI capabilities into standardized screening measures that can detect new and augmented AI-generated sequences beyond lists of federally regulated agents and toxins. This system could implement a tiered risk assessment of sequence orders based on sequence function and strengthen collective biosecurity while reducing compliance burdens for industry.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hollywood has depicted mad scientists causing global catastrophes with devious technologies for so long, the idea has its own Wikipedia entry. Unfortunately, in the emerging age of AI-enabled biotechnology, evil geniuses using technology for mass destruction could soon move from fiction to fact. Worse, such capabilities could also fall within reach of “evil morons” aided by genius-level AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, one of the greatest gifts to U.S. national security has been that building weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) is expensive and complicated. There are, of course, plenty of simple, cost-effective ways to wreak havoc on localized groups of people. But thankfully, the enormous expertise and budget needed to develop and deploy WMDs such as nuclear bombs is prohibitively high for the average terrorist. Even well-resourced nation-states like Saddam Hussein’s Iraq, which spent around $10 billion on its nuclear weapons program, failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is in the United States’ interest that WMDs continue to require lots of money and highly trained scientists. Unfortunately, the barriers to developing some WMDs, especially biological weapons, have fallen sharply over the last century. As Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) professor Kevin Esvelt told Congress in 2022, “We live in the biological version of a world in which weapons-grade plutonium can be mail-ordered and thousands of engineers have the skills to assemble a nuclear device, but no one knows exactly which design would work.” However, with rapid advancements in large language models and biological design tools, this final barrier may be increasingly shrinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. policymakers face the challenge of strengthening biosecurity measures for an AI era while ensuring that biotechnology innovation can still flourish. AI-enabled biotechnology stands to improve billions of lives globally by accelerating vaccine discovery, improving healthcare diagnostics, and enhancing countless other fields. At the same time, the trajectory of AI’s biological capabilities points to a world in which evading existing safeguards could become increasingly straightforward. As AI continues to revolutionize the biotechnology field, policymakers have the tough job of promoting its incredible benefits for science and society while preventing bad actors from exploiting these tools to engineer epidemic- or pandemic-capable agents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration has recently expressed commitment to investing in U.S. biosecurity in its July 2025 AI Action Plan, a comprehensive policy playbook outlining the administration’s priorities for AI. The plan rightly identifies AI’s dual-use capabilities in the biological domain and the need to mature the United States’ biosecurity strategy to counter emerging threats from bad actors. Its recommendations for strengthening nucleic acid synthesis screening and developing government AI evaluation capabilities, while largely high-level at this stage, are nevertheless a promising start for updating the United States’ biodefense for an AI era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper surveys emerging AI-enabled bioterrorism risks and offers further recommendations for enhancing synthesis screening and advancing government AI evaluation capabilities for biothreats. It examines two AI-enabled bioterrorism risks: (1) falling informational barriers to bioterrorism from LLMs and (2) harmful biological design risks from BDTs. It then turns to two biosecurity measures: (1) BDT security controls and (2) list-based nucleic acid synthesis screening. While these measures are essential components of a multilayered U.S. biodefense system, the report outlines how rapid technological advancements are exposing critical gaps for meeting AI-enabled biorisks. The report concludes with three recommendations for U.S. policymakers and lawmakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-falling-barriers-to-bioweapons-development&quot;&gt;The Falling Barriers to Bioweapons Development&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost and technical expertise required to develop bioweapons have been sharply declining for nearly a century. During World War II, the U.S. bioweapons program (later terminated in 1969 during the Nixon administration) employed around 4,500 people, of whom a significant share were technical experts. Its multiyear budget totaled $60 million—close to 3 percent of total spending on the Manhattan Project, which was itself at its peak almost 0.5 percent of U.S. GDP. Similarly, Japan’s World War II biological warfare program employed roughly 3,000 people, including hundreds of Japan’s top medical experts (and more than a few psychopaths).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decades later, in the 1990s, the Japanese terrorist organization Aum Shinrikyo made multiple attempts to develop and deploy biological weapons using botulinum and anthrax. Thankfully, Aum Shinrikyo’s efforts failed. However, the group successfully executed many of the steps for developing and delivering bioweapons despite having fewer than two dozen technical members and a budget substantially smaller than a nation-state (though still in the millions of dollars). Aum Shinrikyo still needed smart people with advanced degrees, but far fewer than the United States or Japan required during World War II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, in 2017, two Canadian scientists successfully recreated the previously extinct horsepox virus for just $100,000. Rather than developing the virus themselves, the scientists outsourced much of the initial work—custom ordering fragments of the DNA from a commercial synthesis lab, which “printed” and shipped the viral DNA back to them via mail. The scientists then linked the fragments together in a lab and introduced them into cells using a helper virus, producing the final horsepox virus. Though the study exclusively aimed to improve vaccine and cancer treatments (rather than produce bioweapons), it nevertheless attracted widespreadalarm at the time by indicating that reviving smallpox—a close cousin to horsepox and one of the deadliest diseases known to mankind—would, as Science reported, “probably take a small scientific team with little specialized knowledge half a year.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;preventing-ai-enabled-bioweapons-as-a-matter-of-urgency&quot;&gt;Preventing AI-Enabled Bioweapons as a Matter of Urgency&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, AI threatens to reduce the number of experts needed to develop bioweapons further still. On March 5, 2025, a paper released by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, former Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang, and Center for AI Safety Executive Director Dan Hendrycks argued that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;AI could provide step-by-step guidance on designing lethal pathogens, sourcing materials, and optimizing methods of dispersal. What once required specialized knowledge and resources could become accessible to individuals with malevolent intent, dramatically increasing the potential for catastrophic outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dario Amodei, CEO of the AI lab Anthropic, agrees and predicted in 2023 that such capabilities could be possible in as few as two to three years. Anthropic reissued a similar timeline earlier this year, and reported testing showing that one of its recent models, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, already “demonstrates concerning improvements in its capacity to support aspects of biological weapons development.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some, including U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance, have said that the United States should greet Big Tech’s calls for AI regulation with skepticism, arguing that onerous government regulations squash startups while strengthening incumbent tech giants that can bear compliance costs. However, in the case of AI-enabled bioweapons, calls for greater security are grounded in good sense. Even traditionally staunch opponents of AI regulations such as Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg have acknowledged that the AI-related risk from bioweapons deserves special attention and mitigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first Trump administration, to its credit, also recognized that growing biosecurity risks were real and demanded action in its 2018 National Biodefense Strategy, which rightly stated, “Biological threats—whether naturally occurring, accidental, or deliberate in origin—are among the most serious threats facing the United States. . . . As we reap the benefits from biotechnologies, we must also understand and consider the risks they may pose.” The strategy further pledged to “promote appropriate measures to impede misuse of life sciences and biotechnology” as part of the administration’s strategic vision in which “the United States actively and effectively prevents . . . risk from natural, accidental, or deliberate biological threats.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second Trump administration has recently reaffirmed this commitment in its highly anticipated AI Action Plan. The administration calls for the federal government to develop “new tools and infrastructure” for a “multi-tiered approach” to nucleic acid synthesis screening, including more stringent screening requirements and a data sharing mechanism for industry (discussed in later sections of this paper). It also encourages relevant agencies, including CAISI, to evaluate models for biological and other national security-related risks (see recommendation two of this paper).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;emerging-biosecurity-risks-from-ai&quot;&gt;Emerging Biosecurity Risks from AI&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration is right to identify biosecurity as a national security imperative in the AI era. However, the time to prepare for AI-enabled biological threats is quickly running out. Rapid advancements in AI capabilities present two scenarios in which AI could meaningfully assist actors with developing bioweapons. First, AI labs warn that popular commercial LLMs could soon drastically lower informational barriers to planning and executing biological attacks. Second, future BDTs could assist actors in producing more harmful or novel agents and toxins of epidemic or pandemic scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;large-language-models-reducing-informational-barriers-to-bioterrorism&quot;&gt;Large Language Models: Reducing Informational Barriers to Bioterrorism&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2025, AI lab OpenAI published a safety assessment of Deep Research, one of its advanced AI capabilities, in which it stated, “Our evaluations found that deep research can help experts with the operational planning of reproducing a known biological threat . . . [and] indicate our models are on the cusp of being able to meaningfully help novices create known biological threats.” The company underlined this conclusion in an April 2025 safety assessment of its o3 and o4-mini models, adding:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We expect current trends of rapidly increasing [biological] capability to continue, and for models to cross this [high-risk] threshold in the near future. In preparation, we are intensifying our investments in safeguards. . . . At the same time, we also encourage broader efforts to prepare for a world where the informational barriers to creating such threats are drastically lower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less than a week after OpenAI published this assessment, a study—conducted by researchers from SecureBio, MIT, the Center for AI Safety, and Federal University of ABC in Brazil—revealed o3 outperformed 94 percent of expert virologists on a subject matter test, which measured the ability to troubleshoot complex virology lab protocols. The results demonstrate that widely available LLMs such as o3 can provide expert-level advice on dual-use virology topics, prompting what the study called an “urgent need for thoughtful access controls” on these models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenAI has recently implemented stricter biological safeguards in its new ChatGPT agent, a model capable of semi-autonomous, multi-step research and task execution. In a July 2025 assessment of the model, the lab stated that it would treat the agent as “highly capable” in the biological portion of its Preparedness Framework, a classification reserved for capabilities that significantly increase existing risks for severe harm. Though OpenAI clarified that the move was precautionary, it nevertheless reiterated that increasingly available AI bio capabilities could soon meaningfully help actors develop biological threats with fewer barriers to entry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenAI is not the only lab reporting rapid advancements in its models’ abilities to provide users with information critical to bioweapons development. Anthropic’s assessment of Claude 3.7 Sonnet similarly revealed that the model “provides better advice in key steps of the weaponization pathway, makes fewer mistakes in critical steps . . . and ultimately make[s] solving complex problems [in WMD creation] faster” than previous models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of special note, in a trial that tested whether the model could meaningfully assist users in bioweapons planning and acquisition, one Anthropic employee achieved a score of 91 percent using Claude 3.7 Sonnet. The trial set 80 percent as the threshold in which a model is deemed to substantially increase the risk of catastrophic misuse (though Anthropic reported that the average test scores from all participants fell below this threshold). Anthropic reported that external red teaming of its more recent model, Claude Opus 4, demonstrates “more accurate and comprehensive answers in some areas of bioweapons-related topics” compared to Claude 3.7, leading the lab to activate the next level of its security control framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Safety evaluations of the R1 model developed by Chinese AI lab DeepSeek also demonstrate significant bio risks. Testing revealed that R1 can be tricked into producing content about harmful topics—a process known as “jailbreaking”—more easily than its Western AI counterparts due to fewer guardrails embedded within the model. In a February 2025 interview, Anthropic’s Dario Amodei said his company’s evaluation of DeepSeek found it generated information critical to producing bioweapons that “can’t be found on Google or can’t be easily found in textbooks,” adding that “the DeepSeek model did the worst of basically any model we’d ever tested in that it had absolutely no blocks whatsoever against generating this information.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such assessments from leading AI labs demonstrate that LLMs are rapidly approaching or even exceeding critical security thresholds for providing users key bioweapons development information—with some models already demonstrating capabilities that surpass expert-level knowledge. While some of the leading companies are voluntarily imposing safeguards, the overall trajectory nevertheless points toward a near-term future in which policymakers must confront bioterrorism risks not just from sophisticated state and terrorist organizations, but potentially from individuals with little technical background but access to popular LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;biological-design-tools-generating-pathogenic-and-toxic-sequences&quot;&gt;Biological Design Tools: Generating Pathogenic and Toxic Sequences&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On February 19, 2025, researchers from the nonprofit Arc Institute, Stanford University, and AI chip designer Nvidia announced the world’s largest biological AI foundation model, known as Evo 2. The model (also known as a biological design tool, or BDT) is trained on a dataset containing over 128,000 genomes from an astonishingly diverse set of lifeforms, including humans, animals, plants, bacteria, and other organisms, in addition to certain viruses. This enormous database reportedly allows it to identify novel patterns between different DNA sequences and to design the genomes of entirely new organisms. Using this BDT, researchers can enter the sequences of real and/or hypothetical organisms to simulate how that organism would develop in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evo 2 is already demonstrating impressive results in the biomedical field. The tool reportedly achieves 90 percent accuracy in predicting whether various mutations of a breast cancer–related gene will be benign or possibly pathogenic. The implications of this high-fidelity simulation capability are enormous. According to the Arc Institute, “Insights like this could save countless hours and research dollars needed to run cell or animal experiments.” Similarly, Stanford University writes, “Imagine being able to speed up evolution—hypothetically—to learn which genes might have a harmful or beneficial effect on human health. Imagine, further, being able to rapidly generate new genetic sequences that could help cure disease.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evo 2 is just one of many BDTs making valuable contributions to science. Google DeepMind’s AlphaFold model, for instance, won its developers the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for accurately predicting the three-dimensional structure of proteins from their amino acid sequences, greatly outperforming previous methods. Likewise, IBM’s Biomedical Foundation Models are helping accelerate and streamline drug discovery by widening the scope for novel molecules and determining unsuitable molecules earlier in the research process. These tools and many others are already transforming numerous scientific fields and are extremely promising for the future of global health. They should first and foremost be understood in these terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if BDTs such as Evo 2 can generate good outputs, then presumably more capable future tools could create bad ones, too. Imagine, for instance, bird flu: Some strains have a reported human mortality rate of more than 50 percent, meaning that approximately one out of every two people that contract the disease will die. There are other versions of flu that are not as lethal but are more contagious. Someone who contracts the more common seasonal flu, for instance, will spread it to 1–2 other people on average. Malicious actors, however, might use a more advanced BDT with generative capabilities to create a new version of bird flu that is both highly lethal and highly contagious. Such a scenario would likely make the Covid-19 pandemic—which has claimed more than 27 million lives and shaken the world economy—look like the common cold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, BDTs are incapable of designing such pathogens from scratch. In a December 2024 report, experts representing several leading universities, AI companies, and research organizations argued that the reality of AI-enabled biorisk is that these tools cannot currently be used for novel pathogen design due to a lack of viral training data as a principle bottleneck. A March 2025 report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) agreed, arguing that while today’s state-of-the-art BDTs can design much simpler biological structures such as molecules, they are currently unable to design self-replicating pathogens, which are orders of magnitude more complex. As NASEM stated, it is “unlikely that currently available viral sequence data are sufficient to train such a model,” and current BDTs still lack the requisite understanding of how complex biological systems interact to unlock such capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing on publicly available literature, the December 2024 report concluded that there are “no known examples of current AI biological tools being misused to cause real-world harm” and that “the available literature does not support the notion that access to biological information and planning via current, publicly available LLMs can significantly increase biorisk.” However, the authors admitted that “this does not offer conclusions for future models,” and that further research is needed in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But no serious approach to national security can accept an exclusive focus on risks identical to those that have already occurred. As the attacks of September 11, 2001, and Pearl Harbor painfully demonstrated, malicious actors—whether terrorists or nation-states—are innovative, opportunistic, and able to attack in unprecedented ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, as an illustration of just how fast this landscape is moving, the 2024 report cited a January 2024 OpenAI red-teaming exercise and a June 2024 safety assessment of Anthropic’s Claude 3 model as evidence that “current LLMs . . . do not pose an immediate [bio]risk.” At the time, OpenAI and Anthropic reported little to no uplift in users’ ability to plan and execute a biological attack compared to using other information sources such as the internet. However, both AI labs have since updated their risk assessments to flag substantial and immediate biorisks, with OpenAI concluding in April 2025 that it expects its models to demonstrate “high risks”—meaning that they could substantially increase the likelihood and frequency of bioterrorist attacks by providing meaningful assistance to novices—in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Evo model series also demonstrates significant improvements in BDT capabilities over the course of just one year. Compared to its Evo 1 predecessor (released February 2024), Evo 2 contains 30 times more data and can process more than eight times as much genetic information at a time. As a result, the model demonstrates substantially better generative, predictive, and biological design capabilities, representing in many instances state-of-the-art performance (see Appendix A for a comparison of Evo 1 and Evo 2 model specifications and capabilities).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These rapid improvements can be observed across BDTs at scale. Epoch AI, a nonprofit research institute, estimates that the training compute of the top BDTs (a common metric for determining AI model performance) increased by an average of nearly 21 times per year from 2017 to 2021, the equivalent to doubling just under every three months (Figure 1). The size of model training data, another metric for predicting future performance, grew nearly 10 times per year on average from 2017 to 2021 (Figure 2). Though growth in both of these metrics has since slowed to a more modest 2–3 times per year, BDTs are nevertheless demonstrating continued advancement with more impressive capabilities and thus dual-use concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/QC5aCvy.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Training Compute of BDTs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: Size of BDT Training Datasets&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These rapid advancements in BDTs and LLMs suggest that current limitations do not preclude future AI models from unlocking further capabilities, including potentially much more harmful ones than current models possess. U.S. policymakers should not wait to examine the security implications of more capable models only after they have arrived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one biosecurity expert told CSIS, many studies rightly state that BDTs cannot yet design pandemic-scale pathogens or toxins, yet their emphasis on current limitations paints an overly conservative picture of the trajectory of future capabilities. For example, this source argued, while data availability remains a key developmental bottleneck, experts are working to improve datasets that will inevitably solve this issue. Companies are already working to create biological datasets specifically for training more capable BDTs able to design novel organisms. (Additionally, the Trump administration’s AI Action Plan has tasked federal agencies with exploring the creation of a whole-genome sequencing program that could generate enormous biological datasets to be used in training future models.) Given both public and private sector efforts to overcome bottlenecks to more capable models, BDT capabilities are likely to substantially improve in the next three-to-five years, the expert predicted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other scholars—including several members of the team behind Evo 2—agree that dual-use BDT capabilities are likely to accelerate in the near term. In an August 2024 paper, researchers from Johns Hopkins, Stanford, and Fordham Universities argued that while models are currently limited in their generation capabilities, “The rapid progress of AI—and the ever-larger resources being invested in computation and data generation—suggests that capabilities are likely to accelerate,” and that “limitations are not likely to restrain progress indefinitely.” As they wrote, “Biological models may not be able to substantially contribute to creating novel or enhanced pandemic-capable pathogens today,” but “the essential ingredients to create highly concerning advanced biological models . . . may already exist or soon will. Establishment of effective governance systems now is warranted.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ai-enabled-challenges-to-us-biosecurity-measures&quot;&gt;AI-Enabled Challenges to U.S. Biosecurity Measures&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there are several significant hurdles to overcome when developing bioweapons. To start, there are many millions, if not billions, of viruses and bacteria in the world. Choosing the right one to weaponize matters immensely: Select a bacteria that multiplies too slowly, for instance, and the weapon will fail to disperse quickly enough, preventing maximum impact. One that mutates too fast may exhibit different traits than were intended by the time it is deployed. This is just the first of many complex steps in the pathway to develop a bioweapon, a simplified outline of which is illustrated in Figure 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hYil6QI.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 3: Simplified Diagram of the Biological Weaponization Pathway&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because no single intervention is sufficient to address the complexity, diversity, and evolving nature of biological threats, successfully mitigating biological risks from AI demands multiple layers of defense spread across multiple steps of the bioweaponization pathway. Different measures can offer unique choke points to developing bioweapons various stages of production; for example, effective AI-model security controls can prevent models from answering queries about planning and executing a biological attack (steps 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 in Figure 3). Likewise, nucleic acid synthesis screening can flag harmful sequence orders before they are produced (step 2 in Figure 3). These are just two biosecurity measures, but there are many more, such as physical security controls and management procedures, which are beyond the scope of this paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, some biosecurity measures may soon be inadequate for preventing AI-enabled biological threats as AI capabilities continue to improve. Indeed, evidence suggests that in certain instances, this may already be the case. The following section highlights key limitations in BDT security and synthesis-screening measures to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;bdt-safeguards-circumvention-risks-in-the-evo-model-series&quot;&gt;BDT Safeguards: Circumvention Risks in the Evo Model Series&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without appropriate safeguards, AI could help actors select (or create) the right viral sequences for bioweapons. In anticipation of this risk, Evo 2’s developers have aimed to ensure that the model does not contain information about pathogens that are infectious to humans, animals, and plants in its training dataset. This means Evo 2 struggles to predict the genetic sequences of certain harmful viruses, often gets what predictions it does make wrong, and effectively cannot simulate their genetic codes. What Evo 2’s developers did is loosely analogous to teaching a student chemistry from a textbook with the chapters on explosives ripped out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, if a future model like Evo 2 could indeed create the genetic sequences of entirely new organisms, there is no guarantee that such a model could not be modified to develop new pathogenic capabilities over time. Users with sufficient time and creativity could plausibly make novel, harmful organisms outside of the designated list that was removed from the model’s training data. In keeping with the chemistry analogy, this would be like a student growing up to be such an overall expert in chemistry that they can eventually infer the fundamentals of explosives, even though they were not explicitly taught how to make them in school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another risk is that users could add the removed training data back into the model later. The results of the earlier Evo 1 model already indicate such a possibility. A 2024 academic paper on AI and biosecurity, which includes some of the same authors as the Evo 2 technical paper, stated the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Creators of the Evo [1] model sought to guard against misuse by excluding “viral genomes that infect eukaryotic hosts” [including humans, plants, and animals] from the model’s training data. They then published the model weights, as is currently the norm in academia. Within weeks of Evo’s release, other scientists had refined the model’s published weights with data on viruses that infect humans. The data in that case involved a benign virus family, but the case highlights that fine-tuning an open model is often much cheaper than training a new large model, and so oversight policies will need to account for the possibility of postrelease fine tuning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, eukaryotic viruses were also removed from Evo 1’s pretraining dataset, yet users were able to add human viruses back into the model in a matter of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Evo 2 technical paper did little to reassure that this could not happen again. The paper did not explicitly address how the developers sought to improve their security methodologies with Evo 2. All it said is that the authors&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;collaborated with . . . multidisciplinary experts to reduce risks via data exclusion measures, safety and security evaluations, and population bias evaluations. By excluding genomic sequences of viruses that infect eukaryotes from our training data, we aimed to ensure our openly shared model did not disseminate the capability to manipulate and design pathogenic human viruses. Task-specific post-training may circumvent this risk mitigation measure and should be approached with caution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Evo 2 paper thus outlined a very similar biosecurity methodology to what was taken in developing Evo 1 (i.e., removing eukaryotic viruses from the pretraining dataset) and arrived at the same conclusion that these measures could be circumvented. As an open-source, all-access tool, the probability that this will happen again seems relatively high. At least for now, it appears such a weaponization pathway would nevertheless require a nontrivial amount of expertise to pull off. Still, as the Evo 1 experience highlights, experts could add harmful viral sequences back to the model, thus opening the door for less-sophisticated malicious actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerningly, the Evo model series represents two of only a small number of BDTs that possess any safeguards at all. An Epoch AI survey of 370 biological models—based on these tools’ publications describing the developers’ methodologies and processes—found that fewer than 3 percent include safeguards to mitigate risk, such as evaluations, access controls, or filtering and exclusion of training data. While many smaller, application-specific BDTs do not necessarily need the same levels of controls as more powerful models such as Evo 2, 3 percent is still an incredibly small number. If the Evo models represent some of the strongest biosecurity measures in the field—simply by having any safeguards at all—yet remain easily circumventable, this suggests a fundamental gap in how the wider BDT ecosystem approaches biological risk mitigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nucleic-acid-synthesis-screening-limitations-to-a-list-based-approach&quot;&gt;Nucleic Acid Synthesis Screening: Limitations to a List-Based Approach&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, there are other hurdles at various stages of bioweapons development beyond generating a suitably infectious and lethal viral sequence. For one, even if a BDT such as Evo 2 could simulate infectious organisms, a malicious actor would still need to acquire the physical strands of DNA (step 2 in Figure 3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately (from a security standpoint), some of the barriers are falling here, too. With technological advancements in synthetic biology, commercial firms can now “print” and ship custom-made synthetic nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) sequences around the world. As one synthesis company advertises, “If you know what you want, we will build it.” Customers can place orders over the internet and receive their synthetic nucleic acid sample for a few cents per base pair (the fundamental unit of nucleic acids) within two-to-four business days. Thus, the previously mentioned viral horsepox DNA was acquired for as little as $100,000 in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government has issued guidelines for DNA synthesis firms to mitigate biosecurity risks from this rapidly growing industry. As of the time of writing, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the OSTP have published three major frameworks since 2010 to encourage companies to screen synthesis orders for harmful genetic content. The 2023 HHS Framework, the most robust set of government guidelines to date, is outlined in bullet points below and illustrated in Figure 4. All three HHS and OSTP Frameworks, as well as notes on the Trump administration’s May 5, 2025, executive order directing OSTP and relevant agencies to revise or replace the 2024 OSTP Framework (also outlined in the AI Action Plan), are summarized in Appendix B and Appendix C, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2023-hhs-screening-framework-guidance&quot;&gt;2023 HHS Screening Framework Guidance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, HHS updated its earlier 2010 guidance to reflect advancements in biotechnology capabilities, the growing synthesis industry, and an expanding set of associated biosecurity risks. This resulted in the Screening Framework Guidance for Providers and Users of Synthetic Nucleic Acids, the most widely referenced U.S. government framework for synthesis screening to date. The 2023 HHS framework issues recommendations for actors across the synthesis supply chain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Providers&lt;/strong&gt; should screen all nucleic acid (i.e., single and double-stranded DNA and RNA) sequences for “best matches” to federally regulated agents, except when the sequence is also found in an unregulated organism or toxin. Moreover, “as soon as it is practical to do so,” they should screen for nonregulated agents known to boost pathogenicity or toxicity in an organism. These sequences of concern (SOCs) are discussed in more detail below.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Providers and customers&lt;/strong&gt; should verify, track, and record any transfer of SOCs beyond the intended end user.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Providers and equipment manufacturers&lt;/strong&gt; should strengthen cyber and informational security measures to protect intellectual property and customer information.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equipment manufacturers&lt;/strong&gt; should perform customer-screening processes, integrate SOC screening capabilities into equipment, and take security measures to ensure equipment cannot be overridden by unauthorized actors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/z4LGgMb.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 4: Simplified Step-by-Step Illustration of the 2023 HHS Screening Framework for Nucleic Acid Synthesis Providers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these frameworks are a commendable first step, they could soon become obsolete due to the increasing convergence of AI and biotechnology. Imagine the following scenario in the not-too-distant future: A DNA synthesis company receives a request from a customer asking it to produce a sequence. Following the latest government guidelines, a company employee dutifully screens the sequence against the company’s database of SOCs, including federally regulated agents and toxins. Nothing is flagged. However, it is plausible that the customer used an AI tool to develop this sequence—these tools are increasingly popular among scientists, and the employee has heard of other recent instances in which SOC databases did not catch harmful AI-generated sequences. Still, government guidelines technically indicate that nothing is wrong. How should the employee proceed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scenario may seem dramatic, but it is already frighteningly close to reality. In December 2024, experts representing several major biotechnology companies and biosecurity organizations published a study in which they stated that widely available AI protein models are “now making it possible to generate . . . proteins potentially hundreds of mutations away from the closest known natural protein.” To test whether these AI-generated proteins could circumnavigate synthesis companies’ screening tools, the authors generated tens of thousands of harmful sequences that were functionally equivalent to but sequentially different from known SOCs. They then fed these sequences through biosecurity screening software (BSS) used by commercial providers in a secure and confidential environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors reported that several companies’ software, “including screening methods in use at major nucleic acid suppliers, could not reliably detect such AI-reformulated toxins and viral proteins,” with “up to 100% of variants from certain proteins passing undetected through at least one BSS.” By adjusting the screening software, including integrating a model that can recognize signs of AI-generated protein variants, the authors were ultimately able to significantly boost detection rates up to 97 percent. Still, the study concluded that “in the long run, we should not expect sequence-based [biosecurity] strategies alone—like those tested and developed in this study—will be sufficient, as we envision a future in which AI-assisted generation of proteins produces sequences unlike any seen in nature.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, both this study as well as the future scenario provided above serve to highlight three key limitations with current U.S. government screening guidelines. These are outlined briefly below and described in greater detail in Appendix D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The current list of 63 regulated agents and toxins will likely fail to detect the possibly infinite new or modified pathogens designed by future BDTs.&lt;/strong&gt; To date, there are only 63 regulated toxins, pathogens, and bacteria on the Select Agents and Toxins List compiled by HHS and Department of Agriculture (USDA). When including export-controlled items on the Bureau of Industry and Security’s Commerce Control List for international orders, there are only approximately 150 unique items.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In theory, the frameworks’ screening mechanisms work until an AI model creates the 64th (or, for international orders, say the 151st) deadly organism that is not yet on one of these lists. There are thus serious risks that these lists of regulated sequences are an increasingly inadequate line of defense, especially when just one sufficiently different genomic sequence could be enough to unleash a highly contagious virus or even start the next global pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Indeed, an April 2025 report commissioned by Congress from the National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnology (NSCEB) called current U.S. biosecurity measures like the regulated agents lists “blunt and reactive” for this reason. A 2018 biodefense report from NASEM went further, arguing that this “overreliance on the Select Agent list is a systemic weakness affecting many aspects of the United States’ current biodefense mitigation capability.” Even the 2023 HHS framework recognized this shortcoming, acknowledging that advancements in biotechnology may assist users with “engineering pathogenic or toxic proteins with completely novel sequences . . . that are not a match to any known sequence.” Concerningly, the framework leaves it up to providers to develop best practices to address such issues themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Efforts to expand synthesis-screening protocols to capture additional sequences of concern are nascent and could quickly fall behind AI-generated sequence capabilities.&lt;/strong&gt; Among the largest updates to U.S. government guidelines on synthesis screening in recent years has been to encourage providers to expand the scope of their screening processes to include additional harmful, nonregulated genetic sequences. While this is commendable for improving biosecurity in theory, there are several key challenges to implementing it in practice:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There is currently no consensus among industry and government stakeholders regarding what constitutes an SOC.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There is no standardized database of SOCs beyond federally regulated lists.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The generative capabilities of future AI biology models threaten to make new or existing SOC databases continuously incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current government frameworks encourage providers and other actors to develop their own security best practices, increasing the likelihood of a fragmented biosecurity landscape in which companies who skimp on safety hold a competitive cost or speed advantage over those who implement more rigorous measures.&lt;/strong&gt; Despite iterating security best practices for over a decade, U.S. government guidelines for DNA synthesis companies remain largely high level. While high-level guidance arguably increases flexibility and reduces the regulatory burden for large companies, it may leave smaller companies to develop their own protocols from scratch. Thus, these guidelines serve as stopgap measures at best, rather than detailed instructions for synthesis companies.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Patchwork efforts may also inadvertently punish good actors that adopt stricter security measures. Companies report high costs associated with adhering to current government screening guidelines, which are expected to become an increasingly large part of synthesis companies’ total overhead costs. In a worst-case scenario, high screening costs would give companies commercial incentives to cut corners on safety best practices. This same dynamic could play out at a global scale: Customers could exploit the current lack of international synthesis security standards and choose foreign providers that employ more relaxed measures, if any, to produce dangerous sequences abroad. As the Covid-19 pandemic showed, highly contagious pathogens from anywhere can quickly become a health crisis everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AI Action Plan rightly identifies U.S. government investment into biosecurity as an essential component to the United States’ national security strategy. In practice, however, treading the line between mitigating viral sequences used to cause catastrophe while enabling those used for life-saving research is undoubtedly challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. policymakers have the tough job of ensuring biosecurity measures are stringent enough that bad actors cannot develop bioweapons, but not so stringent that they limit good actors from developing genetic sequences—including pathogenic ones—for beneficial scientific efforts such as drug discovery or vaccine development (see Figure 5). Lawmakers also have the dual responsibility of strengthening biosecurity practices without adding undue burden to companies working in the AI, DNA synthesis, or other sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/emjIRTR.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 5: Simplified Biosecurity Policy Matrix&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To avoid undermining U.S. competitiveness in biotechnology, policymakers should at least enhance security measures that are no more burdensome than existing requirements (and are ideally less burdensome). They should also carefully consider the potential opportunity costs of constraining frontier AI and biotechnology innovation with stricter security measures. This requires developing targeted policy interventions that do not stifle commercial AI and biotechnology progress or unduly disrupt academic autonomy. Finally, given the inherently global nature of biorisk and biosecurity, robust mitigation measures demand international engagement with a wide variety of stakeholders from lower-, middle-, and high-income countries alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If developed and implemented thoughtfully, clear and proportionate safeguards could accelerate biotechnology innovation and adoption by building trust and helping seize the incredible promises that AI holds for the scientific and biomedical fields. What follows are three recommendations the authors believe would strengthen biosecurity in the age of AI without slowing down the U.S. AI or biotechnology industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-us-lawmakers-should-fund-nist-and-caisi-to-continue-and-expand-their-critical-ai-and-biosecurity-work&quot;&gt;1. U.S. lawmakers should fund NIST and CAISI to continue and expand their critical AI and biosecurity work.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. government guidelines will require continuous revision and updating as AI increasingly poses novel risks to biosecurity, including but not limited to the threats assessed in this paper. Moreover, the scope of AI-enabled biosecurity risks will shift over time as new models develop new capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reality demands government expertise, capacity, and industry engagement that the National Institute of Standards and Technology and, within it, the recently announced U.S. Center for AI Standards and Innovation (formerly the AI Safety Institute) are well-positioned to meet. These institutions are doing unique and urgently needed work to prevent the misuse of AI and synthetic biology for deliberate and accidental biological attacks. Ongoing biosecurity-related efforts at NIST and CAISI include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NIST:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;developing high-level requirements for SOC databases, including standardize metadata and database access requirements, in partnership with the Engineering Biology Research Consortium (EBRC) and other relevant stakeholders;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;developing test datasets and benchmarking tools to assess and maintain the performance of nucleic acid synthesis tools;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;working to harmonize global nucleic acid sequence–screening practices within the International Organization for Standardization ISO and other standards-development organizations; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;advancing AI capabilities to enable the prediction of how sequences will function (specifically developing standard methods for the collection of large, high-quality datasets for training and testing AI tools).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CAISI:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;conducting pre-deployment evaluations of U.S. and foreign commercial AI models for capabilities and demonstrable risks to national security, including biological risks;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;working with NIST organizations to develop guidelines, best practices, and voluntary standards for measuring and improving the security of AI systems; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;coordinating with other federal agencies and authorities, including the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, and the Office of Science and Technology Policy, to conduct AI system evaluations and assessments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NIST and CAISI have already received clear federal mandates to lead critical AI and biosecurity initiatives. Most recently, the AI Action Plan identifies NIST and CAISI as primary contacts within the U.S. government to lead security testing of frontier AI models for biological and other national security risks, demonstrating continuity with the Biden administration’s 2024 national security memorandum (NSM) on AI. However, the AI Action Plan also expands the scope of NIST and CAISI’s responsibilities beyond those listed in the NSM, such as helping to monitor foreign frontier AI developments with potential U.S. national security implications and developing “financial markets” for compute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet just as the Trump administration is tasking NIST and CAISI with deeper and broader responsibilities under the Action Plan, it is also proposing significant reductions in their budgets. President Trump’s fiscal year 2026 budget recommendations to Congress proposed a $325 million cut to NIST’s funding—a nearly 30 percent reduction from its FY 2025 budget of around $1 billion—citing the agency’s longstanding support of the “radical climate agenda.”. As part of this proposal, scientific and technical research and services would see a nearly 17 percent cut compared to the FY 2025 budget, as well as a reported elimination of nearly 500 full-time employees and a further $10 million in pay cuts to remaining staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, the specific NIST offices that stand to be the most impacted by these proposed cuts are unclear. Given the importance of CAISI to the AI Action Plan, it is likely that the center will be shielded from the worst effects of the proposed FY 2026 budget cuts. Indeed, the plan recommends that the government prioritize recruiting top AI research talent to federal agencies including NIST and CAISI, rather than cutting staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But recruiting and retaining top AI talent requires significant investment from the U.S. government, not budget cuts and layoffs. Highly competitive industry salaries already make attracting AI researchers to government service challenging, and executing the expanded scope of NIST and CAISI’s responsibilities under the AI Action Plan will demand more talent and funding, not less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, shrinking NIST’s budget and expertise would further degrade the U.S. government’s ability to prepare for and respond to biorisks just as the FY 2026 budget proposal threatens enormous cuts to other health, safety, and biosecurity-related agencies, including the National Institutes of Health (−$18 billion), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (−$3.6 billion), and the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (−$240 million). It would also coincide with increasingly dwindling staff across key federal biosecurity-related agencies and a leaderless White House Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy following the recent resignation of top official Gerald Parker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the Trump administration is as serious about investing in biosecurity as AI Action Plan claims, it should not underfund NIST and by extension CAISI—two of its greatest technical resources. At a minimum, U.S. policymakers and lawmakers should reconsider the proposed 30 percent reduction in NIST funding, especially given its proposed cuts to other relevant agencies responsible for population health and biosecurity. Better yet, lawmakers should look to authorize additional funding for NIST (and by extension CAISI) given the administration’s goals to recruit talent and expand the institutions’ evaluation and research work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-caisi-should-leverage-the-interagency-testing-risks-of-ai-for-national-security-trains-taskforce-and-the-international-network-of-ai-safety-institutes-to-develop-evaluations-of-frontier-bdts-for-high-impact-capabilities&quot;&gt;2. CAISI should leverage the interagency Testing Risks of AI for National Security (TRAINS) Taskforce and the international network of AI Safety Institutes to develop evaluations of frontier BDTs for high-impact capabilities.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advancements in BDTs pose unique risks to U.S. biosecurity that should be monitored carefully as they evolve (see the section of this paper on BDTs above). CAISI should conduct BDT model evaluations to monitor frontier BDTs for emerging high-impact biological capabilities, including but not limited to novel pathogen design and modifying existing pathogens to evade screening procedures. Such evaluations would directly support CAISI’s stated goal of mitigating demonstrable national security risks, including biosecurity threats, as well as the AI Action Plan’s recommendation that the federal government develop national security-related AI evaluations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To avoid stifling innovation, only the most powerful BDTs should require testing, defined by proxy metrics such as training-compute thresholds and training-dataset size. To capture the full breadth of the frontier BDT landscape, testing should encompass commercial frontier models, models developed by noncommercial organizations (including universities and nonprofits as in the case of Evo 2), and models released under noncommercial licenses (such as ESM3-open).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do so, CAISI may need to expand its recently narrowed focus on commercial AI systems. It is currently unclear whether CAISI’s definition of commercial systems exclusively covers AI systems developed by companies, such as LLMs produced by OpenAI and Anthropic, or nonprofit-developed and noncommercially licensed systems as well. To capture the broadest array of high-impact frontier AI systems, CAISI should employ this expanded definition of commercial systems in its evaluations and research on frontier biological models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CAISI need not develop BDT evaluation capabilities alone. Rather, it should look to other relevant agencies and existing resources such as the interagency TRAINS Taskforce, dedicated to conducting research and testing of AI models across national security and public safety domains, including for biosecurity risks (see Figure 6). The TRAINS Taskforce was already chaired by the former U.S. AI Safety Institute, offering the opportunity for continuity with the new CAISI. Furthermore, it brings in other agencies with important expertise and resources relevant to AI biological evaluations, including the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/evst12a.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 6: Organizational Chart of the TRAINS Taskforce&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internationally, CAISI could tap into the global network of AI Safety Institutes for additional capacity and expertise from trusted partners abroad. While some BDTs developed by U.S. entities may be restricted to testing within the United States due to security and intellectual property reasons, there are nevertheless many open-source models that can be effectively researched and evaluated for biosecurity risks elsewhere. International cooperation and information sharing on this issue could also help enhance the United States’ understanding of foreign AI biology capabilities and harmonize model-evaluation metrics important for setting global standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-ostp-and-other-relevant-agencies-should-develop-a-plan-to-integrate-ai-capabilities-into-a-standardized-synthesis-screening-system-for-us-synthesis-providers&quot;&gt;3. OSTP and other relevant agencies should develop a plan to integrate AI capabilities into a standardized synthesis-screening system for U.S. synthesis providers.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus far, this paper has highlighted a future in which AI biology models with capabilities like Evo 2’s could soon help malicious actors develop entirely new categories of bioweapons. However, such models also present an exciting opportunity for strengthening U.S. biodefense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A future AI biology tool with advanced predictive capabilities to determine sequence structures, functions, and mutational effects could be applied to identify and model potential pathogens. DNA synthesis companies could leverage these capabilities in their screening processes to simulate whether variations in genetic sequences would increase pathogenic or toxic traits, how a novel genetic sequence would behave, and to flag new sequences of concern before synthesis even occurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a future AI biology model with improved predictive capabilities like Evo 2’s, synthesis companies could screen all sequence orders to determine whether it does the following&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;matches a federally regulated sequence;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;matches a known SOC outside of this list; and/or&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;would imply novel pathogenic or toxic functions that could constitute a new SOC within a certain confidence interval (CI).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6Lcpr6h.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 7: Simplified Illustration of a Hypothetical AI-Enabled Nucleic Acid Screening Process Using an AI Biology Model&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The model could then take appropriate next steps according to the sequence’s biosecurity risk following a tiered system (see Figure 7):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low Risk&lt;/strong&gt;: Known or novel sequences with no structural similarity to known pathogens or toxins. Sequences would be logged but cleared for synthesis without delay.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medium Risk&lt;/strong&gt;: Sequences with some structural similarities to known agents, such as attenuated sequences used in vaccines, but below critical thresholds. These might trigger a customer screening follow-up, such as confirming researcher credentials or requesting further project information.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Risk&lt;/strong&gt;: Sequences that closely resemble known pathogens or that the AI predicts would exhibit harmful properties within a certain confidence interval (CI). These sequences could require explicit approval from a government authority or the customer to provide credentials before synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extreme Risk&lt;/strong&gt;: Known or novel sequences confidently predicted (e.g., at an 80 percent CI or higher) to have pathogenic/toxic characteristics of a pandemic or similarly extreme scale. This category would halt synthesis and alert U.S. government authorities of the sequence order.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional considerations for a government-led AI-enabled synthesis-screening system, including security issues, outstanding challenges, and an example of an earlier government effort to integrate AI into synthesis screening—such as the Functional Genomic and Computational Assessment of Threats (Fun GCAT) run by the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA)—are outlined in Appendix D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI promises to revolutionize the field of biology and bring enormous benefits to humanity. But rapid advancements in LLMs and BDTs also pose new and emerging biosecurity threats, and current U.S. biosecurity measures are ill-equipped to meet these challenges. Experts warn that critical safeguards embedded within BDT models are already circumventable post-deployment, suggesting grim implications as model capabilities improve, and U.S. government guidelines for list-based synthesis screening measures remain blunt tools that will likely fail to detect future AI-generated sequences that do not match known agents and toxins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration has made promising first steps by addressing these challenges in its AI Action Plan and May 2025 executive order. However, the real test will be how quickly it is able to translate its high-level recommendations into actionable policies that keep pace with technological breakthroughs. U.S. policymakers also face the undoubtedly tough job of preventing biothreats while also minimizing opportunity costs by adding further burdens to industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recommendations outlined in this paper will help the United States to pursue such a high-return, low-cost biodefense strategy. As the barriers to bioterrorism continue to fall in the age of AI, U.S. policymakers must strive to ensure that developing bioweapons remains as difficult and costly as possible. The actions they take may determine whether bioterrorism remains the realm of a few evil geniuses, or whether it falls within reach of evil morons as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of the time of writing, the U.S. government has issued three major frameworks to encourage synthesis providers to screen incoming orders for harmful genetic content. These frameworks are outlined in high-level bullet points below. Comments on the Trump administration’s upcoming framework can be found in Appendix C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2010: HHS Screening Framework Guidance for Providers of Synthetic Double-Stranded DNA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2010, HHS issued the first comprehensive set of government guidelines to establish baseline safety and security best practices around double-stranded DNA technology. The voluntary framework encouraged synthesis companies (which they call “providers”) to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Verify customer identities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Screen all orders for sequences derived from or encoding regulated sequences listed in the HHS/USDA Select Agents and Toxins List and, for international orders, the Bureau of Industry and Security’s CCL.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conduct follow-up screenings if a customer or sequence order raises concerns and contact U.S. authorities if appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maintain records of all screening protocols, customers, orders, and sequence information for a minimum of eight years.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2023 HHS Screening Framework Guidance for Providers and Users of Synthetic Nucleic Acids&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, HHS updated the 2010 guidance to reflect advancements in biotechnology capabilities, the growing synthesis industry, and an expanding set of associated biosecurity risks. Updates encourage actors across the synthesis supply chain to undertake the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Providers: Screen all nucleic acid (i.e., single and double-stranded DNA and RNA) sequences for “best matches” to federally regulated agents, except when the sequence is also found in an unregulated organism or toxin. Additionally, “as soon as it is practical to do so,” screen for SOCs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Providers and customers: Verify, track, and record any transfer of SOCs beyond the intended end user.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Providers and equipment manufacturers: Strengthen cyber and informational security measures to protect intellectual property and customer information.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Equipment manufacturers: Perform customer screening processes, integrate SOC screening capabilities into equipment, and take security measures to ensure equipment cannot be overridden by unauthorized actors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2024 OSTP Framework for Nucleic Acid Synthesis Screening&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October 2023, the Biden-Harris AI executive order (Executive Order 14110) instructed OSTP to establish a new framework for screening synthetic nucleic acid sequences in consultation with HHS and other federal agencies. The resulting framework largely continues earlier 2023 HHS guidance for screening customers and sequence orders, with a few additional updates for providers and manufacturers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Providers: Post a statement on the provider’s website that it adheres to the screening framework and/or provide a copy to federally funded customers or federal agencies upon request.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Providers and equipment manufacturers: Report potentially illegal orders detected in the screening process to appropriate U.S. authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Providers and equipment manufacturers: Enhance cyber and supply chain security in accordance with NIST’s Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for Systems and Organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;appendix-c-notes-on-the-trump-administrations-forthcoming-updates-to-the-2024-ostp-framework-for-nucleic-acid-synthesis-screening&quot;&gt;Appendix C: Notes on the Trump Administration’s Forthcoming Updates to the 2024 OSTP Framework for Nucleic Acid Synthesis Screening&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On May 5, 2025, President Trump issued an executive order on Improving the Safety and Security of Biological Research with important updates to U.S. government guidelines on nucleic acid synthesis screening. The executive order directs the director of OSTP, in coordination with the assistant to the president for national security affairs (APNSA) and the heads of relevant agencies, to revise or replace the Biden administration’s 2024 OSTP framework within 90 days. While most of the details about this update are not yet public, the executive order provides a preview of three notable changes to the existing government guidance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Expansion of the framework to include non-federally funded entities: Within 180 days of the executive order, the director of OSTP, in coordination with APNSA, the Office of Management and Budget, and other relevant agencies, will develop and implement an updated framework that includes non-federally funded entities. This expands the scope of the Biden administration’s 2024 framework, which applied only to federally funded research entities (representing the majority of all synthesis orders), to also include the private sector. Any gaps in executive branch authorities to meet this objective will be addressed through a legislative proposal within the 180-day period.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enforcement requirements: The updated framework will also mandate enforcement provisions in every life science research contract or grant award. This includes terms requiring the contract signatory or grant recipient to:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Comply with the executive order and other applicable regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Certify that they do not operate, participate in, or fund any dangerous gain-of-function research or other life science research in foreign countries that could cause significant societal consequences or generate unnecessary national security risks.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Acknowledge that a violation of the terms of this executive order or other applicable regulations may also constitute a violation by the signatory or recipient’s employer or institution, potentially subjecting them to the immediate revocation of ongoing federal funding and a five-year bar from future federal life sciences grants.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Framework revision timelines: Moving forward, OSTP and other relevant agencies will review and revise the updated framework at least every four years or as appropriate, instead of every two years as the 2024 framework states.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the forthcoming framework will fulfil the Trump administration’s first recommendation in the “Invest in Biosecurity” section of the AI Action Plan on this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;appendix-d-limitations-to-current-hhs-and-ostp-frameworks-for-nucleic-acid-synthesis-screening-expanded-version&quot;&gt;Appendix D: Limitations to Current HHS and OSTP Frameworks for Nucleic Acid Synthesis Screening (Expanded Version)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The current list of 63 regulated agents and toxins will likely fail to detect the possibly infinite new pathogens made by BDTs.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;To date, there are only 63 regulated toxins, pathogens, and bacteria on the HHS/USDA Select Agents and Toxins List. When including export-controlled items on the Bureau of Industry and Security’s CCL for international orders, there are only roughly 150 unique items.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In theory, the frameworks’ screening mechanisms work until an AI model creates the 64th (or, for international orders, say the 150st) deadly organism that is not yet on one of these lists. There are thus serious risks that these lists of regulated sequences are an increasingly inadequate line of defense, especially when just one sufficiently different genomic sequence could be enough to start the next global pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Indeed, an April 2025 report commissioned by Congress from the NSCEB calls current U.S. biosecurity measures like the regulated agents lists “blunt and reactive” for this reason. A 2018 biodefense report from NASEM goes further, arguing that this “overreliance on the Select Agent list is a systemic weakness affecting many aspects of the United States’ current biodefense mitigation capability.” Even the 2023 HHS framework recognizes this shortcoming, acknowledging that advancements in biotechnology may assist users with “engineering pathogenic or toxic proteins with completely novel sequences . . . that are not a match to any known sequence.” Concerningly, the framework leaves it up to providers to develop best practices to address such issues themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Efforts to expand synthesis-screening protocols to capture additional SOCs are nascent and could also quickly fall behind AI-generated sequences.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Among the biggest updates to U.S. government guidelines on synthesis screening in recent years has been to encourage providers to expand the scope of their screening processes beyond the Select Agents and Toxins List and CCL. In 2023, the updated HHS framework acknowledged that current lists of federally regulated agents&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;do not represent the entirety of potential risks to public health . . . that could arise from the misuse of synthetic nucleic acids. Non-regulated pathogens and toxins, as well as other novel types of nucleic acid sequences, may also pose significant risks if they are misused. To minimize these risks, a shift is needed from relying solely on lists of regulated pathogens and toxins to also assessing the risks associated with other nucleic acid sequences that may contribute to pathogenicity or harm if introduced into new genetic frameworks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The 2023 framework adds that the expanded definition of SOCs should take effect “as soon as it is practical to do so,” while the subsequent OSTP framework set the specific deadline of October 13, 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Encouraging providers to cast a wider net in their screening protocols marks a shift from a taxonomy-based approach (whether a sequence specifically matches the biological classification of a regulated organism) to a risk-based one (whether it can cause harmful effects writ large). While this may be a good idea for improving biosecurity in theory, there are several key challenges to implementing it in practice:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;2a. There is currently no consensus among industry and government stakeholders regarding what constitutes an SOC. Even U.S. government guidelines disagree: The 2023 HHS framework states that an SOC includes sequences that “may contribute to pathogenicity or harm if introduced into new genetic frameworks,” whereas the 2024 OSTP version states that an SOC covers sequences that are concretely “known to contribute to pathogenicity or toxicity.” These differences in definition may seem small but could matter a lot when determining which sequences do or do not get screened and how companies approach their safety mitigation requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;2b. There is no standardized database of SOCs beyond regulated lists. Indeed, the 2023 HHS framework recognizes that such a database “may not yet exist” and encourages providers to develop their own. Fortunately, there are already several search tools and databases for screening sequence orders. For example, the HHS National Center for Biotechnology Information’s (NCBI’s) freely accessible Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) compares sequences to NCBI geneticdatabases (including viral ones) and determines the statistical significance between matches. Similarly, the commercial screening platform ThreatSEQ checks DNA orders against an SOC database it claims covers 100 percent of regulated agents and “virtually all known bacterial human/zoonotic pathogens.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Individually, these are valuable screening resources. However, the multiplicity of these datasets also risks creating a patchwork of variable screening methods depending on the different assumptions and sequences each includes. A January 2025 report from the EBRC notes the following:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Different screening philosophies, threat models, and perspectives can greatly influence what is or is not included in a SOC database, even when a database developer is trying to only include biosecurity relevant sequences from regulated organisms. For example, amongst existing screening tools, some assume a sequence from a regulated agent is “innocent until proven guilty.” Other tools assume these sequences are “guilty until proven innocent,” which would greatly expand both the number and types of sequences of concern in a database.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The report concludes that “screening would likely be more consistent across Providers if their screening systems referenced the same SOC database(s).” Similarly, a 2020 HHS survey states that most in industry find the HHS BLAST adequate for screening, but that “the lack of a definitive database of biothreat sequences was identified as a gap” in U.S. biosecurity.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;2c. The generative capabilities of BDTs threaten to make new or existing SOC databases continuously incomplete. Currently, SOC databases rely upon published scientific research to determine whether a sequence should be included in the dataset. This is a time- and research-intensive approach that can create multiple gaps in the database and contribute to a static infrastructure for pathogen detection. According to the February 2025 EBRC report:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It is not uncommon for developers of SOC databases to find previously published papers that cause them to add a sequence or change its annotation [in a database]. . . . New research is constantly published that may impact whether a given sequence is considered “of concern.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Thus, the report concludes that developing a comprehensive database of SOCs would&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;require significant resources to comprehensively reflect all SOCs in the published literature. . . . Even if a database developer was able to accomplish such a feat, the database would quickly become outdated without significant investment in its maintenance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;AI may soon compound this issue, potentially generating novel pathogens faster than scientists can publish articles. Compared to typical timelines in AI, publishing in scientific journals occurs at a snail’s pace. By the time scientists have studied a new AI-generated viral sequence, then published a paper that may (or may not) be incorporated into an SOC database, it could be too late. Imagine, for instance, a scenario in which synthesis companies manufacture an AI-generated viral sequence simply because a scientific paper is held up in a lengthy peer review process. This assumes that scientists are even aware of the novel sequence—most malicious actors are unlikely to write academic papers on their plans, at least not without executing them first.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Current government frameworks encourage providers and other actors to develop their own security best practices, increasing the likelihood of a fragmented biosecurity landscape in which companies who skimp on safety hold a competitive advantage over those who implement more rigorous measures.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Despite iterating security best practices for over a decade, U.S. government guidelines for DNA synthesis companies remain largely high level. Of the three frameworks published as of the time of writing, only the 2010 HHS document was longer than 14 pages. These frameworks are so short principally because they place substantial responsibility on providers, manufacturers, and other actors to develop their own best practices.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;While high-level guidance arguably increases flexibility and reduces the regulatory burden for large companies, it may leave smaller companies to develop their own protocols from scratch. Thus, these guidelines serve at best as stopgap measures rather than detailed instructions for synthesis companies.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, several ongoing initiatives are working to coordinate and standardize synthesis-screening best practices. For example, the International Gene Synthesis Consortium, an industry-led organization, proactively shares processes and screens orders against a communal database of internationally regulated pathogens and toxins. According to the consortium, it represents “approximately 80% of gene synthesis capacity worldwide,” with members including multinational biotech firms such as GenScript as well as smaller synthesis labs. Similarly, the International Biosecurity and Biosafety Initiative for Science and the Bio Funders Compact, led by the Nuclear Threat Initiative and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, are working to integrate biosecurity best practices into the bioscience research and development lifecycle. Furthermore, NIST is currently working with international standards-development organizations and the EBRC to develop global best practices for screening protocols and tools (see the recommendations section of this paper).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Efforts to coordinate synthesis safety protocols are commendable, but they also demonstrate the incompleteness of government efforts to date. Leaving companies to develop their own best practices could encourage a patchwork of security measures and ultimately a fragmented biosecurity landscape, in which malicious actors could shop around for providers with the laxest safeguards and industry would generate no meaningful economies of scale in implementing screening methodologies.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Indeed, patchwork efforts could inadvertently punish good actors that adopt stricter security measures. In 2024, HHS officials published a review of industry and other stakeholder feedback, which informed the updated 2023 HHS framework, reporting:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;According to respondents, implementing the 2010 screening framework is expensive, costing ~$15/order, and this cost has remained flat over the years whereas the cost of synthesis has decreased. Cost is reportedly driven by the need for a PhD in Bioinformatics to interpret sequence hits.The burden of screening may be expected to increase as the size of databases against which to match BLAST sequences is increasing (i.e., as the definition of SOCs expands beyond solely sequences from regulated pathogens and toxins). Providers indicated that they need new annotated data resources, tools, and approaches to keep biosecurity from becoming a leading component of the per-bp [base pair] cost, given that nucleic acid synthesis costs have consistently decreased over time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Currently, 15 dollars per order seems a small price for safety given that sequence orders typically start at tens of thousands of dollars. However, as the DNA synthesis industry expands and the cost of synthesis falls, the fixed price of adhering to government frameworks could represent an increasingly large part of synthesis companies’ total overhead costs. Companies report that current screening software products still require substantial manual oversight from highly trained experts to monitor and sort hard-to-read sequence hits, particularly false positives. The associated labor costs and the computational intensity of current products make screening expensive and hard to scale.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In a worst-case scenario, high screening costs would give companies who skimp on safety a competitive advantage over those who implement more stringent safety best practices. Indeed, this is what industry aims to avoid. In 2023, the CSIS Bipartisan Alliance for Global Health Security—a biosecurity consortium including senior members of Congress, industry experts, and biosecurity scholars—noted that “private industry is reportedly asking for mandated screening of DNA synthesis orders to ensure responsible actors are not financially penalized for implementing safeguards of their own volition.” (See Appendix C for upcoming enforcement provisions under the 2025 Trump executive order.)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;More recently, the April 2025 NSCEB report states that “while industry is united in calling for a measured, enforceable, and standardized approach [to synthesis screening], the U.S. government is unable to respond to such requests with the needed agility” to make this happen. This is because current government policies are split between multiple federal agencies, “leading to redundancies, gaps, and inefficiencies” in biosecurity, including U.S. government screening guidelines. Thus, the commission concludes that current U.S. biosecurity measures place “undue burden on researchers and innovators to navigate unwieldly bureaucratic processes while enduring market and academic pressures.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, biosecurity measures such as synthesis screening are fragmented at a global level as well. For now, U.S. companies dominate the global synthesis market, yet international providers occupy a growing share. U.S. customers could thus exploit the lack of international synthesis security standards and choose foreign providers that employ more relaxed measures to produce dangerous sequences abroad. Foreign actors could similarly choose firms in countries with fewer government guidelines, if any, to synthesize their sequences. Standardized synthesis requirements for U.S. companies alone are therefore not a catchall solution to addressing international biosecurity challenges, especially given that epidemics and pandemics can naturally transcend borders.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;appendix-e-additional-considerations-for-an-ai-enabled-synthesis-screening-process&quot;&gt;Appendix E: Additional Considerations for an AI-Enabled Synthesis-Screening Process&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Building on Earlier U.S. Government Research: IARPA’s Fun GCAT Program&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In looking to develop an effective synthesis-screening process, government and industry stakeholders need not start from scratch. Previous government-sponsored research demonstrates that an AI-enabled screening tool is not only possible but has been achieved before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 2017 to 2022, the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) ran a program to develop an AI-enabled DNA sequence-screening software that would be able to predict sequence functions and gauge potential threats. This Functional Genomic and Computational Assessment of Threats program aimed to replace what its developers called “inadequate” screening methods with a suite of computational tools that could assess dynamic and emerging biological threats. As one 2016 IARPA document introducing the program rightly stated, “We have little or no capacity to deal with novel, emerging, or unknown sequences.” Thus, what the United States needs is to “be creative, novel and forward looking” by taking “experimental approaches to enable understanding risks of genes” using “advances in computational prediction of [genomic] structure and functions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to IARPA, the program demonstrated significant success while it was operational. As the program website states:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fun GCAT tools are demonstrating high predictive accuracy against increasingly challenging test sets. Benchmarking has demonstrated significant performance increases beyond top winners in a closely related bioinformatic software development global challenge. . . . This enabled a range of Intelligence Community-relevant missions from rapid screening of very large datasets to field-based, targeted analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IARPA’s Fun GCAT program concluded in 2022, but experts told CSIS that it remains well-recognized in the biosecurity community today as a successful program for improving nucleic acid synthesis screening. It offers a proof of concept for an AI-enabled screening model, as well as evidence that the U.S. government already thinks such an idea is worthwhile. The model proposed in this paper would build upon IARPA’s project with the aim of making it available to commercial synthesis companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Security Concerns and Possible Mitigation Measures&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an AI model to be able to screen dangerous sequences effectively, it would need to have the necessary harmful information in its training dataset. This would entail leaving out many of the biosecurity-related guardrails common to commercially available models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because a model of this kind would have dangerous dual-use capabilities, careful consideration is needed regarding model access and ownership. DNA synthesis providers should be able to screen every order using this AI model and do so quickly and cheaply. Providers should thus be granted easy access to the model. However, because of dual-use concerns, only certain credentialed actors should be able to possess an actual copy of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government and industry stakeholders would thus need to develop a mechanism that reconciles the ease of access for providers with strict security controls. One solution could be to store the model in a federal agency–secured cloud—perhaps hosted by the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Defense, or the Department of Commerce—that synthesis providers ping via encrypted channels to screen sequence orders. The model could scan the sequence then automatically send a risk assessment back to the provider (see Figure 7). Allowing only authorized U.S. government officials access this AI model could reduce the likelihood that the model is misused, tampered with, or overridden by malicious actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Outstanding Challenges&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though AI biology models present an exciting opportunity to strengthen U.S. biosecurity, there are limitations to this proposed AI-enabled screening measure. For one, it would only apply to commercial DNA synthesis firms. While these firms currently dominate global DNA synthesis production, a growing number of smaller “benchtop” DNA synthesizers could make it easier to circumvent screening entirely by allowing sufficiently trained users to produce sequences themselves. Though the technology is still maturing, the NSCEB estimated in 2024 that benchtop devices will be able to synthesize DNA sequences the length of the smallest viruses in the next two to five years. As a December 2024 report from the Institute for Progress highlights, expected rapid advancements in benchtop synthesis will pose U.S. biosecurity risks that current government measures are ill-equipped to manage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another outstanding limitation that does not yet have a clear solution is the risk of malicious actors ordering fragments of sequences across multiple companies with the intention of recombining them later. Unfortunately, there is no obvious fix for this issue that would not require excessive compliance burdens for legitimate and benevolent actors. However, the AI Action Plan recommends that OSTP lead the development of a mechanism for synthesis providers to share data regarding customer screening, a recommendation that, if effectively executed, could help to address some of this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the success of this proposed measure clearly requires the continued advancement of biological AI capabilities beyond the current state of BDTs and other AI models. It also requires funding for relevant federal agencies and a clear delineation of agency responsibilities relating to AI and biosecurity. For example, as the 2025 NSCEB report discusses in depth, fragmented agency authorities relating to biosecurity is especially challenging for developing and implementing effective policies. The NSCEB advocates for a centralized agency to oversee U.S. biosecurity policy, a recommendation that the authors of this paper support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, deeper analysis of these complex issues is beyond the scope of this initial paper, and it is why the authors recommend developing only a plan to further integrate AI into synthesis screening. The efficacy of this proposal necessitates close partnerships between U.S. policymakers, industry, and academia on numerous considerations, including but not limited to technological feasibility, industry incentives, and security control measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, an AI-enabled synthesis-screening process should serve as just one component of the wider U.S. biosecurity toolkit rather than a comprehensive solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geopolitical tensions in cyberspace are escalating. There is an urgent need to reassess how the cyber domain can support broader deterrence strategies. However, the effectiveness of deterrence in cyberspace remains contested among scholars and practitioners. While malicious cyber activity targeting critical national infrastructure (CNI) continues to mount – posing increasing risks to the national security of Western states – it remains unclear whether deterrence measures have meaningfully reduced the frequency, scale and severity of these incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although there has been no “catastrophic nationwide cyber attack”, persistent low-level activity – particularly from Russia and China – has targeted a range of CNIs and sectors in the West. This trend risks being obscured by “unrealised and unspecific scaremongering”, leaving policymakers ill-prepared to respond to evolving threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper balances existing prevailing scepticism about the feasibility of cyber deterrence against the growing political imperative to impose consequences – both cyber and non-cyber – on malicious actors. It explores the question: if a state cyber operation led to a Category 1 cyber incident – described by the National Cyber Security Centre as “a cyber attack that causes sustained disruption of essential services or affects national security” – with sustained threat to life, how could the UK and its allies deter an actor from attempting another breach?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper argues that cyber deterrence must be part of an integrated, cross-domain strategy. Deterrence should be understood as a continuum of prevention and response measures – cumulative, iterative, tailored and grey-zone oriented – drawing from lessons across multiple case studies. It particularly considers the implications of cyber operations “pre-positioning” for disruptive or destructive attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-recommendations&quot;&gt;KEY RECOMMENDATIONS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adopt a pragmatic framing of cyber threats, integrating lessons from cross-sector crisis response and developing tailored and actor-specific deterrence strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Balance strategic ambiguity and credible signalling – particularly in determining the red lines of cyber operations and when crossing them may constitute a threat or use of force under international law.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Break inertia and consider a full range of deterrence responses – including swifter, timely and proportionate action to sub-threshold incursions, and complementary measures across economic, diplomatic or even covert domains.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This analysis is based on a rapid evidence assessment and expert consultations. A second RUSI research paper will explore how to frame the effectiveness of different deterrence approaches across case types and threat actors. That paper will also look closely at specific case studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At NATO’s Conference on Cyber Conflict (CyCon) in May 2025, Emily Goldman, senior US cyber strategist for the National Security Agency, announced further details of the US’s evolving approach to tackling malicious cyber activity. The message was clear: “instead of responding and reacting to the opponent’s last move, we want to move proactively, to constrain their options before they act. To interrupt, to frustrate, to complicate their strategy for victory across all geopolitical conditions. We need to seize and hold the initiative and not cede the initiative.” The US has pivoted away from a strategy of deterrence, signalling its ambition to move from “restraint” and “threatening to act” to a more proactive approach. It is symptomatic of the current highly contested threat landscape where cyberspace is an arena to disrupt adversaries, protect national security, conduct espionage and set conditions ahead of future conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same call for proactive strategies can be found elsewhere, albeit continuing to use deterrence language to describe its desired effect. In June 2025, the UK published its Strategic Defence Review (SDR). The once-in-a-decade document sets the vision for UK Defence’s priorities in the years to come and similarly changes the narrative: “moving to warfighting readiness to deter threats and strengthen security in the Euro-Atlantic”. In practice, this means setting forth a tangible plan for a deterrence that is institutionally and operationally “integrated by design”. It also entails a shift: from a domain-exclusive approach to cyber, to the proposed Cyber and Electromagnetic Command (CyberEM), whose purpose is supporting a more proactive footing in this domain and ensuring cross-domain coherence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such developments have not emerged without reason. Western governments have gradually sought to bolster cyber deterrence strategies through the development of policies, frameworks, exercises, sanctions, operations and public cyber attribution statements. However, the drumbeat for further proactive responses – whether labelled as deterrence or not, as in the US’s case – is growing ever louder. This momentum is driven by the intensification of conflict in cyberspace and a growing recognition of the need for greater integration across domains and government sectors. It also reflects an increasingly multipolar and contested geopolitical landscape. Crucially, the scale of cyberattacks and long-term pre-positioning by certain threat actors – including overt and tacit state activity – has further propelled cyber threats to the top of the national security agendas of Western governments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Cyber deterrence” has conventionally focused on deterrence using cyber effects. Now, given the relationship between cyber and wider geopolitics, it makes sense to expand this concept to include deterrence of malicious cyber activity by using all levers of government (diplomatic, economic, military).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the feasibility and effectiveness of deterrence in cyberspace has been contested among scholars and practitioners for some time. The community has therefore been divided on how to even start a dialogue on strategies, let alone judge their effectiveness. Certain perspectives highlight that one purpose of cyber deterrence is to, over time, demonstrably decrease the number of offensive cyber incidents that states conduct. However, measuring effectiveness is challenging: it is difficult to credibly establish causality between deterrence measures and particular outcomes. Even when deterrence strategies – such as naming and shaming, sanctions (for example, seizure of assets and travel bans) or effects-based operations – are part of the state-based toolbox, that does not necessarily mean that the “3 Cs” of deterrence (capability, credibility and communication) have been implemented or are effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it is challenging to operationalise and measure, cyber deterrence remains a critical component of a state’s objective to achieve its defence and national security interests. It is clear that policy lenses are needed to distinguish “unrealised and unspecific scaremongering” from the concerning and specific cyber threats that need to be deterred in a tailored and systematic manner. This is especially important given cases of state-sponsored actors conducting military and intelligence cyber campaigns against a range of CNIs – such as those of Chinese cyber threat actors Volt and Salt Typhoon targeting US networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next stage of this research – to be published in a second RUSI paper – evaluates deterrence interventions over a longer timeframe involving cumulative impacts and effects. This first paper considers a range of circumstances, including where: delivering cyber effects is part of a wider response toolkit; trial and error is part of the process; cyber effects are positioned within a broader set of threats (intentional and non-intentional as well as kinetic and non-kinetic); and the objective of the approach is to maintain a persistent limit to malicious cyber behaviour (slowing, degrading, narrowing and constraining the space for adversarial action). The results of this research point to the need for an approach that combines both compellence (compelling adversaries to take a specific course of action) and deterrence (dissuading adversaries from engaging in a certain activity). Consequently, this paper advocates for cumulative and tailored approaches to deterring malicious cyber activities, using all available government tools to respond to both cyber and non-cyber threats that fall below the threshold of armed conflict. Further research is required to identify the modalities of such deterrence strategies. The second RUSI research paper will explore this in greater detail, including approaches, opportunities and potential risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reinvigorate the debate for this paper, the authors explore a hypothetical question: if a state cyberattack led to a Category 1 cyber incident with sustained threat to life, how could the UK and its allies deter another breach? Following the National Cyber Security Centre’s UK cyber incident categorisation framework, a Category 1 incident is defined as “a cyber-attack which causes sustained disruption of UK essential services or affects UK national security, leading to severe economic or social consequences or to loss of life”. While the paper does not provide a comprehensive or prescriptive answer, it does make some recommendations to spur further policy research. This question is used to “break inertia”, enabling stakeholders to re-envisage a potential new or revised framework for cyber deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors undertook research in three stages: a rapid evidence assessment of the literature informed a baseline analysis of the state of play in the cyber deterrence debate to date; and two rounds of consultation with eight experts for data validation and additional data gathering. These experts, including academics, industry figures and former policy practitioners from the US and the UK, represented a cross-section of the cyber deterrence debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper has three sections. The first section provides a baseline for the response to the research question. It outlines the context of the overarching cyber deterrence debate to date and proposes key components for a cross-domain approach to the topic. The second section responds to the central question and shows how cyber deterrence consequences can be reframed as a spectrum of operations and impacts in the context of a broader deterrence campaign against adversaries. The final section makes recommendations for policymakers and stakeholders interested in deterrence strategies, and highlights challenges and opportunities for future research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-cyber-deterrence-debates-to-date&quot;&gt;THE CYBER DETERRENCE DEBATES TO DATE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;five-views-of-cyber-deterrence&quot;&gt;FIVE VIEWS OF CYBER DETERRENCE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A brief assessment of the conceptual contributions and challenges that have helped to open the “saying and doing” gap in cyber deterrence is needed. Exploring these allows the gap to be narrowed. There are at least five major schools of thought that have emerged in policy and scholarly literature in the past years:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nuclear deterrence analogies for cyber deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cyber deterrence sceptics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Persistent engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Resilience over deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cross-domain deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are not formal “schools” of thought, nor are they mutually exclusive. However, it is critical to understand them – including their limitations – to avoid falling into policy traps and to assess effective integrations of a cumulative and tailored approach to deterrence of malicious cyber activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NUCLEAR DETERRENCE ANALOGIES FOR CYBER DETERRENCE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first school of cyber deterrence has sought to transpose concepts from nuclear deterrence to the cyber domain. Proponents of this approach to deterrence argue that the logic of mutually assured destruction can, under certain conditions, be applied to cyberattacks. In principle, a cyberattack on a CNI could be sufficiently severe to reach a threshold where a state is compelled to react with overwhelming cyber – or analogue – force. Proponents of this perspective view deterrence as effective when it has an absolute effect of stopping a certain action. It also suggests that it is necessary to clearly signal red lines to adversaries and to develop a suite of retaliatory capabilities that establish deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are policy and conceptual risks of comparing cyber to nuclear capabilities. Cyber capabilities are far less damaging than thermonuclear weapons. As such, this brings into question whether cyber can produce the same credible threat of retaliation as a nuclear weapon. Additionally, cyber capabilities are uniquely transitory (they are rendered less useful or even useless if the exploit is fixed). It is therefore difficult to materially display a cyber capability in the same way that a state can with its nuclear assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CYBER DETERRENCE SCEPTICS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second school of thought questions whether it is at all possible to deter state-led cyber operations and other malicious activity in cyberspace. These sceptics argue that deterrence theory has been erroneously applied to cyberspace and is rooted in the historical securitisation of cyberspace as a military domain. They argue that espionage and intelligence – rather than military conquest – analogies are more suited to cyberspace. This approach therefore limits or eliminates the scope for a conventional reading of deterrence by punishment. While low-intensity, persistent attacks in cyberspace are prevalent, these are below the threshold of armed conflict and, according to adopters of this school, are not acts that would typically require stringent deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sceptics note that some of the assumptions about deterrence – such as the ability to signal precise thresholds, and quickly attribute and demonstrate credible retaliation – are often absent in defending critical systems in cyberspace. Adversaries can therefore exploit the ambiguity of thresholds and test the limits of sub-threshold activity, even when this technically subverts laws and undermines sovereignty – especially as there has not been a cyberattack that amounts to the use of force nor a shared interpretation of what that threshold is under international law. Additionally, cyberspace enables obfuscation of agency and, notably, the formal and/or tacit outsourcing of cyber operations to proxies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, dismissing cyber deterrence is also unhelpful. It paralyses policy responses, creating a disconnect with the current political will for, and necessity of, deterrence measures. Moreover, given the evolving threat landscape and recent high-profile case studies of cyber operations (that is, long-term pre-positioning by hostile state actors) and improved technical capabilities (that is, faster and more precise attribution), there may be new opportunities to introduce effective deterrence measures based on the current context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PERSISTENT ENGAGEMENT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third – and more recent – school of thought favours an approach of persistent engagement. This approach follows from the argument that cyberspace is a realm of continuous interaction among adversaries and, therefore, is where cyber operations impose costs and shape behaviours over time. The US Department of Defense’s 2018 Cyber Defence Strategy introduced the notion of persistent engagement. That strategy argued that US Cyber Command has a capacity and responsibility to engage with adversaries to create constant friction and degrade capabilities, thereby deterring malicious action through cumulative effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an alternative to deterrence, proponents of persistent engagement argue that cyberspace is not a domain of restraint and reaction, and therefore deterrence cannot be the central strategy to achieve national interests. These proponents have spurred a debate on persistent engagement is a better paradigm of competition – focusing on interaction rather than solely on escalation. In this regard, they suggest that persistent engagement seeks to inhibit, rather than deter, the cumulative impact of malicious activity in a way that falls short of the equivalent effect brought by armed attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While its proponents define persistent engagement as distinct from deterrence, it is still useful to think about how this school of thought adds to the debate. They argue that conventional deterrence strategies still hold for cyber operations that could lead to Category 1 incidents (or effects equivalent to an armed attack) as states would have the right to respond with conventional force. Persistent engagement therefore complements, in their view, the debate by addressing sub-threshold malicious cyber activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two contributions follow. First, persistent engagement assumes that, over time, operations short of armed conflict can have a strategic-level cumulative impact. This is similar to this paper’s view of cumulative deterrence – albeit persistent engagement distances itself from deterrence. Second, persistent engagement implies less reliance on ad hoc reactions to specific malicious cyber operations, instead proposing a campaigns-based approach – which highlights the iterative and presumably interactional nature of signalling and cost imposition. Some argue that such activity should be carefully calibrated given the risk of escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;RESILIENCE OVER DETERRENCE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another perspective rejects the centrality of deterrence altogether. Instead, this school proposes that states prioritise cyber resilience. It argues that rather than attempting to prevent attacks – an unrealistic goal in an environment of constant probing and penetration – efforts should focus on building (and maintaining) systems that can absorb, adapt to and recover from attacks with minimal disruption. Proponents contend that resilience reduces the attractiveness of cyberattacks by denying attackers the impact that they seek – in effect, a form of deterrence by denial. A range of measures can be used to increase resilience, including (but not limited to): segregation of networks; organisational preparedness; secure backups; and access to rapid incident response capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if this framing is applied exclusively, it shifts the burden almost entirely on to the defender and their third parties – letting the attacker off the hook. A purely resilience-focused approach may potentially embolden attackers who believe their action will carry no political or strategic cost. It also does not respond to the political appetite to impose costs beyond denying ease of access to systems or deployment of capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CROSS-DOMAIN DETERRENCE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fifth school of thought, cross-domain deterrence, views cyber deterrence not as a standalone challenge, but as one part of a broader state toolkit involving multiple domains (that is, military, economic and diplomatic). This perspective holds that cyberattacks can be deterred through retaliatory threats or actions in other domains. These may include conventional military strikes, sanctions or legal indictments. By expanding the menu of response options beyond cyberspace, cross-domain deterrence enhances the credibility and flexibility of deterrent postures. It acknowledges the limitations of cyber-for-cyber responses – especially when involving rivals with asymmetric capacities and vulnerabilities in cyberspace – and instead favours a full-spectrum response to impose costs on malicious actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While cross-domain deterrence may increase a state’s flexibility to signal and incur prospective costs on adversaries, it also assumes a degree of coordination and intentionality in applying deterrence strategies across other areas of government – such as space, economic policy and diplomacy – which remains one of the biggest challenges for policymakers. A full-spectrum view of cyber deterrence requires governments to strengthen their ability to manage risks of escalation and miscalculation in an integrated manner, both across government agencies and in cooperation with the private sector. Cross-domain deterrence also requires: an awareness of the strengths and weaknesses of different means of coercion; a careful assessment of how combining these tools (and their respective strengths and weaknesses) affects the credibility and effectiveness of deterrence and compellence; and a judicious assessment of proportionality and observance of states’ international obligations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;an-integrated-view-of-cyber-deterrence&quot;&gt;AN INTEGRATED VIEW OF CYBER DETERRENCE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the challenges, and as the next sections show, thinking about a cumulative and tailored approach to cross-domain deterrence should be at the forefront of government thinking. Some countries are becoming more vocal about adopting a similar approach, but this does not mean it is a reality. Moreover, moving from words to action will require more legwork if adversary action by Russia, China, Iran, North Korea and others is to be deterred in cyberspace. Figure 1 provides a summary of key components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/VOhCeOx.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reassessing-cyber-deterrence-gradation-of-deterrence-effectiveness&quot;&gt;REASSESSING CYBER DETERRENCE: GRADATION OF DETERRENCE EFFECTIVENESS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the five prevailing views on cyber deterrence reflect a protracted and fragmented discourse, the policy appetite for credible, practical and careful actions remains strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policymakers are encouraged to consider an approach grounded in cumulative deterrence, underpinned by two analytical exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is to view cyber deterrence as a spectrum of prevention and response measures (from low- to high-impact measures) based on lessons learned from existing cases. The second is to position cyber disruptions within a broader non-cyber scale of disruptions (that is, like that for natural disasters) to understand the systemic impact that cyber has in relation to other catastrophic disruptions. This second exercise allows for a proper calibration of preparedness to respond and act. Under such an approach, cyber is not seen through a specific lens, but is instead part of a broader portfolio of diplomatic and strategic engagement between states. The ideal outcome is for policymakers to be able to apply deterrence tools as part of a “tailored” cumulative campaign. That is, long-form deterrence campaigns could be optimised if they were tailored for use against specific states and actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both exercises rest on the premise that political will and context are arguably the most decisive factors for the selection of deterrence mechanisms and changes in posture. Figure 2 illustrates a simplified spectrum of indicative cyber operations to date, including low-, medium- and high-impact examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, there are low-impact cases – those with minimal or no immediate disruption to networks or services per se, but which nonetheless still carry strategic significance. A key example is “pre-positioning”: broadly, the acts that allow a state to infiltrate and establish a foothold in technology and equipment, which then allow it to commit an act of sabotage at a later date. In the context of cyber security, pre-positioning has also included the act of installing malware or introducing vulnerabilities into digital systems without activating the payload. Unlike cyber espionage, which includes some form of data exfiltration, pre-positioning is about maintaining access without revealing the activity and/or the infiltrator’s intentions. Although pre-positioning might be a prelude to greater-impact activity, it would probably be difficult to meaningfully implement a deterrence regime restricted to cyber actions against it. Activities such as the identification and remediation of vulnerable access points that are exploited by an adversary might be a temporary strategy of denying access. However, these are insufficient to shift behaviour and stop adversaries from looking for other access points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Western and non-Western governments have reportedly engaged in pre-positioning activities. Although pre-positioning is low impact when strictly assessed against its actual disruption and destruction of data or networks, its broader implications for research and policy warrant attention. First, when done at scale or in highly critical sectors – for example, in the cases of Volt and Salt Typhoon in their activities in the US – pre-positioning signals an actor’s presence once discovered. The demonstration of an adversary’s capabilities has potential psychological effects on the targeted country. Sustained performance of pre-positioning might create and consolidate heightened perceptions of uncertainty over the vulnerability of networks. Second, public communication strategies to condemn actions perpetrated by adversaries have limited and potentially contradictory effects. On the one hand, public condemnation shows discontent and unacceptability of conduct that can serve as justification for retaliation. On the other, public shaming may have immediate adverse effects and further embolden an adversary, especially as such activities are seen only as “unacceptable” but are not deemed illegal under international law (although they may be under domestic law). Even so, the short-term morale boost might be an acceptable trade-off for the targeted state if growing collective displeasure with pre-positioning helps draw a more credible red line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the other end of the spectrum is a high-impact case – a “severe catastrophic attack” – where a cyberattack results in massive kinetic impact: economic disruption and/or a high number of casualties, with direct threats to national security. It should be emphasised that, as a rule of thumb, it seems unlikely that cyberattacks would have the same impact as catastrophic kinetic equivalents – at least so far. Even where large-scale cyber disruption has impacted critical societal systems, it should be possible to remedy (although not necessarily immediately). There is significant variability in the scale, impact and nature of an incident that meets the Category 1 designation. An impacted state may treat a cyber breach that is equivalent to a conventional strike as either above or below the threshold, depending on the specifics of the breach and its wider context. It is therefore possible to envisage an incident that is so severe – for instance, with irrefutable threat to life – that a government may choose, or feel compelled, to treat it as an above-threshold incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between the two poles are medium-impact cases. This is a space of persistent, sub-threshold cyber activity with ambiguous impacts and attribution. Here, the potential for reinvigorating cyber deterrence is most acute. Rather than plan for extreme scenarios “in the waiting”, states must develop adaptive deterrence strategies for this middle ground, where the balance of ambiguity, signalling and tailored countermeasures might be more effective in shaping adversary behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/119c8ks.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: Spectrum of Cyber Operations and Deterrent Impact&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A focus on the middle ground moves away from an unhelpful framing of the hypothetical “big event” while serving two important functions. First, operations (and their impacts) can be mapped according to their gradation of severity and objectively compared to non-cyber counterparts. Ransomware threats, for example, have seen large economic impacts, but on their own their impacts are still limited and insufficient to amount to an act of war. This leads to the second point: a “menu” of pre-emptive and reactive responses under a cumulative deterrence view can be proposed and assessed on the basis of their potential impacts and effectiveness against particular actors, their contextual dependencies and their drawbacks. In line with a cross-domain approach, the menu should include both cyber and non-cyber options. Policymakers should also consider the questions in Table 1 – these are by no means exhaustive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/8ZcF5wC.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 2: Menu of Pre-Emptive and Reactive Responses&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, as middle-ground cyber incursions are sub-threshold, “one-shot” responses (whether signalled or actioned) may be poorly aligned with the threat. Instead, cyber deterrence should rely on a “campaign”. This closely mirrors a persistent engagement approach. However, unlike that approach, it has a holistic – rather than military – focus because it includes diplomatic, economic and informational options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-recommendations-1&quot;&gt;KEY RECOMMENDATIONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this early stage of the project, the following, most pressing, recommendations have emerged. These form the foundations for a cumulative and tailored approach to deterring malicious cyber activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;frame-cyber-threats-pragmatically&quot;&gt;FRAME CYBER THREATS PRAGMATICALLY&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, policymakers and defence stakeholders should be cautious not to over-inflate the significance of a hypothetical “big event” cyber incident. Zealous curiosity about unexpected critical service outages, such as for the 2025 Spain and Portugal power cut, can feed this tendency. While there is a compelling “fiction becoming reality” pull to such narratives, they are not necessarily conducive to progressing a pragmatic approach to implementing cyber deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, policymakers might look at existing crisis response units (that is, those for natural catastrophes or “traditional” kinetic effects) across agencies to understand correlation and/or learning opportunities for cyber and non-cyber preparedness, response and communication strategies. Doing so may allow them to better position economic, social and political impacts of cyber incidents within a more proportionate framing – and thus more appropriately calibrate perceptions of impact and institutional responses to cyber incidents and their effects (intentional or not). It may also highlight opportunities to integrate cyber effects with other disruptions in the grey zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, to frame cyber threats pragmatically and calibrate deterrence measures, policymakers should consider a more targeted and contextually sensitive approach to their actions. This includes devising actor-specific deterrence strategies in addition to existing broader national and regional frameworks. This “tailored deterrence” might allow for better calibration of cultural, regional and contextual factors that are detrimental to the impact, measurement and effectiveness of deterrence. Moreover, a context-sensitive approach might lead to better calibration of the “shelf-life” or desired frequency of use of a deterrence mechanism (how much impact it can deliver and for how long). While states may already engage in tailoring – both privately and publicly – this has limited “signalling” impact if it is not disseminated on a clear and timely basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the following stages of this research project, RUSI will work to support the pragmatic framing of cyber threats, with the specific objective of mapping these to a menu of deterrence options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;work-towards-agreement-on-meaningful-red-lines-in-cyber-effects&quot;&gt;WORK TOWARDS AGREEMENT ON MEANINGFUL RED LINES IN CYBER EFFECTS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judged by their scale, catastrophic cyber incidents are (at present) unlikely to reach the threshold of armed conflict. However, if states are serious about cyber deterrence, they need to understand the relationship between two elements that are arguably decisive: political will and geostrategic context. Generally, states will not frequently signal or invoke the crossing of a threshold due to cyber actions, but political will and geostrategic context might be the most critical factors in a decision to do so. For example, Costa Rica declared for the first time a state of emergency due to a cyber incident, but never officially and publicly said Conti was affiliated with Russia. Albania, in contrast, was the first country to cut diplomatic ties (in this case with Iran) due to a cyberattack – a much more politically relevant move for signalling unacceptable behaviour in inter-state relations and highly reflective of the rising tensions between the two countries. Another example is Iran’s decision to attribute a 2019 cyberattack against one of its intelligence units to the US. The decision to attribute was part of a broader context of rising tension between the US and Iran in the Strait of Hormuz, which again shows that context and political appetite matter. However, on their own, cyber operations in a context such as this have more in common with a strategy of escalation management than deterrence. This further endorses the need to rethink the role of cyber in deterrence more generally. The pairing of cyber as an escalation-management tool with kinetic or other economic and diplomatic means of deterrence points to potential game-changing elements in deterring hybrid threats in the grey zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like-minded Western states have articulated that a cyber operation might constitute an act of war, but there is significant cultivated ambiguity on what the threshold is, and which actions would breach it. Interpretations of how international law applies to cyberspace are also growing but may still be insufficient to objectively shape customary international law. Such ambiguity is understandable, reflecting a pragmatic desire to avoid both unnecessary escalation and the tying of one’s own hands. However, this also undermines the formation of clear signalling of the degree of cyber incursion that would (or could) constitute an act of war equivalent to a conventional strike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where political and contextual appetite for strong deterrence measures is uncertain, a lack of threshold demarcation significantly diminishes options for deterrence as well as their effectiveness. Like-minded Western states should consider how they can signal red lines with greater credibility, while maintaining the operational and strategic ambiguity required to consider incursions on a case-by-case basis. The authors recognise that ambiguity may, itself, have a deterrent effect and may be a strategic necessity to maintain contextual flexibility, including the flexibility to de-escalate. However, ambiguity can also have a dampening effect on a state’s capacity to signal credibly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, policymakers and strategists in like-minded Western states should consider whether it is possible and desirable to outline which actions would constitute a threatening of the use of force by cyber means. For instance, pre-positioning in a particular critical system might, in some circumstances, constitute a threat of force and a violation of the UN Charter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;break-inertia-and-consider-all-options&quot;&gt;BREAK INERTIA AND CONSIDER ALL OPTIONS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has highlighted that there is a wide array of middle-ground cyber incursion activity that is sub-threshold. Nonetheless, such activity poses national security risks and societal harms. Policymakers and strategists should consider whether there are opportunities to signal intent and rapidly respond to incursions that currently would not receive a response or would have a delayed reaction months later. Understandably, rapid and firm reactions to middle-ground events may be difficult to coordinate quickly with allied states. Nonetheless, there may be opportunities to draw on a menu of options and take action to signal firmer red lines as part of a broader deterrence campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, it should be noted that deterrence can require threatening something at least equivalent to, but ideally greater than, the threatened or actualised incursion. At the 2025 Paris Summit of the Pall Mall Process, a member of the US National Security Council raised the possibility of lethal force against adversarial actors involved in the commercial offensive cyber industry. While the comment received consternation, lethal force is used in domestic and international operations against sub-threshold threats such as terrorism and piracy. Doubtless, a drone strike against the notorious cybercrime group Evil Corp in Russia would be logistically harder – and more hair-raising – than one against, for instance, Houthi militants in Yemen. However, consideration could be given as to when and how “big sticks” or covert action could be used to enforce deterrence, even if the provoking incursion is sub-threshold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although expert views on cyber deterrence remain divided, with some rejecting the concept entirely, this paper advocates for the adoption of cross-domain deterrence to reduce hostile state-sponsored cyber activity. It draws on diplomatic and financial toolkits, among other levers. Rather than “unrealised and unspecific scaremongering” that risk overshadowing the important shift in the threat picture – stealthier, more sophisticated and large-scale pre-positioning by some actors – ongoing policy research and dialogue should draw from and advance the practical understanding of a cyber-oriented view of cross-domain deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research findings also recognise the political appetite of major Western states to adopt more assertive measures in response to hostile activity in cyberspace. Historically, cyber activity was often linked to espionage and intelligence activities, and thus considered beyond the scope of traditional deterrence strategies. Now, given the urgency to respond to existing geopolitical threats, the push for a new European defence and security architecture and recent examples of increasing political and strategic adversary activity in cyberspace, there is a vital and time-sensitive opportunity to assess the role of cyber in contemporary deterrence strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A cross-domain approach should support the development of tailored and cumulative deterrence strategies. This approach, drawing on multiple levers in cyber and beyond, could support states in devising strategies that address specific actors – and can therefore be more carefully crafted in light of the adversary’s strategic culture as well as assessed in terms of effectiveness and implementation with specific indicators – and reflect on effectiveness or gains against the adversary over time. Doing so could then lead to like-minded governments collaborating on actor-specific deterrence frameworks and more purposefully developing joint deterrence strategies. Such strategies would include cyber-specific interventions (that is, joint attributions, takedowns and/or cyber operations to deny, degrade and disrupt an adversary’s capacity). However, in isolation, these will not be enough. Further RUSI research will assess the wider spectrum of interventions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken together, this layered strategy might help to disincentivise some sub-threshold malicious cyber activity while also laying the groundwork for more forceful responses to severe incursions. To advance this agenda, two workstreams are proposed to work towards the goal of a common framework of cyber deterrence that is accessible for policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, it would be helpful to build on the spectrum of cyber operations and impacts articulated in this paper to understand cumulative deterrence with a range of real and hypothetical case studies. Second, as this paper has highlighted, there are lessons to be shared across the multiple informal schools of thought on cyber deterrence. Stakeholders and experts with diverse perspectives on cyber deterrence need to be brought together and collaborate creatively with traditional deterrence strategists, thereby facilitating a more integrated and pragmatic framework. To this end, tailored research engagements will be used to bridge this gap – moving from the semantic and conceptual deadlock of “cyber deterrence” to operational, actor-specific deterrence fit for today’s threat environment.&lt;/p&gt;

However, the full implications and scope of the China-Russia partnership, particularly as it may pertain to Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), remain both undertheorized and underexplored.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this reason, the CSIS Americas Program designed a novel tabletop exercise to better understand the consequences of China-Russia coordination in LAC. Specifically, the exercise considered a scenario in the aftermath of a disputed election in Guatemala, where the future of the country’s relationship with Taiwan was at stake. Players from a wide cross section of think tanks, academia, and government conducted two iterations of the same exercise, one in which the China and Russia teams were not able to coordinate, and one in which they were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findings from this exercise have major implications for future U.S. policymaking. First, when given the opportunity to coordinate, China and Russia eagerly did so and were able to secure a favorable outcome to the initial crisis. However, on the subsequent game turn, the United States, which had invested in building more long-term influence within Guatemala, nevertheless secured its preferred policy outcome in both iterations of the game, including preserving Guatemala’s status as a diplomatic ally of Taiwan. This suggests that U.S. influence in LAC appears to remain sizeable, but closer China-Russia cooperation should be accorded more gravity than it currently receives in policy discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exercise made a number of assumptions about the strategic and policy preferences of China and Russia. Importantly, the second turn of the game introduced an additional dynamic of a mining concession that the United States, China, and Russia were all interested in securing. While the China team was consistently unwilling to divert resources to this objective, Russia viewed the mining concession as its primary focus across games, creating a fissure in the Beijing-Moscow partnership even when the two were able to coordinate. While the authors believe this scenario adequately models a possible future scenario, changes in Chinese or Russian interests or the sequence of events could have significant effects on the outcomes. The exercise thus is intended to underscore broad trends, not predict exact outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On October 27, 1941, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt purported to have received a secret map outlining plans by Nazi Germany to carve up the Western Hemisphere. While the authenticity of the map has been disputed, even at the time of the speech, the president’s fear of a potential German challenge within the Western Hemisphere was palpable: “This map, my friends, makes clear the Nazi design not only against South America but against the United States as well.” For the United States, blessed with the natural barriers of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, an ascendant Axis power leveraging connections to the Americas posed the only genuine territorial threat to the U.S. homeland. Indeed, concerns over adversaries successfully establishing a foothold in the Western Hemisphere figured in U.S. war-making policy in World War I as well, when the Zimmermann telegram generated furor over Berlin’s efforts to enlist Mexico in waging war on the United States’ border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time of Roosevelt’s speech in 1941, Germany was not alone in conjuring designs against the United States and its allies. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, and the subsequent declaration of war by Germany less than two months after Roosevelt’s remarks, laid to rest any doubt about the Axis’s position toward Washington. By declaring war virtually simultaneously, both Berlin and Tokyo hoped to divide and dilute U.S. industrial strength by forcing it into a two-front war in the Atlantic and the Pacific. The move was part of a series of coordinated efforts by the Axis powers of Germany, Japan, and Italy to rewrite global order in their image. Today, many scholars and policymakers believe that a new axis is forming, oriented around the growing cooperation between Putin’s Russia and Xi’s China, with important players such as Iran and North Korea joining the ranks on occasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On February 4, 2022, a mere three weeks before Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, Putin and Xi held a meeting in Moscow at which they declared a partnership that both leaders purported to be greater than a traditional alliance. In the words of the two, this would be a “no-limits partnership.” At a follow-up meeting a little over a year later, Xi told Putin: “Now there are changes that haven’t happened in 100 years. When we are together, we drive these changes.” Putin nodded in agreement. Xi’s comment was more than a parting platitude; the notion of “changes unseen in a century” has been identified by scholars as foundational to China’s view of itself as an inexorably rising power set to overtake the United States as the world undergoes unprecedented changes that will catapult China into the driver’s seat of history—and make it the progenitor of a new world order. The brief exchange is illustrative because it indicates that the China views Russia as a key partner in its mission to overtake the United States. In the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, China’s steadfast support of Russia, and the economic effects of such support amid a coordinated effort to isolate and sanction Russia, have signaled the beginning of a new era of alliance building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While China and Russia have long cooperated in pursuing similar ends, most notably by using their respective permanent seats on the UN Security Council to shield one another from international criticism and accountability efforts, Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 drastically ratcheted up cooperation between the two powers. In particular, Russia’s growing isolation from the rest of the global economy has left it dependent upon China as a financial lifeline. China, for its part, has been eager to buy up heavily discounted Russian oil and gas, previously destined for Europe, and allow tensions in eastern Europe to draw attention away from its own military provocations around Taiwan and in the South China Sea. During a vist Putin’s made to Beijing in May 2024, the two countries reaffirmed their ties with a sweeping joint communiqué, stating, “Russian-Chinese relations stand the test of rapid changes in the world, demonstrating strength and stability, and are experiencing the best period in their history.” Furthermore, during a recent diplomatic visit to multiple European countries, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs Kaja Kallas that China was unwilling to allow Russia to lose its war in Ukraine, lest the United States turn its full attention toward China in the Indo-Pacific region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alliance has also attracted a number of camp followers, most notably Iran and North Korea. Both have played a key role in Russia’s war effort against Ukraine. Iranian Shahed drones bombard Ukraine’s cities and civilian infrastructure, while North Korean artillery shells and soldiers have been shipped to the front lines to feed the voracious appetite for ammunition and manpower. While such cooperation is deeply concerning, especially from a regional stability perspective, as both Tehran and Pyongyang have demonstrated they are more than capable of generating security concerns for their neighbors, the two remain decidedly junior partners in the alliance. At present, only Beijing and Moscow have the combination of economic, diplomatic, and potentially military capabilities to challenge Washinton’s interests not just on the Eurasian landmass, but within the United States’ own shared neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If China and Russia’s “no-limits partnership” were to extend into true cooperation in LAC, both countries would already have sizeable foundations to build upon. In the short to medium term, this cooperation could have deleterious effects on U.S. economic, political, and even physical security within the Western Hemisphere. The two countries could conspire to develop preferential access to the region’s critical minerals and energy reserves or spin mutual support networks to help evade sanctions. Coordinated messaging campaigns could frustrate U.S. diplomatic efforts to shore up democracy and human rights and simultaneously lay the groundwork for expanded Chinese and Russian security footprints in the hemisphere. In the event of a crisis or conflict between the United States and Russia or China, such efforts would likely accelerate into overdrive to create a hostile operating environment for the United States close to home and defang Washington’s long-standing strategy of denying the Western Hemisphere to adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If China and Russia are coordinating, a natural starting point would be in the media and information space. While Beijing and Moscow’s abandonment of Tehran in the face of recent Israeli and U.S. airstrikes suggests that the new axis, if it exists, may not be as strong as previously thought, exerting influence in the media and information domain has relatively low barriers to entry and potentially high returns on investment. Digital media can propagate messages hundreds of thousands of times without requiring new physical infrastructure or significant capital investments. Both countries have built formidable media apparatuses in the Western Hemisphere and already cooperate either formally or informally with one another to promote media content of mutual interest. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has been illustrative of this latter form of cooperation, with China’s media presence in the region helping to amplify Moscow’s messaging that the war was provoked by NATO intransigence and U.S. imperialism and is thus defensive in nature. One report from the National Defense University traces this process of dissemination, noting how LAC journalists sympathetic to Moscow’s cause often have their articles platformed on Russian and Chinese state-affiliated media accounts like RT, Sputnik Mundo, and China Global Television Network. These “super spreaders” of Chinese and Russian propaganda are further boosted by Iranian networks like HispanTV and Venezuelan outlets like TeleSUR, which also have an interest in spreading anti-U.S. messages. Evidence also suggests that China and Russia have already cooperated on media operations in specific contexts, with a report from the International Republican Institute finding that Chinese and Russian outlets engaged in a “virtuous cycle of disinformation” in Argentina, sharing and re-sharing one another’s content to magnify desired anti-U.S. messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability of media networks to amplify one another means that coordination in this space is particularly useful, having a cumulative effect that makes disinformation or propaganda campaigns more effective the more media outlets buy into them. In the event of a conflict or crisis scenario, Chinese and Russian media in the region would likely amplify one another to flood the information space with bogus or otherwise biased content seeking to at the very least keep the majority of countries neutral—and perhaps sway some governments into backing the policy positions of Moscow or Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ascertaining whether the relationship between Beijing and Moscow represents coordination or convergence, and the practical implications of both, has major implications for the United States’ own strategy toward LAC. Especially as U.S. policymakers still largely view China and Russia as separate and distinct actors in the region, a new strategy may be needed to think about how to deal with an integrated threat from two authoritarian adversaries, as well as how and when it may be advantageous to potentially drive a wedge between Moscow and Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-tabletop-exercise&quot;&gt;The Tabletop Exercise&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To test the implications of China-Russia collaboration in LAC’s media and information environment, the CSIS research team developed a unique tabletop exercise (TTX), which was conducted over the course of two iterations and featured a total of 20 participants, representing former government officials, think tank experts, and academics. The scenario at the center of the exercise revolves around a contested election in Guatemala and the role that U.S., Chinese, Russian, and Guatemalan authorities would play in the information domain to influence their desired outcome in the crisis. Both iterations of the exercise were identical, with one exception: In the first iteration, the teams representing China and Russia were not allowed to speak to one another at any point during the exercise; in the second iteration, they were permitted (though not required) to communicate and coordinate their activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scenario begins after a theoretical narrow electoral defeat of the incumbent Semilla party in the second round of the 2027 Guatemalan presidential elections by a new pro-China party (deemed “Crecer” for the purposes of this exercise). However, numerous reports of irregularities have led the Arévalo government to push for a recount before certifying the results. The decision has drawn accusations of hypocrisy and mass protests throughout Guatemala, risking a major crisis of legitimacy for the eventual winner. The potential to flip another formal diplomatic ally of Taiwan has also drawn the attention of China, while Russia sees an opportunity to foment chaos within the United States’ neighborhood and potentially advance its position within Central America. With this context in mind, participants were divided into a total of five teams to begin, representing the governments of the United States, China, and Russia, and the incumbent and opposition parties in Guatemala.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each iteration of the exercise was played in two turns. Turn 1 followed a discussion-negotiation-adjudication framework, beginning with teams convening to review their goals and prepare strategies for their turn. The U.S., China, and Russia teams each received an activity budget (see Table 1) approximating their relative capacity to influence the media and information space in Guatemala.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/2YzV0ue.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: Activity Budgets and Rationales&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following initial discussions, the U.S., China, and Russia teams were able to send one representative to meet with each of the Guatemalan teams to share plans and negotiate outcomes. The U.S., China, and Russia teams then assembled their respective activity agendas for the end of the turn. Teams could use their activities to either support the Semilla or Crecer parties in their bid for the disputed presidency, or work to expand influence in Guatemala. Furthermore, these activities could be either overt or covert. Overt activities were revealed to the entire group at the end of the turn. Covert activities were shared only with the TTX facilitators and revealed only at the end of the exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After revealing all overt activities, both the Semilla and Crecer teams could choose to either endorse one overt activity or expose one covert activity. Endorsing an overt activity meant it counted as twice as effective for the purposes of the final score tabulation, representing the added legitimacy offered by local actors cosigning a country’s message. Exposing meant a team could force any other team to reveal one covert activity at random, simulating the ability of civil society organizations and individuals to track down media influence campaigns. Covert activities revealed this way were then negated for the purposes of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The turn concluded with a simulated dice roll, representing the still uncertain nature of the election. The dice roll began with a 50/50 chance for either Semilla or Crecer to win. Each activity in support of one party further increased that team’s odds by five points. For instance, if in total the U.S., China, and Russia teams allocated three activities in support of Semilla and five in favor of Crecer, the final odds would be 60/40 for Crecer to win. After the winner was announced, both the Semilla and Crecer teams consolidated into a single team, representing the new government of Guatemala.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second turn of the TTX took place six months into the administration of the new Guatemalan government, as it was contemplating two major policy proposals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whether to continue Guatemala’s diplomatic recognition of Taiwan or switch to the China; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whether to grant a new nickel mining concession on which U.S., Chinese, and Russian companies have all bid.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to there being two policy outcomes teams could seek to influence, the overall activity budgets of each team were adjusted based on the outcome of the previous turn. These modifications are explained below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/8Uo9Qay.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 2: Turn 2 Activity Budget Adjustments&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with the first turn, teams began with an internal discussion phase, followed by a negotiation step where the U.S., China, and Russia teams could send one representative each to meet with the unified Guatemalan government team. Rather than seeking to influence the outcome of the election or expand influence, in this turn, teams could either influence the vote on Taiwan in either direction or advance their country’s case in the vote on the mining concession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the turn, the U.S., China, and Russia teams again revealed overt activities. The Guatemala team was then able to reveal up to two covert activities, divided across one or two teams. Activities revealed this way were negated for the purposes of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unified Guatemalan government team then headed to a vote internally on both issues. Players were encouraged to envision themselves as individual members of the government who can take contrary stands based on what they have heard from the U.S., China, and Russia teams for this decision. After this vote concluded and the results were reported, the TTX facilitators revealed all activities from the U.S., China, and Russia teams and tallied their totals as additional votes, representing the power of information operations to shape the outcome of political decisionmaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After players completed both turns of the first iteration, they restarted the exercise using the same teams. The gameplay was identical, except that in the second iteration, the China and Russia teams were allowed (though not required) to coordinate their decisionmaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-findings&quot;&gt;The Findings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the two game iterations, the CSIS research team documented internal team discussions and the specific actions that these groups decided upon. The following section outlines some of the major takeaways from this analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;were-china-and-russia-likely-to-cooperate&quot;&gt;Were China and Russia Likely to Cooperate?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was notable that, when given the opportunity to collaborate in the second iteration, the China and Russia teams almost immediately began to work together. The resource restrictions that both teams faced in confronting a preponderance of U.S. influence seemed to naturally drive this partnership. In particular, during turn 1 of the second iteration, Russia and China allocated their full share of activities to supporting Crecer’s electoral bid. This proved a potent package of overt and covert activities that saw a Crecer sweep in the second iteration, compared to a narrow defeat during the first iteration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/vKEXEAG.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 3: Activity Distribution, Turn 1, Game 1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/xy9s2uc.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 4: Activity Distribution, Turn 1, Game 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, during turn 2 of the second iteration, Russia only allocated one of its activities to supporting a diplomatic switch on the part of Guatemala, with the vast majority of its activities aimed at supporting a Russian victory on the mining concession. This development reveals two especially interesting insights into the potential effect of a Russia-China alliance. First, whether Guatemala recognizes Taiwan or China is arguably of little importance to Russia, so the fact that this team was willing to allocate even one of its activities suggests that an alliance scenario could lead to some degree of authoritarian altruism between Moscow and Beijing. However, the fact that Russia’s support for this change in recognition remained limited despite fulsome dialogue with China suggests that the degree of cooperation may be limited, especially when Russian economic interests are also at stake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ucZaxaC.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 5: Activity Distribution, Turn 2, Game 1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/vmwiuGc.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 6: Activity Distribution, Turn 2, Game 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, it is important to note the way in which the behavior by members of the China and Russia teams changed when coordination became possible. In the first iteration of the TTX, both teams generally sought to persuade the Guatemalan actors through appeals to the benefits of cooperation. During the second iteration, both were more willing to resort to overtly hard-edged measures, including allusions to economic pressure against the government of Guatemala. The China team was particularly willing to engage in such threats. This change in team behavior could be seen as an indication of the increased confidence China and Russia have when they feel able to count on one another’s support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-did-the-united-states-fare&quot;&gt;How Did the United States Fare?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both iterations of the game, the United States was able to secure its preferred outcomes by the second turn. Its strategy remained unchanged: In both instances, the U.S. team elected to use its full complement of actions in step 1 to expand influence. This strategy broadly comports with stated U.S. policy of nonintervention in regional affairs, particularly in the context of a disputed election. In its conversations with the Semilla and Crecer teams, the U.S. team consistently sought to avoid the appearance of selecting either party’s claim to legitimacy and stressed measures like recounts and international electoral observation missions as an alternative means of defusing the initial crisis without placing its finger on the scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that the two-step structure of the game may have given the United States an advantage in the second turn. The TTX design deliberately left the decision on recognition of Taipei up for debate irrespective of which political party prevailed, in order to represent the complex nature of this decisionmaking. However, there was persistent debate within the government of Guatemala as to whether to move forward with the switch. Accordingly, while China and Russia were successful in influencing the outcome of the election in turn 1 of the second game, they failed to secure enough votes from the Guatemala team during turn 2 to effectively switch recognition from Taiwan to mainland China. The United States, meanwhile, was able to exploit these divisions, as well as the reluctance of the Russia team to expend more of its activities on encouraging a Guatemalan diplomatic pivot to China, to not only preserve Guatemala’s recognition of Taiwan but also secure the mining concession for a U.S. company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The introduction of China-Russia coordination, however, did force some degree of trade-offs in U.S. strategy between the first and second iterations of the game. For instance, during the first game, the United States allocated eight of its activities to preserving Guatemala’s recognition of Taiwan and four to advancing the U.S. company’s claim to the mining concession. In the second iteration, the U.S. team increased the number of actions supporting Taiwan to nine and decreased those in favor of the mine to three. In both instances, the allocation of U.S. activities seemed to reflect real-world priorities, wherein the preservation of Taipei’s diplomatic allies in the Western Hemisphere is of greater importance for Washington than the advance of any particular U.S. company’s economic interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broadly, the lessons from the U.S. team paint an optimistic picture for Washington’s ability to influence the media and information space in LAC. However, this conclusion comes with important caveats. For one, the United States has more tools at its disposal to influence Guatemala than it may have other countries in the hemisphere; Guatemala not only has an institutionalist government but remains closely tied to U.S. economic and political affairs. For instance, participants on the U.S. team brought up a review of Temporary Protected Status of Guatemalans living in the United States as both a carrot and a stick for the Guatemalan government. In a South American country such as Brazil or Ecuador, with a lower level of economic dependency on the United States, information space interventions may be of more limited efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-did-the-strategies-of-regional-teams-differ-between-games&quot;&gt;How Did the Strategies of Regional Teams Differ Between Games?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both regional teams sought to extract maximal support from international actors during the first turn of the game. Crecer was overall more willing to countenance more underhanded forms of engagement, such as receiving an electoral observation mission led by BRICS+ members (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates). Semilla, by contrast, initially sought support from the United States, but the U.S. team’s reluctance to be seen as overtly supporting a particular side in the crisis meant these efforts met with few concrete results. In the first iteration, Crecer endorsed a move by Russia supporting its claim to victory, while Semilla exposed a covert Russian action. Ultimately, and despite Russian support, Semilla secured a narrow victory in turn 1 of the first iteration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As previously noted, even when the winner of the election in the second game was Crecer, ostensibly a more China-aligned government, there was persistent division among the individual members making up the unified Guatemalan government team as to whether they should drop recognition of Taiwan in favor of the mainland. While this may represent a shortfall in the game design, as Crecer was designed to be an ostensibly pro-China political movement, the debate nevertheless reflected real concerns that countries considering such a diplomatic switch face internally. As such, the game suggests that Taiwan’s influence may be more durable than conventional assessments suggest. Indeed, while cases like Honduras’ recent switch to the China under President Xiomara Castro have raised concerns, previously states in LAC often considered changing diplomatic recognition only after careful consideration of the costs and benefits, or as one of a group of countries that switched recognition all at once to dilute the individual implications. Better U.S.-Taiwan coordination could help further insulate Taipei from China’s efforts to sway its remaining allies into its camp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also relevant was the heavy reputational penalty that the Russia team faced with the Guatemalan government across iterations, particularly in the mining sector. Despite the Russia team allocating a majority of its activities in both iterations to advancing the Russian company’s claim to the mining concession, the Guatemala team consistently preferred working with either the United States or China first. This may in part reflect the specific context of the scenario, given Russia’s involvement in recent corruption scandals in Guatemala, but it is likely still generalizable to LAC as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-did-covert-action-influence-outcomes&quot;&gt;How Did Covert Action Influence Outcomes?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The potential for teams to take covert action introduced a level of information asymmetry to the game. When teams elected to undertake covert actions, it was generally nuanced and informed in part by participants’ assessments of what their respective country would do in the scenario presented. Perhaps the most notable change between games was the behavior of the China and Russia teams between the first and second iterations of the exercise. On turn 1 of the first iteration, China employed exclusively overt measures while Russia mainly used covert activities. On turn 1 of the second iteration, Russia still largely relied on covert measures, but China pivoted as well, with just one overt activity and two covert activities. The increase in covert activities may have reflected the China team’s reduced concern that its covert behaviors would be exposed, or its belief that if they were exposed, there was a sufficient mass of activities combined with Russia’s that it would not impact the team’s overall strategy. By contrast, during turn 2, the first iteration of the game saw all teams pursue a mix of overt and covert actions. However, in the second iteration of the game, China and Russia exclusively employed overt actions. This suggests the China and Russia teams may have been more strident in their efforts to impact the policymaking calculus of Guatemala when working together, and therefore willing to employ overt persuasion and even coercion, a trend which is borne out from the individual interactions between those teams and the government of Guatemala.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;limitations-and-caveats&quot;&gt;Limitations and Caveats&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the game sought to replicate real decisionmaking logic and tack as closely as possible to a realistic scenario, it fell short in some key aspects. First, as already noted, the merging of the Semilla and Crecer teams into a single government of Guatemala between turns 1 and 2 of the game did not always align with the stated policy preferences of the parties in the briefing book. For instance, while Crecer was depicted as a more pro-business, pro-China party, when the Crecer team won the election in the second game, there was a practically even split as to whether to change diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China. While some level of internal dissent was encouraged by design to reflect disparate opinions within government, this level of contention was not necessarily expected and may have played a role in the U.S. victory in the second version of the game. This may be understood in part as a consequence of participants still being influenced by their roles in the first turn, and therefore unwilling to embody the policies of the prevailing party in the second turn. Future iterations of the exercise may be able to address this by stressing the shift in roles more clearly. Had the exercise merely dealt with a one-turn structure revolving around the winner of the election, the China-Russia alliance would have won handily by ensuring a Crecer victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another weakness was the role that covert action played. While theoretically covert actions were intended to encourage participants to consider actions that they would otherwise not want to acknowledge to other teams, some participants highlighted that it was not necessarily clear when covert action would be preferable to overt. Although this may have skewed gameplay somewhat, it did not appear to significantly influence the broader strategies teams pursued during the exercise. Additionally, the iterative nature of the game, with participants playing the base case and cooperation case one after the other, may have impacted game outcomes by allowing participants to update their strategies. Overall, these challenges did not appear to change the nature of participants’ actions beyond the bounds of realistic policymaking; nevertheless, these could be areas to improve upon in future iterations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Conclusion and Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the findings of this exercise, it is possible to discern a number of recommendations for how the United States can better engage in LAC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Widen cracks in the armor.&lt;/strong&gt; Even in the alliance scenario, cooperation between China and Russia was not unlimited. Russia lent token support to China’s efforts to sway Guatemala away from its recognition of Taiwan but was unwilling to back this at the expense of its own pursuit of the mining concession. The United States should seek to identify fault lines in the China-Russia relationship where it can force these difficult choices on prioritization to dilute the influence of both countries, especially where the United States has strong reason to suspect a divergence in strategic priorities. In the media space, this could mean spotlighting Russian participation in controversial Chinese infrastructure projects, for instance, to increase the cost of coordination for both powers. The United States, for its part, must also be able to prioritize effectively to ensure economy of efforts. If the China-Russia partnership proves to be as durable as the worst estimates assess, there may be cases where the United States will need to cede ground in some strategic sectors, only to stand firm on an even more critical issue.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t pick favorites, build influence.&lt;/strong&gt; In both iterations of the game, the United States focused its first turn on building influence in Guatemala. This decision gave the U.S. team a broader activity budget to draw upon in the second turn. Rather than focusing on backing particular parties in the region, the United States should seek to build durable influence within partner countries that can help insulate them from Chinese and Russian media offensives. While the United States has historically neglected LAC as a region, it nevertheless continues to exercise significant influence when acting in a coordinated manner. However, leveraging U.S. influence in the LAC media and information space may prove increasingly difficult with the dissolution of agencies like Voice of America and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Amid the recalibration of U.S. foreign assistance, one focus should be on strengthening in-country media ecosystems by supporting local journalists who can uncover and report on Chinese and Russian malign influence and better equipping local populations to sift through disinformation and misinformation. China has already pursued its own version of this strategy, leading media trainings that advance a model of journalism that disincentivizes criticism of political elites or investigations into the state. U.S. embassies can lead the charge in identifying local journalists and media outlets to prioritize for cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bring in allies and partners.&lt;/strong&gt; While the exercise only contemplated a limited number of actors given time and participant constraints, in a real-world scenario, various other entities would have a role in determining the outcome of comparable crises. In particular, Taiwan would likely have a vested interest in preserving one of its 12 remaining diplomatic allies. Canada and the European Union have also increased investments in countering dis- and misinformation. And despite recent headwinds, the United States still enjoys long-standing partnerships with LAC countries, with dedicated coordination channels and strong rapports between officials that run much deeper than those between China and Russia and LAC. The United States should seek to elevate the possibility of China-Russia coordination in LAC with these partners and develop a joint strategy to counteract them in the information domain.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

But simply rebuilding the programme won’t be enough for a nuclear deterrent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than a month after the Israeli and US attacks on Iran’s nuclear facilities and scientists, the full extent of the damage to the Iranian nuclear programme remains unclear. Intelligence assessments vary. Despite the Trump White House’s assertions that the military strikes “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear programme, US and even Israeli intelligence assessments are more conservative. The Pentagon and Israeli officials have estimated that the programme has been set back by up to two years; another US intelligence assessment suggests that Iran could start enriching uranium again in a matter of months. Broadly speaking, the consensus appears to be that the programme has not, in fact, been definitively destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, the exact extent of the material damage to the programme is secondary. As others have detailed, Iran does not have to reconstitute the whole of its programme to be able to produce a nuclear weapon and could, in fact, probably do so relatively quickly, should it decide to. The more important – and, arguably, more challenging – question is over the impact of the “twelve-day war” on Iran’s assessments and decision-making as to the value and feasibility of developing a credible nuclear deterrent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-drive-for-the-ultimate-deterrent&quot;&gt;The Drive for the Ultimate Deterrent&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent developments have probably reinforced incentives for Iran to pursue a nuclear weapon, which predate the recent escalation in violence. Namely, the attacks have made painfully clear the ineffectiveness of Iran’s other capabilities to deter and defend against attacks on its territory. Iran has historically relied on a strategy of “forward defence”, using proxies and allies across the Middle East to help ensure that threats to its security were kept away from Iran’s borders. Its missile capabilities were meant to serve as an additional deterrent against attack and as a recourse for dealing with threats away from Iranian territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of the Israeli degradation of both Hamas and Hizbullah and following the underwhelming performance of Iranian missiles in direct exchanges with Israel in 2024, the limitations of both aspects of Iran’s “forward defence” strategy have become clear. At the same time, the failure of Iranian air and missile defence in defending against Israeli and US attacks – during the “twelve-day war” and in earlier exchanges – have further highlighted Iran’s vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, whereas Tehran may have previously assumed that a near-threshold nuclear programme would be sufficient to deter attacks against its territory, the events that have unfolded since 13 July will have disabused Tehran of that belief. The scale of the Israeli attacks, the range of targets that were hit, and the willingness of the US to actively support Israeli military action against Iran will have reinforced the credibility and seriousness of the military threat Iran faces from its adversaries, already a problem in a regime that mixes paranoia into its desire to survive. Veiled threats – both by Israeli and US leadership – against Iran’s Supreme Leader and the regime as a whole will further aggravate threat perceptions in Iran, even if the US is now back to focussing on talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of these increasingly credible threats to Iranian security [MS1] and the regime, as well as the apparent ineffectiveness of Iran’s current deterrence strategy and capabilities, it is reasonable to assume that Iran is more incentivised than ever to pursue the ultimate deterrent and push towards a nuclear weapons capability. Much will depend on Iran’s calculations around what is now necessary to deter Israeli strikes. Iran’s thinking on this after 7 October 2023 failed to take account of Israel’s shock, seemingly assuming that the existing “rules of the game” could be sustained, and that Israel would continue to tolerate the existence of Hizballah and its missile force on its northern border. In reality, Israel not only regarded this as unacceptable, but had developed the intelligence access to make first-mover advantage really count, a feat repeated in the direct campaign against Iranian leadership, air defence and missile capabilities and stockpiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;easier-said-than-done&quot;&gt;Easier Said Than Done&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, intent to develop a nuclear deterrent is not sufficient; a would-be proliferator must also have the capability to do so. Here, of relevance is not simply the technical know-how, equipment and materials but also the organisational, doctrinal and other supporting components. A nuclear weapon is, after all, not the same as a credible nuclear deterrent. While Iran may have been – and probably still is – within relatively quick reach of the first, it is a long way from the second. Pursuing the former without securing all the components necessary for the latter would leave Iran in an exceptionally vulnerable position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, a single nuclear warhead – or even a small arsenal of nine or ten nuclear weapons (a somewhat arbitrary hypothetical, based on the amount of highly enriched uranium that remains unaccounted for following the attacks on Iran’s nuclear sites) – would not be a survivable deterrent. Such a small stockpile would be immediately targeted by Israel and, probably, the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to assess the size of the nuclear weapons arsenal that Iran would have to develop before it could be assumed to have a survivable second-strike capability. Israel is estimated to possess about 90 nuclear warheads with sufficient fissile material to produce an estimated 200 weapons, as well as superior air and missile capabilities. That is saying nothing of US nuclear and conventional counterforce capabilities. Acquiring a nuclear capability that could survive a pre-emptive Israeli or US strike – or at least create sufficient doubt in Israel and the US over their ability to eliminate an Iranian arsenal in such a strike – will not necessarily require Iran to obtain warhead parity. However, it would necessitate possession of a sizeable and distributed arsenal. Any concerted campaign to produce deliverable nuclear weapons at scale would almost certainly be picked up by Israeli or US intelligence and targeted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the challenge of successfully attaining a survivable second-strike capability, a credible Iranian nuclear deterrent would also be predicated on bolstered conventional capabilities. First and foremost, this would require the reconstitution and improvement of Iranian air and missile defences to defend against Israeli pre-emptive or retaliatory strikes in case of an escalation to a nuclear exchange. As the “twelve-day war” and, indeed, the last year have demonstrated, Iran’s air and missile defences are unable to meet the requirements of defending Iran against a concerted Israeli attack. Existing air and missile defence capabilities have been further degraded as a result of these strikes. According to Israeli estimates, the “twelve-day war” decimated about a third of Iran’s pre-war missile defence systems, although Tehran claims to have replaced damaged systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Iran currently lacks sufficient advanced conventional capabilities to give it meaningful conventional deterrence and escalation options short of resorting to nuclear weapons use in the instance that it decided to acquire a nuclear weapons capability. In the case of North Korea, before Pyongyang had sufficient conventional missile capabilities and numbers to deter a pre-emptive South Korean strike against its nascent nuclear capability, it maintained a massive conventional force giving it options for escalation. In that case, a large buildup of conventional artillery able to directly target Seoul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Iran has the most diversified and advanced missile arsenal in its region, for now its deterrent effect has been severely undermined by its relatively limited performance over the past 18 months. This is not to say it has no value: media reporting paints a picture of Israeli and US interceptor capacity being severely tested, and analysis suggests as Iran diversified its targets that smaller salvoes later on in the war had slightly higher success rates. But its current ability to pose a direct threat to Israel has been hugely curtailed, leaving other escalatory options like threatening the Strait of Hormuz (at a cost to its own exports) or attacking US and other international forces in the region. Both are high-risk options at a time of extreme vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a nuclear capability will remain ineffective so long as Iran has not devised the organisational mechanisms and doctrinal precepts to deploy it. Which part of Iran’s defence and security structure will be responsible for fielding nuclear-armed missiles? What would the decision-making process look like for authorising nuclear use? Currently, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Aerospace Force is believed to have primary responsibility over Iran’s missile forces, including the missiles in Iran’s arsenal which are believed to be nuclear-capable. This could remain the case should Iran decide to arm its missiles with nuclear payloads. Launch authority would probably rest with the Supreme Leader. However, Iran may also choose to segregate responsibility over its nuclear and conventional forces to ensure resilience in – and complicate adversarial assessments over – its nuclear firing chain. There is also the question of what role Iran would assign to its nuclear forces in its overall deterrent strategy. All these questions and more will need to be addressed before Iran is able to effectively field a nuclear deterrent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;between-a-rock-and-a-hard-place&quot;&gt;Between a Rock and a Hard Place&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, Tehran is faced with a serious dilemma in its decision-making on whether to pursue a nuclear weapons capability as a last-ditch effort to restore deterrence or to cut its losses and – at most – continue hoping that its current nuclear programme or some reconstituted version of it will be enough to prevent further aggression against it. While the incentives for Iran to develop a nuclear weapon are clear, so are the challenges. However, it is unclear to what extent Tehran appreciates these challenges and what the Iranian leadership may be desperate or delusional enough to attempt if it feels it has no other choice. Alongside the offer of diplomatic offramps, the US and E3 (the UK, Germany and France) should also be making clear to Tehran just how difficult it will be for Iran to attain a credible and effective nuclear deterrent, not just a nuclear weapon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, Tehran will need to consider whether any nuclear deterrent it is able to produce will be any more effective than Israel’s has been thus far. The latter neither prevented Hamas from attacking, nor dissuaded the Iranians in their missile assault. Although the manner and end to which Iran may employ a nuclear deterrent would probably differ from that of the Israelis, questions over the effectiveness of nuclear deterrence in regional security dynamics remain salient.&lt;/p&gt;

But what does AI leadership actually look like? An assessment should be based on a five-factor model that takes into account different areas in which countries compete for global AI leadership: 1) economic power and private sector strength, 2) innovation and thought leadership, 3) adoption, 4) regulation and governance, 5) tech diplomacy. While the United States and China dominate through economic scale and infrastructure investments requiring hundreds of billions in funding, smaller economies, such as Japan, can establish meaningful AI leadership positions by leveraging alternative strengths. Innovation can occur through smaller, specialised models rather than only large-scale developments. Successful adoption and integration of AI technologies, effective governance frameworks balancing innovation with risk management, and strategic tech diplomacy all contribute to AI leadership.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countries across the globe are seeking to secure the benefits from artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to their national advantage. Whether in form of greater efficiency for public services, compensating for skills shortages, enhancing profits for the private sector or ensuring technological advantage for their defence sector, the race for being at the forefront of this technology and the benefits it promises is on. China and the United States, in particular, are deeply engaged in a competition to establish global leadership in AI technologies. But what defines AI leadership, and how can a country achieve it? This paper explores what variables make an AI leader by proposing a five-factor model that sets out which areas of performance are key to secure AI leadership: 1) economic power and private sector strength; 2) innovation and thought leadership; 3) adoption; 4) regulation and governance; 5) tech diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The factors at times overlap and are not all of equal importance. The sheer economic power of the United States or China, for example, will be more decisive in establishing AI leadership than Denmark’s tech diplomacy efforts, no matter how skilfully these are pursuit. But it also illustrates that economic might is not the only decisive factor and that other countries, especially those with smaller economies and without a private sector that can compete with the scale of that in the United States or China, can still carve out meaningful areas of strength that are critical in the race for AI leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;factor-1-economic-power-and-private-sector-strength&quot;&gt;Factor 1: Economic power and private sector strength&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A countries economic power and the strengths of the private sector are critical to establish a leading role for AI technologies. The United States is often considered world-leading in AI technologies, largely due to its leading technology companies like OpenAI, Nvidia, Google DeepMind or Palantir, but also other tech giants like IBM and Microsoft. Similarly, China hosts a number of large tech companies like Alibaba that have firmly established themselves in the AI market. An economic market of sufficient scale to provide growth opportunities for tech companies is key. As is sufficient venture capital to scale up strong AI start ups – something that small tech-powerhouses such as Estonia or even larger economies such as the United Kingdom, Germany or Japan struggle with. Even where their existing strengths in academic and early-stage research puts them in a strong position, the ability to scale start ups up often heavily relies on US or other foreign funding. This poses the risk that companies move out of these smaller countries which thereby lose the opportunity to retain sovereign capabilities. DeepMind, a UK start up acquired by the US tech giant Google, is a prime example of this dilemma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the EU demonstrates that a large economic market is not the only decisive factor for AI leadership. It must be paired with a strong private sector that has the ability to attract and retain topic talent, fund cutting edge research and development and, perhaps decisively, finance the necessary infrastructure required to develop AI technologies. AI development requires both large amounts of quality data and computing power. Building data centres to store data and the compute necessary to train AI models requires significant resources – including energy and financial power but also access to the right underlying technologies. Compute is highly dependent on the availability to cutting edge semiconductors, traded through a complex global supply chain featuring multiple bottlenecks – most famously the chip manufacturer TSCM in Taiwan and the Dutch company ASML, which holds the monopoly in the production of extreme ultraviolet lithography machines used to produce the most advanced chips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 500 billion US dollar budget of the US-led Stargate project, led by the US company OpenAI and meant to make the United States “a global AI leader”, illustrates the dimensions of investment at stake when it comes to building cutting edge AI infrastructure. Similarly, US companies like AWS, Microsoft and IBM are investing heavily in data centres, including in the Middle East. Despite global collaborations such as under Stargate, US companies remain at the forefront of these initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has also been investing in large infrastructure projects tailored for the development of AI. It has been successful in leveraging its government structures to turn economic might to strategic projects, providing leadership and significant resources to strategically position its technology sector. Some have described Chinese efforts to build infrastructure and data centres as “a chaotic building boom”, pointing to inexperienced local governments and companies jumping on the AI hype but struggling to keep data centres afloat. Still, the availability of large data sets and cheap energy have been seen as China’s advantages, while the lack of access to cutting edge semiconductors has often been named as the reason the United States retains an advantage over Chinese AI developments. Chinese private sector with companies such as Alibaba and Tencent have also massively invested in AI infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite differences in government and market systems, both Chinese and American AI leadership ambitions are rooted in their strong economic positions with which other countries cannot compete. Currently hosting about three quarters of AI supercomputer performance, the United States’ strong infrastructure comfortably secures it the world-leading position under this factor. With China in second place, traditional computing powers like Japan, Germany and France are under pressure, arguably now playing “marginal roles in the AI supercomputing landscape”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;factor-2-innovation-and-thought-leadership&quot;&gt;Factor 2: Innovation and thought leadership&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The launch in early 2025 of DeepSeek, the Chinese answer to OpenAI’s ChatGPT, caused a wave of panic among Western AI enthusiasts. Was this a high-performance AI model, trained for a fraction of the estimated cost to train ChatGPT-4o and on less computational power, proof that China was overtaking the United States in AI competition? Moreover, as the model was built without access to the latest semiconductor chips, does that mean US export controls are failing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been disagreement as to how truly “innovative” DeepSeek is. It became evident that the chips it was built on were sourced before the introduction of export controls and that the model is trained on OpenAI’s models. Some described DeepSeek’s models as “impressive” as “they do the same for less”, while not providing a “step change in capability”. Yet the US market’s plunge after its publication caused considerable concern. While some commentators found that US export controls “fuelled innovation” within China due to limited access to chips and that DeepSeek’s cheap and quick development is a “win for innovation”, others see it as a reminder that access to chips remains a severe restriction to genuine AI innovation in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether or not DeepSeek was truly “innovative” certainly depends on one’s definition of innovation. At the very least, it was a strong signal that beyond these large models that require enormous infrastructure in the form of data and compute that are really only accessible in the United States, innovation can also take place through smaller models. DeepSeek, if anything, was a cautionary tale to not exclusively focus on the outputs of large-scale infrastructure projects as innovation can materialise in different forms and applications. Depending on adoption and societal impact, it is certainly feasible that other countries may advance innovation and thought leadership in AI technologies, for example for niche applications or by lowering production costs. As it stands, however, the United States remains world leading in terms of AI innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;factor-3-adoption&quot;&gt;Factor 3: Adoption&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the discussion on AI leadership circulates around the development of cutting-edge capabilities, either for national security and defence purposes or those of wider public appeal, such as AI generated images. What this discussion often overlooks is that these capabilities often only represent the tip of the iceberg. And while it is highly relevant to states to maintain the technological edge in a national security context, skilled adoption of AI technologies and wider integration is critical to harness benefits on a societal level, including for economic purposes. Rolling out AI technologies in the energy or transport sector promises greater efficiency and better public services. But the technology behind these applications does not necessarily have to be cutting edge. Instead, it is the AI-human teaming, a skilled workforce that is empowered to make the most out of the technologies in a timely fashion, successful risk management, and the ability to identify existing processes that benefit from new technology enabled opportunities that make for an impactful adoption strategy. Sometimes, there is an overemphasis on AI technologies where a digitalisation process is not even concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roll out and adoption is by no means restricted to large economies like the United States or China. The United States, for example, seems more concerned about developing frontier capabilities than facilitating wider roll out. China, instead, focuses on application areas such as smart cities or robotics for its manufacturing sector. Smaller countries may prove to be more agile or better placed to technology adoption, for example because of their societal attitude to technology pick up or because of an already digital society that provides quality data. Estonia, a highly digitalised nation, could become leading in AI adoption for public services given its public sector services are already highly digitalised. Finally, AI assurance through regulation, testing and rigorous safety requirements may provide the public with greater confidence to adopt these technologies. The United Kingdom is an example of a middle-power leading on AI safety work. Adoption alone, however, means a country remains a consumer of AI technologies, not a developer or innovator, and as such cannot manifest leadership on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;factor-4-regulation-and-ai-governance&quot;&gt;Factor 4: Regulation and AI governance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governance of AI technologies remains a highly relevant issue. While the EU tries to clarify its comprehensive regulatory framework, the EU AI Act, the United States exercises pressure on the EU to abandon the voluntary code of practice preceding the full act. The United States has made clear that the Trump Administration holds on to a light touch approach to regulating its tech sector – even if at odds with allies’ concerns over AI safety and security. Meanwhile, many other countries such as the United Kingdom are still figuring out how to strike the right balance between innovation friendliness and risk management. Initially, the British approach advanced five voluntary principles for regulation, but the government led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced that it was pursuing binding regulation for frontier AI models. What this entails exactly is still to be seen. Similarly, Japan is currently committed to voluntary principles with emphasis on sectoral regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although many countries are still facing the same questions around getting this balance of regulation right and the EU is often seen as a leader in AI regulation, there remains a gap in international best practice for technology regulation that also allows for innovation. Getting this balance right is a powerful way in which other countries can mark their spot in the AI leadership race, for example by providing regulatory stability and attracting AI innovators to their jurisdiction. In the absence of US leadership on global AI governance, China has recommended a global AI governance body, illustrating that AI governance remains a factor where countries want to be seen as leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;factor-5-tech-diplomacy&quot;&gt;Factor 5: Tech diplomacy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final factor in AI leadership is international tech diplomacy, an effective tool to forge international alliances and advance soft power. The “America first” approach championed by the second Trump Administration, however, does not emphasise international tech diplomacy as a key priority. Instead, the Trump Administration’s AI Action Plan arguably “seeks customers, not partners”. China, by contrast, has long been a successful tech diplomat, particularly with respect to telecommunications infrastructure in the global south and in tech standard setting bodies such as the International Telecommunication Union, and is continuing its diplomatic engagements backed by its manufacturing capabilities providing access to cheap infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the United Kingdom and the EU have also positioned themselves as AI and broader tech diplomats. But while the United Kingdom-led AI safety summit in November 2023 was a success in putting London and AI safety on the international agenda, the legacy of the AI safety – and later security – summits are unclear. The 2025 Paris summit, for example, was not a beacon of hope for tech diplomats but instead, a sobering event demonstrating how difficult it is to find consensus among key AI powers. The fact that the United Kingdom and the United States did not sign the Paris summit declaration was seen as a strong concession from the British government to keep the Trump Administration happy at the early days of the new administration and leaves open questions as to the future of the AI Summits. Similarly, the voluntary nature of the principles suggested under Japanese leadership face significant challenges. Without binding commitments, they are fragile to bow down to (perceived) economic and national pressures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This illustrates how fragile tech diplomacy is as a pillar of AI leadership: it ultimately remains subject to external pressures. As such, tech diplomacy can enhance tech relations but will not be able to make a country an AI leader unless it is backed by elements of other pillars, for example Chinese economic power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI leadership has different facets and by no means is purely restricted to the development side. The suggested five factor model illustrates that while the economic power and a strong private sector remain the most important factor for AI leadership, especially as they support additional factors such as innovation and thought leadership, other factors offer opportunities for smaller and middle power countries to establish themselves among a group of AI leaders. For example, niche application areas, innovative, smaller models, the ability to adopt AI technologies at speed and on a societal level or striking the right balance in regulation between risk management and innovation friendliness can make middle ground countries develop strong positions in the race for AI leadership. While the global race for AI leadership remains one between the United States and China, smaller countries should focus on their ability to make themselves indispensable to the global supply chain and double down on existing strengths to leverage these in order to be able to offer something that the scale of China and the United States cannot provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The race for market domination in crucial issues such as artificial intelligence, 5G networks, semiconductors, and critical raw minerals is happening simultaneously and across hot spots undergoing heavy geopolitical realignment in Eurasia, Africa and South America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The surge in military consumption of traditional metals such as copper and silver for ammunition, electronic and weapon systems, or graphite and lithium used in battery production, military communications and unmanned systems, have singled out the Western hemisphere as a growing strategic playfield due to its abundance of these resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resource-rich nations seem confronted by what scholars call a “minerals trilemma” where governments need to “balance national security, economic feasibility, and sustainability”. For Latin American countries, both from the perspective of domestic defence capabilities and geopolitical relevance, minerals like lithium, graphite, copper, nickel, uranium, cobalt and rare earths elements are seen as particularly prized by the industrialised nations. The UK Ministry of Defence is actively managing supply chain resilience to protect military readiness “from the simplest firearm to F-35 fighter jets”. The US Department of Defense is adamantly investing in critical minerals projects as tension is high with Chinese competition. Beijing announced in late 2024 harsh export restrictions on dual-use technologies and barriers to trading critical minerals. “Critical mineral security is now intrinsically linked to the escalating tech trade war”, observers added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to NATO, critical minerals and rare earth elements enable high-tech weapon systems and electronic warfare and can be found in radar systems, precision-guided weapons, jet engines, lasers, night-vision goggles, and communications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil and Argentina have notable rare earth reserves. Cobalt, found in Cuba, Brazil, and small deposits in other countries, is currently used in thermal-resistant materials and power systems including high-performance alloys, batteries for military electronics, and missiles. Graphite is used in battery production, missile technology and military-grade lubricants, particularly battery anodes, lubricants for high-performance military equipment, and nuclear reactors. Mexico and Brazil have sizable graphite resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazilians are developing Latin America’s first nuclear-powered submarine (SN Álvaro Alberto), requiring uranium enrichment and high-performance alloys like niobium and nickel. Its space programme, responsible for the Alcântara Launch Centre, needs rare earths for satellite tech and guidance systems. As well, its defence exports industry around the Embraer jets require stable access to aluminium, nickel and rare earths. Brazil enjoys a favourable strategic position as it is self-sufficient in niobium and uranium. Its ambitions to reduce dependence on China for rare earth elements via domestic development have put the country in direction towards a regional leadership role in defence industrial cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The global armament industry is more frequently using nickel (of which Brazil, Cuba, and Colombia have significant production) in alloys for armour plating, jet engines and battery cathodes. Nickel and other corrosion-resistant metals provide military hardware with durability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Systems like Brazil’s MAR‑1 air-to-surface anti-radiation missile, used on AMX and F‑5 and Mirage platforms have various uses for critical minerals including rare earth elements (neodymium, praseodymium, terbium and dysprosium) for permanent magnets in guidance systems; copper and nickel‑based alloys for reliable electronics and structural resilience. Embraer planes (like the E-jets and C‑390) use titanium and an array of other metals and rare earths for engines and radar systems, with copper wiring and high-grade aluminium alloys essential in avionics and structural components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argentina operates nuclear power plants and has enrichment facilities. This supports nuclear energy and potential naval propulsion tech. Its air force and aerospace sector (INVAP) relies on rare earths and high-purity metals for radar systems and satellites. Argentina’s strength in scientific R&amp;amp;D, contrast to its limited industrial-scale extraction. While previous governments have looked to partner with Brazil and China for dual-use technology development, the current administration might be more interested in developing national lithium value chains with potential for military-tech spillovers. Argentina has major reserves in the Lithium Triangle (the resource-rich region comprised between parts of Argentina, Bolivia and Chile) and smaller deposits of rare earths in Patagonia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil and Argentina have known uranium reserves and some enrichment capacity. The defence importance of Uranium is connected to strategic deterrence (nuclear weapons), naval propulsion (submarines) and reactors for military energy needs. Anti-tank infantry armaments, like the Argentine MARA by the local company DGFM and the feral agency in charge of the development and research of technologies for the armed forces, CITEDEF, typically use copper, nickel and rare earths used in guidance electronics and rocket propellant ignition systems, and high-grade steel/nickel alloys in launcher tubes for structural integrity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chile’s heavy foreign investment from US and China in lithium and copper contrasts with a minor domestic defence industry. The country has largely put its hopes in becoming a key mineral supplier for the export market as it has no nuclear program, but its heavily involved in space and slowly but steadily in acquiring unmanned systems. Its focus on resource diplomacy more than military-industrial development follows a long-standing record of copper (world’s largest producer) and new plans to develop its indigenous lithium sector (second-largest global producer).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Systems for air defence, like Chile’s NASAMS, contain rare earth elements for radar electronics, phased-array components and magnetics. Chile’s air-defence like the Mistral type and M‑163/M‑167 anti-aircraft guns frequently have rare earths and cobalt in guidance electronics and magnetic sensors; and copper and nickel alloys in fire-control electronics and launcher structures. The state-owned company FAMAE produces firearms like the CT‑30 carbine, SAF submachine gun, FD‑200 sniper rifle, and rocket launchers which can frequently use copper and nickel alloys in precision barrels and firing mechanisms, and lithium and graphite in advanced multiple launch guidance modules and warhead electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Peru’s defence industry is limited, making the country act more as a resource provider. Foreign companies, especially China and the United States are heavily involved in extraction practices which make Peru a heavy competitor with other poles of regional value chains, for example, in Brazil and Chile. But given its large copper reserves (second-largest Latin American producer), lithium (emerging deposits less developed) and rare earths (small but untapped potential in Andean regions), it can turn around the country’s in-house offer for the global defence market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peruvian armament including Russian-made Mi‑24 use titanium in their armour, and the currently in-construction vessels for the Navy by Hyundai Heavy Industries will have cobalt and manganese used in wiring, communications and sensors across all systems, with nickel, cobalt and rare earths required in missile systems, armaments, engine turbines and electronics. Lithium-ion battery technology capabilities will be offered in the Hyundai package for submarine replacement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strategic-alignment-or-neutrality&quot;&gt;Strategic Alignment or Neutrality?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is Brazil’s top trading partner and major investor in rare earths, lithium and infrastructure. The US on the other hand supports Brazil’s defence industry via partnerships with Embraer and Amazon surveillance, among others, but is wary of Chinese access to dual-use minerals and strategic ports like in Rio Grande do Sul. Brazil’s nuclear submarine relies on uranium and high strength alloys and faces export control sensitivities with both the US and China watching. The country’s niobium reserves (90% of global supply) are strategically vital to US and NATO aerospace/defence firms. Washington could encouraged Brazil to “de-risk” rare earth supply chains from China, but Brazil is balancing carefully. Its semi-alignment with both superpowers means that Embraer military exports (for example, the KC-390) may be affected by supply chain nationalism or export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argentina’s geopolitical pressure points are growing. China is investing heavily in lithium projects and nuclear power plants. But under President Javier Milei’s the US is trying to reassert influence, including through IMF negotiations and lithium partnerships with US firms. The country’s lithium triangle position puts it in the middle of US-China battery war, potentially affecting tech for military purposes. China recently offered JF-17 fighter jets and military modernisation packages, which included systems needing rare earths, lithium and advanced alloys, but Argentina decided instead for the American-approved deal of acquiring F-16 jets from Denmark. Still, Argentina’s access to Western defence tech could be limited if in the future it deepens security cooperation with China. Lithium control is a key battleground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Chile is a global lithium heavyweight and copper superpower. China is a top buyer, but the US is increasing pressure to build a lithium supply chain away from Chinese processing, offering Chilean lithium a US tax break in 2024. Although Chile is not a major arms producer, the US may use its lithium leverage to influence foreign policy alignment, including military purchases. Chile uses US and European defence systems like the Leopard 2 battle tank, F-16 jet fighters and naval capabilities with technologies dependant on critical minerals which could create dependencies on Chile’s own exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China dominates Peru’s mining sector, especially copper through companies such as MMG and Chinalco. The US is wary of Chinese control of Peruvian ports, railways and rare mineral extraction. But the news on naval modernisation with Hyundai eased US concern over military technology entanglement between Peru and China. Many of Beijing’s weapons systems require copper, cobalt and rare earths, which can be mined in Peru but exported mostly to China for processing, locking Peru into China’s tech loop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;facing-the-minerals-trilemma&quot;&gt;Facing the “Minerals Trilemma”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If South American countries were to tilt too heavily towards China, Washington could enact economic sanctions or impose new tariffs targeting Chinese-origin defence systems, dual-use technologies, and related firms operating in Latin America. That could include restrictions on interoperability, software integration and sensitive mineral supply chains. But countries are already engineering their bilateral relations with Washington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For countries processing lithium, it may make more sense to push for regional processing hubs not tied to China, and convincingly ensure military platforms stay 100% Western-interoperable. Copper exports might be targeted indirectly via dual-use restrictions, and military-to-military training or intel-sharing with US could be scaled back. In the short term, Brazil’s defence sector should keep leaning toward US and European systems avoiding deep Chinese defence entanglement. Argentina is eager on continuing US tech-transfer opportunities and Chile’s close relationship with the US military might need to be counterbalanced against the country choosing mineral export alignment with Beijing (which could potentially ban Chilean lithium processed in China from entering US defence supply chains).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will South American nations create a more resilient industrial base, avoiding tech leakage to Chinese-linked firms? Can they become a trusted supplier of critical minerals to NATO countries? Can they scape being caught between top US weapons platforms and Chinese mineral dependence? Will it be space to de-risk by negotiating with more European counterparts? South American military and civilian decisionmakers need to respond to the “minerals trilemma”, a decisive cornerstone of today’s strategic sovereignty, faster than the rest of the world moves towards their market control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2025, a ministerial delegation travelled to Japan for the “Economic 2+2”, a meeting of the trade and foreign ministers for the UK and Japan, heralded by this Government as an opportunity to propel growth and resilience. In a rather au-milieu way, UK policy identifies the Indo-Pacific as critical to the economy and security, with the UK-Japan relationship described as an enhanced global strategic partnership. To what extent is this fully reflective of the Japanese experience of their security relationship with the UK?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Signalling their perceived severity of the security environment, previous PM Kishida warned that “Ukraine today may be East Asia tomorrow”. Japan now dynamically balances its peace-loving approach with a hard realism that bolsters deterrence with hard power and alliances. The Hiroshima Accord is evidence of, at least, Japan’s clear intention to increase the quality and depth of its deterrence partnerships. This article considers whether the state of the UK’s entanglement with Japan is actually a vivid collection of co-dependencies that, with some small imagination of the Japanese and US policymaker, sufficiently meet the conditions of being in an Alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stocktaking-the-uk-japan-relationship&quot;&gt;Stocktaking the UK-Japan Relationship&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A shared UK-Japan world view towards securitisation of economies and geopolitics drove the 2+2 to focus on AI, defence investment and joint research. Joining the collection of joint programmes is GCAP, the UK-Japan-Italy 6th-generation fighter programme, which from a political perspective has cemented the convergence of national-strategic goals with a programme that supports national prosperity and defence-industrial sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These fundamentals did not happen overnight. The race to partner with the Indo-Pacific centres of economic and technological gravity is a sport for many western nations, yet the UK has comparatively outstripped its competitors in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/8D4U4L5.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Comparative Progress on Defence Agreements with Japan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible that an enemy or ally could create an impression of a UK-Japan entanglement from this collection of agreements and quasi-alliances. Both the full-spectrum cyber-partnership and GCAP contain obligations arising from co-dependencies. The commitment to maintain a high technology partnership needs to account for the interactive nature of the threat, where a responsive defence-industrial feedback-loop maintains the asymmetric advantage. GCAP’s Convention requires reciprocal access to information and industrial-led spiral development. An aggregate impression could be that these agreements pass the test for the definition of an alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-meaning-of-an-alliance&quot;&gt;The Meaning of an Alliance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan has seen its relationship with the US generate defensive securitisation. As part of their shield-role, Japan is obligated to anchor the island chains, with an emphasis on survivability. The UK’s span of collaboration is already providing Japan with its survivability edge and to assist with holding China at range, albeit that scenarios for Chinese precursor operations to a Taiwan invasion include the writing down of Japanese military installations and US bases. This means that the UK must be clear on the defence obligations with Japan, based upon a revised understanding of what it means to be in an alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/DhwSFWt.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Contemporary Security Arrangements&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its review of the relevant security agreements, this article finds that mutual security clauses are not common. Where they do exist, the agreement text contains profound ambiguity on what is actually obligated in the event of a security violation. NATO’s Article V has a habituated understanding of an automatic clause to mobilise military force, yet there are not any details on the assistance that is perceived as necessary:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“…if such an armed attack occurs, each of them . . . will assist the Party . . . attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More explicitly, Article 3 of the Russia-DPRK Alliance states the need “for consultations in order to coordinate positions”, whilst within the US-Japan Treaty of Alliance each party “declares that it would act to meet the common danger”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such broad interpretations of security guarantees may burden an ally with concern about the appetite of the guarantor to take risk on its interests, yet the ally does enjoy the signalling of an increased security intention. Moreover, the vagueness within treaty obligations keeps adversaries in the dark, creating ambiguity over the circumstances in which a treaty would be enacted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1902 Anglo-Japanese Alliance is an example, well-recalled by the Japanese, where a mutual security clause was not a foundational element. The UK used de-escalatory interventions, based upon the isolation of Russia and the deterrence of France, that obviated the need to deploy forces. Similarly, a new Treaty of Alliance elect for aterritorial deterrence. Rather than deploy hard power, the focus should be on resilience to withstand and endure attack. Domains such as cyber and space exist in the aterritorial global common. National resilience may start in these realms and remain as interactive as physical conflict. This approach to an Alliance - domain hardening - is clearly within the broad yet ambiguous explications of Treaties and Alliances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article further find finds that formal alliances invariably include the US, particularly in Asia-Pacific. This means that a UK-Japan Treaty of Alliance would need careful perception management; the US agreement with Japan does not mean its unilateral protection by the US, and Japan’s many agreements show that the US tolerates Japanese bilateralism. However, neither the UK nor Japan would wish the US to take exception to a Treaty of Alliance that builds further deterrence, increases Japanese security sovereignty and infers overreach of the UK and Japan into a US prerogative for techno-military dominance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;weighing-the-costs-and-benefits&quot;&gt;Weighing the Costs and Benefits&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US-Japan Alliance will continue to be the superior hard-power relationship, providing essential extended deterrence and security cooperation. However, the UK is on a pathway that pushes the Japan relationship into a territory of security co-dependency that was once the preserve of the US. Moreover, both the UK and Japan are thinking the unthinkable about the reliability of US hard power security guarantees, with Japan perhaps seeing in the Afghanistan withdrawal a measure of peril in the US’ abandonment of an ally. Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine shows that deterrence has new dimensions beyond hard-power guarantees, where a complex and interactive system prioritises the spiral development of high-end, widely dispersed, low-cost technogy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such factors point to possible objectives for a UK-Japan Treaty. Japan’s global leadership in super-computing, AI and machine-learning would secure asymmetric survivability in cross-domain capabilities such as electronic warfare. Collaboration on advanced autonomous systems would compensate for numerical gaps in hard-power, backed-up by enhanced, bi-lateral intelligence-sharing. Not least, Japan is a credible space power, with independent vertical launch capabilities, whilst both the UK and Japan have mature Space Domain Operations, all of which are vital to respond to emerging national resilience threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This focus on the digital frontline binds the UK and Japan as deterrence-twins with an aim for asymmetric advantage over not just foes but also allies. This could present a challenge to fragile US-primacy within the Indo-Pacific and key domains. China would also see a threat to its interests in such a Treaty, although arguably this ground has already been broken by AUKUS and a newly assertive Japan, openly squaring-up to China with increased defence spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-way-ahead&quot;&gt;A Way Ahead&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to guard against US misperception, specifically of UK overreach, the US must be involved in the drafting of a UK-Japan Treaty. This would set the boundaries for twin-deterrence and enhance collective messaging towards China. The aggregate impact of UK-Japan agreements and programmes is arguably already an alliance, just not the kind that the UK has experienced in the Indo-Pacific for over a century. Importantly, the UK is – for once – leading this race, where a collection of partnerships has moved beyond what is currently agreed by Japan with any other state, perhaps including the US. The cost of losing US confidence in either the UK’s intentions or Japan’s primary security relationship is untenable to both, which is why a UK-Japan Treaty of Alliance would be a bold, but much needed, step.&lt;/p&gt;

This shift marks a deliberate strategy to overwhelm Ukraine through volume, persistence, and psychological pressure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia has normalized massive, mixed drone‑missile salvos: The average wave size has risen from about 100 munitions in 2022 to nearly 300 in 2025, while intervals between major strikes have compressed from roughly a month to as few as two days.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The salvo campaign now leans heavily on Shahed swarms to saturate Ukraine’s air defenses in line with the increasing Russian low-cost drone manufacturing capability. These salvos reflect an attritional punishment strategy—victory through volume, persistence, and psychological strain.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ukraine must counter with layered, cost‑efficient defenses: rapidly field high‑energy lasers and HPMs, expand cross‑domain early‑warning networks, diversify low‑cost interceptors and rapid‑fire guns, and fuse civil‑military tracking to decode salvo patterns in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the night of July 9, 2025, Russia launched the largest combined drone and missile attack of the Russia-Ukraine war, saturating Ukraine’s defenses with 728 kamikaze drones and 13 missiles, most aimed at Kyiv. The scale was staggering. And it was not an isolated incident. In the days that followed, two more salvos hit Ukraine—416 weapons in one wave, 625 in another—each exceeding the daily averages seen in prior months. These attacks were more than mere upticks in Russian activity. They demarcate a deeper, deliberate shift in operational tempo and a signal to Ukraine and its backers: Russia is prepared to escalate, overwhelm, and exhaust Ukraine. Massed salvo attacks are part of Russia’s evolving coercive punishment campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hlcG6ij.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Interval Between Salvos Over the Course of the War&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was once the exception has become routine. Large-scale salvo attacks now make up roughly 10 percent of all Russian aerial operations (see Appendix Table A-1). Since September 2022, the CSIS Futures Lab has tracked 157 of these coordinated waves—combinations of missiles, drones, and ballistic projectiles—deliberately sequenced to test and stress Ukrainian defenses. Early in the conflict, salvos averaged around 100 weapons per wave. By 2025, that number has tripled to nearly 300, reflecting not only expanded production but an increasingly aggressive aerial campaign. The pace has accelerated as well. In 2022, Russia launched a major strike roughly once a month. By mid-2025, the gap between salvos has shrunk to just eight days (see Figure 1). What were once peak events are now baseline activity in a campaign defined by sustained pressure and operational tempo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tempo keeps climbing. In the past two months, the shortest interval between major salvos has dropped to just two days. What were once outlier events—occasional spikes in intensity—have become standing features of Russia’s aerial campaign. Each wave piles pressure on Ukraine’s air defenses, saturating systems already strained by months of attritional combat and forcing difficult choices about what to protect. This pattern reveals more than tactical adaptation—it reflects a shift in operational logic, a move from sporadic devastation to sustained saturation. It is a strategy designed to erode, overwhelm, and exhaust, and is a central feature of the current phase of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brief first examines the evolving logic of Russia’s missile and drone salvos, showing how shifts in composition and frequency are designed to strain Ukraine’s air defense architecture. It then outlines the operational and psychological consequences of this strategy, particularly the rise of Shahed drone swarms as a primary tool of attritional warfare. Finally, it identifies a set of policy responses for Ukraine and its partners. These include (1) accelerating the deployment of directed-energy weapons such as lasers and high-powered microwaves, (2) expanding early-warning sensor networks across domains, (3) diversifying the interceptor mix to include low-cost, rapid-response systems, and (4) integrating civil and military tracking capabilities to decode Russian salvo patterns in real time. Together, these steps can help Ukraine blunt the effectiveness of Russia’s evolving aerial campaign and restore strategic balance to the skies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russias-salvos-have-different-logic&quot;&gt;Russia’s Salvos Have Different Logic&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysis of the composition of these salvos reveals a clear operational logic. It is not just about volume. It is about the mix. By integrating a greater mix of high‑end cruise missiles alongside drones and ballistic threats, Russia amplifies the strain on Ukraine’s layered defenses. Rather than sending weapons in discrete categories—drones in one wave, cruise missiles in another—Moscow blends them together. Mixed salvos stretch Ukraine’s defenses, forcing commanders to divide limited interceptors across multiple types of threats at once. The result is saturation. The more simultaneous angles of attack, the greater the chance something gets through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Russia’s large-scale strikes increasingly lean on long-range cruise missiles—specifically the Kh‑101 and Kh‑555—as well as ballistic missiles including the Iskander. These systems feature prominently in high-intensity salvos, while lower-intensity days are more reliant on unmanned combat aerial vehicles. The choice is not random. Cruise missiles offer range, low observability, and the psychological punch of a deep strike. Russian planners appear to be selecting these weapons deliberately to penetrate Ukraine’s increasingly sophisticated air defenses and to create uncertainty about where the next blow will land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time, that constant pressure does not just burn through munitions—it eats away at morale. This is the core of Russia’s salvo strategy: not overwhelming strength at a single point, but cumulative pressure across many, designed to wear down defenses through volume, variety, and repetition. In sum, the distinctive logic of Russia’s salvo launches lies in their calibrated blend of quality and quantity—an approach designed to erode air defenses through multi‑vector pressure (see Figure 2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/nLquNNC.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-russia-leans-on-kamikaze-drones&quot;&gt;How Russia Leans on Kamikaze Drones&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since September 2024, Russia’s aerial campaign has entered a new phase—one defined not by cruise missiles or ballistic strikes, but by swarms of Geran‑2 (Shahed) kamikaze drones. Where earlier salvos blended missiles and unmanned systems, the new pattern is almost entirely drone-centric. Monthly Shahed launches now routinely exceed 5,000 of these drones, with weekly averages pushing past 1,000. On the night of July 2, 2025, Russia launched 750 drones in a single wave. This is a shift in logic as well as a shift in payload. Drones are cheap, abundant, and effective at forcing Ukraine to defend in multiple locations and risk burning through its limited supply of expensive interceptors. Compared to the mixed salvos that defined earlier stages of the war, today’s drone-dominant strikes blur the line between routine and massed. Even low-intensity days now resemble full-scale assaults. One-way attack drone warfare has become the backbone of Russia’s pressure strategy: relentless, low-cost, and part of a broader punishment campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, Shahed drone launches are getting more effective. Earlier in the war, hit rates hovered below 10 percent. Now, they have nearly doubled to 20 percent. This improvement does not reflect a collapse in Ukraine’s air defenses, but rather Russian adaptation. Newer swarming tactics—overlapping flight paths and staggered timing—force defenders to divide their attention and burn through interceptors faster. At the same time, Russia has begun flying upgraded Shahed variants at higher altitudes, exploiting radar gaps and pushing the limits of short-range air defense systems. The result is compounding pressure. As the waves of drones increase in size and tempo, Ukraine’s defenses saturate faster and stocks of interceptors grow thinner. More drones slip through—not because Ukraine cannot defend itself, but because it is being asked to do so against an adversary learning in real time how to overwhelm the shield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jvppEdu.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 3: Shahed Drone Neutralization on Salvo Days&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-this-means-for-ukraine&quot;&gt;What This Means for Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The normalization of large‐scale salvo launches, driven primarily by one-way attack drones, embodies a deeper strategic logic in Russia’s wartime conduct. Oftentimes, Russia’s strategic advantage lies in its capacity to absorb losses and keep the military momentum. Historically, Russia has waged conflicts that are protracted, unbounded by strict timetables, and resilient to attrition. In each instance, Moscow relied on the capacity to outlast adversaries through sustained production and relentless pressure. Today, by massing low‑cost drones against Ukraine’s air defenses, Russia seeks to impose not only physical attrition but also psychological strain on Ukrainian society, thereby increasing domestic pressure on Kyiv’s government to concede. It is a logic of punishment and a different theory of victory than winning decisive battles along a static frontline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To keep pace, Ukraine will have to match persistence with innovation. One path forward is the rapid deployment of low-cost, high-energy laser systems capable of intercepting drone swarms before they can overwhelm conventional defenses. Unlike missiles, directed-energy weapons do not rely on expendable munitions; they can engage multiple targets quickly and repeatedly. Early battlefield testing by Ukraine and the United Kingdom suggests these systems can disable drones at standoff ranges of several kilometers. If integrated into Ukraine’s air-defense architecture, lasers could complicate Russia’s calculus—forcing a shift toward more expensive munitions or prompting investment in counter-laser technologies. Either way, they help restore cost symmetry in a fight defined increasingly by asymmetric attrition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This effort to incorporate laser systems can include using high-powered microwaves (HPMs). HPMs have the ability to target more broadly, including swarming drones. Both the United Kingdom and the United States have tested HPMs. The United States has tested these systems for both ground applications and at sea. The U.S. Army has integrated tests into its future concept for layered air defense in major exercises in the Philippines. These systems should be field tested in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond lasers, Ukraine and its international supporters must pursue a multilayered defense architecture. First, cross‑domain early‑warning sensors—combining ground radars, manned and unmanned aerial platforms, and satellite data—are vital for detecting and distinguishing simultaneous threats, from cruise missiles to drone swarms. This network can include low-cost ballons to extend range. The United States, through NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine, should find ways to fast track intelligence sharing and early-warning concepts to support Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, a diversified interceptor portfolio should pair rapid‑response, low‑cost point‑defense systems—such as radar‑guided, rapid‑fire guns and low-cost, short‑range missiles—against drones with retained stocks of high‑end surface‑to‑air missiles for cruise and ballistic threats. Ukraine has already begun deploying systems such as the Sky Sentinel, an AI-powered autonomous turret capable of detecting, locking onto, and neutralizing drones without human intervention. Funded in part through the United24, Sky Sentinel offers a scalable and cost-effective alternative to missile-based interception. In parallel, Ukrainian units are expanding their dedicated air defense and drone-interception capabilities, forming specialized UAS and FPV interceptor groups to counter the growing threat of Shahed-type drones. These domestic innovations are being bolstered by growing international partnerships. In 2025, Ukraine signed a deal with Swift Beat, a U.S. company led by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, to coproduce hundreds of thousands of drones, including interceptors, marking a significant step in public-private defense collaboration. European industry is also engaging: Denmark’s Terma, in partnership with Ukrainian drone manufacturer Odd Systems, is developing AI-powered drone interceptors, illustrating the potential of allied contributions to Ukraine’s layered defense. Together, these initiatives underscore the importance of blending bottom-up domestic innovation with direct foreign investment in Ukrainian defense manufacturing and operational capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, winning the fight in the air will take more than interceptors. It will require a fusion of technology, transparency, and analysis that draws on civil society, open-source intelligence, and classified assessments working in concert to track and decode Russia’s evolving operational art in the new missile age. Transparent, real-time tracking and attribution platforms are critical. By logging each salvo—its size, composition, and timing—Ukraine can sharpen its operational planning and synchronize its requests for international aid, ensuring that interceptor shipments align with the actual threat mix. Just as important, this visibility helps shape strategic communications, pushing back against Russian disinformation and reinforcing public confidence in Ukraine’s ability to defend itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, defense is more than stopping drones or missiles. Equally crucial is contesting the narrative. By combining directed-energy systems, layered sensors, diverse interceptors, resilient infrastructure, and real-time tracking, Ukraine can turn Russia’s salvo strategy from an overwhelming tide into a manageable, contested fight—and in doing so, regain the strategic initiative in the skies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;appendix&quot;&gt;APPENDIX&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Futures Lab defined salvos as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rolling mean number of missiles launched created for each day.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rolling window: 30 days pre-salvo.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Z-score for each day calculated based on rolling mean and standard deviation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Salvos defined as launches that exceeded the mean by at least 1.5 standard deviations, i.e., Z &amp;gt;= 1.5.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salvo compositions were weighted according to following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Day-weighted scheme:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Convert every launch day into a composition vector that sums to 100 percent, then average those vectors across days. This gives each calendar day equal influence (within category), no matter how many missiles were fired.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day-weighted scheme allows Futures Lab to normalize the data, as these salvos are launched together.&lt;/p&gt;

Twenty-six wargames illustrated the risks to China, Taiwan, Japan, and the United States that would ensue. Preparations by Taiwan are urgently needed to enhance deterrence.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The year is 2028. Xi Jinping decides, whether because of a long-held plan, internal pressures, or some provocative act by Taiwan, that China needs to apply coercive leverage against Taiwan to change the status quo. He turns to his advisers for options. There are purely economic measures, such as sanctions, but their effects are unreliable and work slowly. In the military sphere, the most dangerous course of action would be invasion: It promises a decisive resolution but risks dramatic defeat. At the other end of the spectrum, China could seize outlying Taiwanese islands, but this might simply push Taipei farther away and draw the United States into closer alignment with Taiwan.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Another alternative, which Xi ultimately decides on, is a blockade in which China attempts to stop shipping headed for Taiwan. Xi orders the China Coast Guard and People’s Armed Forces Maritime Militia to positions around Taiwan, claiming that this is an internal law enforcement matter. After China boards and seizes several ships, commercial traffic to Taiwan ceases. The action disrupts international trade and the world economy. Taiwan rejects China’s legal arguments and decides to resist. What are Taiwan’s military options? Would such a conflict escalate, and what would the military dynamics be at each point of escalation? What would happen to Taiwan’s 23 million citizens? If the United States became directly involved, what would be its military role and prospects?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A potential blockade of Taiwan burst into the U.S. consciousness in 2022 when China showed its displeasure about then–Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan by surrounding the island with missile impacts. This report uses the term “blockade” to refer to any Chinese effort using ships, submarines, and aircraft to interdict maritime traffic to Taiwan, rather than as a legal term. For more details about the legal use of the term, refer to “Legal Aspects of Blockade” in Chapter 2. This appeared to simulate a quarantine or blockade. This possibility was not a surprise to regional experts or the Taiwanese themselves, who had long been aware of this threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “joint blockade campaign” (联合封锁战役) is discussed extensively in Chinese doctrinal writing, and the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has signaled that it would consider such a campaign if it acts against Taiwan. Such a blockade would not just affect China, Taiwan, and the United States. The disruption of international trade, particularly restrictions on computer chip production, would affect every country on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this political and security environment, it would be prudent to study all forms that a Chinese blockade of Taiwan could take in order to inform the policies of Taiwan, Japan, and the United States. Yet, there has been little agreement about what such a blockade would entail, and still less quantitative analysis of possible scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report establishes a framework for understanding the range of blockade scenarios, analyzes them with a series of 26 wargames, and assesses the operational challenges that the respective parties would face in implementing and countering a blockade. The project does not argue that conflict, including a blockade, is inevitable or even necessarily likely. However, the project does argue that conflict is possible, given China’s commitment to unification, by force if necessary, and its continuing military buildup. This report, therefore, concludes by proposing policy changes to better deter a blockade and to cope with one should it occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-framework-for-understanding-a-blockade&quot;&gt;A Framework for Understanding a Blockade&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the project’s framework, all scenarios start with a common set of assumptions about the background of conflict: Tensions between the United States and China have increased, with a focus on Taiwan policy. China seeks to resolve (or at least secure major concessions on) its Taiwan problem through a blockade. It establishes an exclusion zone and declares that all ships entering the zone must first stop at Chinese ports for inspection and approval. Ships that refuse are subject to search, seizure, and attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there, scenarios diverge according to the escalation levels taken by China and the opposing coalition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has four escalation levels:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Boarding: China’s nonmilitary forces—the China Coast Guard (CCG), Maritime Security Administration (MSA), and People’s Armed Forces Maritime Militia (PAFMM)—attempt to board and seize merchant traffic to Taiwan without opening fire.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Submarines and Mines: China employs submarines and mines to interdict merchant traffic to Taiwan outside of Taiwan’s territorial waters but within the international waters of the exclusion zone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Offshore Kinetic: China employs overt force against merchant ships and escorts outside of Japan’s or Taiwan’s territorial waters but within the exclusion zone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wider War: The PLA uses overt force not only in the exclusion zone but also against Taiwan itself, the United States, and, potentially, Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan and the United States also have four escalation levels:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taiwan Constrained: Taiwan restricts its use of military force to its territorial waters and contiguous zone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taiwan Assertive: Taiwan allows its military to attack Chinese forces that have attacked or attempted to board merchant ships within the exclusion zone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;U.S. Constrained: The United States aids an assertive Taiwan with forces that engage in direct combat with the PLA within the exclusion zone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wider War: The United States attacks PLA forces outside the exclusion zone, including on the Chinese mainland.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combining the Chinese and U.S./Taiwan escalation ladders produces a matrix (Table ES.1) that describes a range of plausible scenarios ranging from a blockade using only Chinese nonmilitary forces against a constrained Taiwan to a wider war between China and a U.S.-led coalition using all conventional means at their disposal. To examine sensitivity to key variables, the project also explores some variation of assumptions within cells. Blacked-out cells were uninteresting because of the imbalance of forces. Twenty-one game iterations were played using the scenarios and variations within them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/VjYkO5F.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table ES.1: Scenario Matrix Based on Escalation Levels.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS Defense and Security Department.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These dyads, or cells in the matrix, are useful analytic snapshots, but it is unlikely that a real-world blockade would stay solely within one of them. There would be escalations and, hopefully, de-escalations. However, examining these dyads separately—without escalation or de-escalation—allows for a more complete assessment of dynamics and advantage at each level of conflict and, therefore, the military incentives for escalation that the respective commanders and political leaders might face under those circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better understand escalation dynamics, the project also conducted five free-play iterations to see how players approached the problem when there were no constraints on escalation levels. Thus, there were a total of 26 game iterations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To analyze these scenarios, the project developed models and simulations that fit into three modules, each answering a critical question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What merchant ships are available for transit to Taiwan? This module identified ships the United States and Taiwan could call upon to run the blockade and the timeline for their availability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How much cargo gets through to Taiwan? The games used three systems depending on China’s escalation level:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;ISR and Intercept modeled how many ships would get through a Chinese blockade at lower escalation levels.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Convoy Battle modeled Chinese attacks on convoys and the defense of convoys by Taiwanese, U.S., and, in some scenarios, Japanese forces.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Taiwan Operational Wargame (TOW), developed for the earlier First Battle of the Next War project, modeled the Wider War scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is the effect of cargo arrivals on Taiwan’s economy and society? This module has three elements—imports, economic outputs, and effects on Taiwanese society—and calculates these for each week of the blockade.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;project-focus-and-scope-conditions&quot;&gt;Project Focus and Scope Conditions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taiwan blockade problem is understudied, and this report is not intended to answer all questions. The analysis focuses on the operational problems faced in implementing and countering a blockade, as well as the immediate material impact on Taiwan. To provide context, the literature review section summarizes legal issues associated with blockades, the broader global economic impact that a blockade might have, and illustrative examples of historical blockades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several scope conditions also apply. China has decided on a blockade of the island of Taiwan. The project discusses but does not make conclusions about the political and legal debates that would shape the world’s reaction; rather, this project uses scenario variants to explore alternative assumptions about these debates. Taiwan resists. Conflict is limited to conventional domains, and nuclear use is excluded. Finally, there is no use of classified data to allow for the broadest possible dissemination and discussion of the report’s findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;wargame-results&quot;&gt;Wargame Results&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project ran 26 wargames. The project did not assign winners or losers; instead, the results specify (1) military losses, (2) how much materiel gets through the blockade to Taiwan, and (3) the impact of those levels of imports on Taiwan’s economy and society. Readers can weigh these results against other societal, diplomatic, and economic pressures on the respective actors to judge political outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five broad themes emerge from the wargame results:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Almost all scenarios entail casualties. Even at lower levels of escalation, casualties were in the thousands. At higher escalation levels, the United States lost hundreds of aircraft and dozens of warships. As in the invasion scenario examined in the earlier First Battle of the Next War project, the lack of air base hardening proved a critical U.S. weakness in the scenarios involving a wider war. China’s losses were also high and were often higher than those of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any blockade creates escalatory pressures that are difficult to contain. In most free-play games, despite a reluctance to escalate, teams responded to perceived escalations with minor escalations of their own and in two games spiraled to a general war. In fixed-escalation games, most dyads produced high casualties and severe economic impacts on Taiwan. There was thus significant pressure on both sides to change the rules of the game and escalate, in turn putting pressure on their opponent.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taiwan requires U.S. intervention if China uses military force in a blockade. While Taiwan’s military was capable of defeating a nonmilitary effort by China (involving the CCG, MSA, and PAFMM), it struggled against even a limited Chinese military effort. Without U.S. intervention, China’s submarines and mines destroyed 40 percent of inbound ships to Taiwan, even with a maximum effort by Taiwan’s military and U.S. resupply of munitions (as has been done for Ukraine). A “Ukraine strategy” was attractive but insufficient when applied to Taiwan because Taiwan’s needs are too great and, in most scenarios, China’s blockade was too tight. If China escalated to using military force, the United States had to accept a Taiwanese capitulation on China’s terms or become directly involved in the conflict. With U.S. intervention, in most scenarios, convoys kept Taiwan supplied, but often at a huge cost.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Energy and merchant ships are the critical shortfalls. In all scenarios, natural gas ran out in about 10 days. Taiwan has substantial inventories of coal and oil, but eventually these ran out also if not resupplied (at 7 weeks and 20 weeks, respectively). Food was not a problem because of what Taiwan produces domestically, its large inventories, and the modest shipping requirements to make up shortfalls. Rapidly acquiring ships to run the blockade was critical because regular shipping companies would not take the risk of getting involved if China begins a blockade. Airlift, submarines, and small blockade runners were inadequate substitutes for cargo ships. These alternatives could provide only a small percentage of Taiwan’s regular daily deliveries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A blockade is not a “low-cost, low-risk” option for China. Casualties were high across almost all dyads, and the incentives for escalation were always present. Two free-play games reached maximum escalation, with U.S. missiles striking the Chinese mainland and Chinese missiles striking Guam and Japan. In these and other high-escalation scenarios, the combination of U.S. bombers launching standoff missiles, submarines operating offshore, and, to a lesser extent, U.S. tactical aircraft and surface ships proved devastating against Chinese military assets. Blockade was likewise not a good precursor to invasion because the aggressive action put other countries on alert and, in some cases, resulted in the loss of Chinese assets that would be needed in the event of invasion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendations-preparing-for-and-countering-a-blockade&quot;&gt;Recommendations: Preparing for and Countering a Blockade&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project does not take a position on the likelihood of Chinese military action or on whether the United States should defend Taiwan should Chinese military action occur. However, to the extent that the United States maintains even an ambiguous commitment to Taiwan, it should be prepared to act, should the president decide to do so. Based on the wargaming results and insights, the project developed a set of recommendations for decisionmakers. These recommendations have three goals: (1) to enhance deterrence by showing China that Taiwan and the United States are prepared and cannot be coerced, (2) to allow faster reaction times and produce more effective counter-operations in an emergency, and (3) to discourage other countries from pressuring Taiwan to submit because they hope that a quick resolution would restart normal commerce. The recommended actions did not always thwart a blockade, but they would buy time for a diplomatic solution or outside intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. PREPARE THE MERCHANT FLEETS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number and type of merchant ships that arrive in Taiwan will largely determine material conditions on Taiwan, which will in turn shape the outcome of a blockade. Therefore, the most important measure for pre-conflict preparations is to increase the availability of merchant ships that can make the hazardous run into Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Arrange for mobilization of Taiwanese-owned shipping. The fleet of Taiwanese-owned ships is much larger than the fleet of Taiwanese-flagged ships. Therefore, Taiwan should ensure that all ships whose beneficial owners are Taiwanese are legally subject to requisition in an emergency.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Contract liquified natural gas (LNG) tankers into the Voluntary Intermodal Sealift Agreement (VISA) program and create a Taiwanese equivalent. Because LNG tankers are the greatest shortfall in energy delivery, both the United States and Taiwan should acquire LNG tankers to hold in reserve for emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make plans for managing war risk in the commercial sector. In an emergency, both Taiwan and the United States will need to replace or supplement commercial insurance with guarantees, subsidies, or “reinsurance” to keep maritime and air traffic flowing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plan for transshipment in Japan, Guam, and Australia. Because presumably only ships controlled by the coalition countries will travel to Taiwan during a blockade, there needs to be a place where commercial traffic can transfer cargo to coalition-controlled ships to make the shuttle run into Taiwan. Japan is preferable because it is closer and has excellent port facilities, although ports in Australia and Guam could help. The United States, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia should develop plans for such transshipment points in advance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. PREPARE TAIWAN’S ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Energy is the weakest element in Taiwan’s resilience against coercion. The overwhelming preponderance of energy must be imported and is thus vulnerable to a blockade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Increase Taiwanese energy reserves. Taiwan has done a lot to enhance resilience, particularly with its reserves of oil and coal. Additional inventories could come from building more storage facilities or filling the existing logistics chains on the island before a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maintain and expand resilient energy sources. Taiwan has shifted its sources of energy from coal and nuclear to natural gas and renewables for environmental reasons, but this has greatly increased Taiwan’s energy vulnerability. Taiwan should keep its last nuclear power plant open and capitalize on new technologies to produce safe nuclear energy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Harden energy infrastructure. Taiwan has already made its electrical system more resilient in the face of extreme weather conditions. More hardening is needed for national security reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Expand plans for allocating resources on Taiwan. To ensure the most effective response during an emergency, the Taiwanese government will need to control imports to focus on the most critical items and distribute them to activities with the greatest need. A free-for-all would reduce resilience and undermine the legitimacy of the government’s response.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3. PREPARE CONTINGENCY PLANS FOR THE UNITED STATES TO ASSIST TAIWAN DURING A BLOCKADE.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most scenarios, Taiwan cannot face China alone. If the United States wants to have the capability for keeping Taiwan autonomous and democratic in the face of a Chinese blockade, then it should have plans ready to support Taiwan at a variety of blockade levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rebuild skills and prepare contingency plans to conduct convoys during a blockade. The U.S. Navy is out of practice because convoys have not been a priority mission since the end of the Cold War. Rebuilding these skills will require wargames, training programs, and peacetime exercises with allies and partners. Rebuilding will also require peacetime planning for establishing a convoy system.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make joint plans with allies and partners, especially Japan. The United States will need the support of allies and partners in any conflict with China. Therefore, it should conduct planning now with allies and partners on possible blockade scenarios. Japan is critical in nearly all scenarios and deserves special attention. The United States also needs to align its other policies with its national security priority of competition with China. Otherwise, it may find that allies and partners hang back at the time of need.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make contingency plans for an airlift and military resupply of Taiwan while recognizing the severe limitations of these options. U.S. Transportation Command (TRANSCOM), in conjunction with U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM), needs to have at least concept plans for an airlift, given the centrality of China in U.S. military planning. In conjunction with other measures, an airlift could potentially complicate China’s blockade problem. The president might not execute an airlift or military resupply because of its high cost, political risks, and low deliveries, but TRANSCOM would be derelict in its duties if it did not have plans in place.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;4. PREPARE TO COUNTER AND END A BLOCKADE.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If deterrence fails and the United States decides to counter a Chinese blockade, the United States, in coordination with Japan and Taiwan, must be prepared to respond based on plans made well in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do not treat a blockade like an invasion. Countering a blockade differs from countering an invasion and requires different planning. For example, direct military action against Chinese forces could wait for a week or two until a military and diplomatic coalition can be established.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provide Beijing with off-ramps. The United States and Taiwan should develop a creative menu of offers and responses ahead of time that could allow China to declare victory and lift the blockade without extracting substantive concessions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;observations-across-three-projects&quot;&gt;Observations Across Three Projects&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project is the third in a series of studies conducted by the authors on China’s threat to Taiwan. In all, these projects have run over 70 wargame iterations covering dozens of scenarios, providing a broad view of what might happen in a U.S.-China conflict over Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several common elements in the recommendations across the three projects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even successful campaigns exact heavy casualties, such a conflict would be a shock to the United States, which, since the end of the Cold War, has been accustomed to fighting low-casualty wars with few losses of major weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Off-ramps are valuable because total victory is unachievable when both sides have a secure homeland and nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strong military forces provide the United States with options and, combined with skilled diplomacy, contribute to deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Military operational planning needs to include a broad scope of possible scenarios. Planning is a tool for better senior-level decisionmaking, not a statement of intent to wage war.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Above all, the unexpected can happen. Although war with China is unlikely, it is not impossible, and unlikely events occur. Preparation is vital.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also some tensions between preparations for different contingencies. Preparing for a high-intensity conflict drives Taiwan to adopt a porcupine strategy that relies heavily on defensive systems like ground-based antiship missiles, ground-based air defenses, and sea mines. Countering blockades, on the other hand, requires surface ships, aircraft, and some offensive capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line across three projects: the United States in coordination with its allies and partners must be prepared to deter and, if necessary, fight a wide variety of scenarios. There is no magic bullet that can bring success across all scenarios. Instead, success requires a deep toolbox of capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why Wargame a Blockade of Taiwan?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would happen if China initiated a blockade of Taiwan in the coming years? How could the United States, Japan, and Taiwan best prepare for such a contingency? What escalatory pressures would be created in such scenarios, and how could the United States and Taiwan best manage those pressures? This study aims to answer these questions using a series of wargames based on operations research to provide the U.S., Japanese, and Taiwanese defense communities with a shared framework for systematically analyzing this threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-plausibility-of-chinese-military-action-against-taiwan&quot;&gt;The Plausibility of Chinese Military Action Against Taiwan&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese military action against Taiwan in the coming years is plausible and deserves analysis for five reasons. First, China is increasingly dissatisfied with Taiwan’s apparent commitment to separation and what it sees as trends running against unification (including in U.S. policy), and it has not ruled out the use of force. Second, U.S. policy has long emphasized opposition to unilateral changes to the status quo on Taiwan. Third, Chinese military capabilities continue to improve rapidly. Fourth, U.S. military and political officials have expressed alarm about the possibility of Chinese military action against Taiwan and how the United States could respond in such a scenario. Finally, the Taiwanese and Japanese defense communities are also concerned and have begun preparations for such a contingency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CHINA’S COMMITMENT TO UNIFICATION WITH TAIWAN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing regards Taiwan as an integral part of China. Recognizing what Beijing describes as the “One China” principle (and, in another form, what Washington describes as its “One China” policy) is a precondition for diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic of China (PRC). In an April 2023 press conference, Wang Wenbing, then a spokesman for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, blamed U.S.-China tensions on “‘Taiwan independence’ separatists . . . with the support and connivance of foreign forces” and said, “‘Taiwan independence’ and cross-Strait peace and stability are as irreconcilable as fire and water.” Foreign Minister Qin Gang was equally blunt in a statement made a month prior: “If the United States does not hit the brake but continues to speed down the wrong path . . . there will surely be conflict and confrontation, and who will bear the catastrophic consequences?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing has not forsworn the possible use of force to resolve the “Taiwan issue.” Beijing adopted its Anti-Secession Law in 2005, outlining circumstances in which it might employ force. Indeed, recent statements have been even more pointed. From China’s perspective, U.S. measures such as the Taiwan Travel Act blur the line between unofficial and official diplomatic engagement with Taiwan, violating the terms of the Three Communiques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China frequently conducts threatening military drills in response to unwelcome events as it did with missile tests off Taiwan after President Lee Teng-hui’s 1995 visit to Cornell University and, more recently, with military exercises following House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s 2022 visit to Taipei and President Tsai Ing-wen’s 2023 meeting in Washington, D.C., with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is unclear if China would ever use military force against Taiwan and, if so, when that would be; however, it is plausible that China would take military action against Taiwan in the coming years given this rhetoric. This would place it in conflict with long-standing U.S. policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;U.S. POLICY ON TAIWAN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States adheres to a One China policy and a strategy of strategic ambiguity that does not commit it to the defense of Taiwan. Nevertheless, it leaves open the strong possibility of intervention in the event of an attack on the island. The Taiwan Relations Act, which provides the most authoritative statement about U.S. interests with regard to Taiwan’s future, does not commit the United States to intervention in the event of an attack. However, it stipulates that the United States would consider “any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means” as “of grave concern.” Moreover, of interest to the question of quarantine and blockade, the definition of “other than peaceful means” explicitly includes “boycotts or embargoes.” Another passage stipulates that “it is the policy of the United States . . . to maintain the capacity of the United States to resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion that would jeopardize the security, or the social or economic system, of the people on Taiwan.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last 15 years, as the idea that the United States is engaged in a strategic competition with China has taken hold, Republican and Democratic administrations alike have increasingly emphasized a commitment to Taiwan’s security. This embrace of Taiwan occurred due to growing concerns about the strategic positions of China and the United States in Asia. In 2011, the Obama administration announced it would “rebalance to Asia” and commit more military forces to the region. The 2015 National Military Strategy labeled China as a “revisionist power.” The 2017 National Security Strategy described China as a “strategic competitor.” The 2022 National Security Strategy called it “America’s most consequential geopolitical challenge.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop, it is perhaps not surprising that members of Congress from both parties have consistently pushed legislation for closer (though ostensibly still unofficial) relations with Taiwan. The Biden and Trump administrations have reaffirmed U.S. interest in Taiwan’s security. On three separate occasions, Biden appeared to go beyond established U.S. policy and the provisions of the Taiwan Relations Act in describing a “commitment” to the defense of Taiwan. For example, in 2022, he was asked by a reporter, “Are you willing to get involved militarily to defend Taiwan if it comes to that?” and he replied simply, “Yes . . . that’s the commitment we made.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second Trump administration has not published its strategy documents, so its Taiwan policy has not been clearly articulated. However, several Trump officials are on the record as supporters of strengthening the U.S. commitment to Taiwan. Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Elbridge Colby, for example, argued that “the primary threat to core U.S. interests is that China could dominate Asia, and from that position atop more than half the global economy, undermine Americans’ prosperity, freedom, and even security.” In The Strategy of Denial, he wrote that “If, for instance, the United States and any other participating states fail to defend Taiwan effectively and China can subjugate it, this would remove a key blocking point in the first island chain, add Taiwan’s wealth and power to the pro-hegemonic coalition while removing it from the anti-hegemonic coalition, and weaken U.S. differentiated credibility.” In his confirmation hearings, he reiterated that “Taiwan’s fall would be a disaster for American interests.” Colby has advocated pressing Taiwan to invest heavily in its defenses and increasing U.S. arms sales to Taiwan. Nonetheless, Colby has remained firm on strategic ambiguity, writing that “the costs of explicitly committing to Taiwan’s defense outweigh its benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth made a strong statement of support for Taiwan at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore in May 2025:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;America is proud to be back in the Indo-Pacific—and we’re here to stay. The United States is an Indo-Pacific nation. We have been since the earliest days of our Republic. We will continue to be an Indo-Pacific nation—with Indo-Pacific interests—for generations to come. . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;. . . Let me begin by saying, we do not seek conflict with Communist China. We will not instigate nor seek to subjugate or humiliate. President Trump and the American people have an immense respect for the Chinese people and their civilization. But we will not be pushed out of this critical region. And we will not let our allies and partners be subordinated and intimidated. . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;. . . To be clear: any attempt by Communist China to conquer Taiwan by force would result in devastating consequences for the Indo-Pacific and the world. There’s no reason to sugarcoat it. The threat China poses is real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secretary Hegseth’s strategic guidance to the Department of Defense (DOD) reportedly gives the defense of Taiwan the highest priority. In the 2025 Interim National Defense Strategic Guidance, Hegseth wrote, “China is the Department’s sole pacing threat, and denial of a Chinese fait accompli seizure of Taiwan—while simultaneously defending the U.S. homeland is the Department’s sole pacing scenario.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other senior administration officials have emphasized that the administration’s stance on Taiwan and China remains unchanged. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said, “We have a longstanding position on Taiwan that we’re not going to abandon, and that is: We are against any forced, compelled, coercive change in the status of Taiwan.” All of these policy statements come in response to China’s rapidly increasing military capabilities, which make a “forced, compelled, coercive change” potentially more feasible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Trump’s commitment to Taiwan has been less clear. Unlike President Biden, Trump has doubled down on messages of strategic ambiguity. In December 2024, Trump stated that he would “never say” whether he was committed to defending Taiwan. When asked directly in February 2025, Trump replied, “I never comment on that.” He has also consistently expressed a desire for a positive relationship with China while suggesting that Taiwan must invest much more in its defenses—up to 10 percent of GDP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CHINA’S CONTINUING MILITARY BUILDUP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the late 1990s, China has embarked on a massive military modernization program. Previously, China’s armed forces mainly were land-focused and unable to exert influence at a distance from its borders. Its poor performance in the 1979 border war with Vietnam underscored its weakness, as did the 1996 transit of the Taiwan Strait by a U.S. carrier battle group. A Chinese invasion of Taiwan used to be dismissed as a “million man swim.” However, China has been building military muscle for two decades by pursuing advanced symmetric and asymmetric capabilities that challenge U.S. conventional superiority. The DOD’s 2024 annual report to Congress on China’s military capabilities notes: “In 2023, the PRC continued its efforts to form the PLA into an increasingly capable instrument of national power.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the United States, which has global responsibilities, China’s efforts are focused on a narrow range of missions. Its capabilities have focused on air, naval, and missile systems that can project power in areas around China’s periphery. Weaknesses remain, and the U.S. military maintains superior capabilities in many areas. However, China’s proximity to likely conflict areas, including Taiwan, would make it difficult for the United States to bring those capabilities fully to bear. China has developed capabilities—such as highly accurate and capable land-based ballistic and cruise missiles—to further complicate the threat picture for the United States. While China is producing large warships (destroyers and cruisers) faster than the United States, it can also employ many smaller warships operating from nearby bases. China could use this military power to attempt to resolve the “Taiwan question.” It could invade or bombard Taiwan, seize offshore islands, or impose a blockade. These capabilities and grievances against Taiwan have led to deep concerns in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;U.S. CONCERNS ABOUT CHINESE MILITARY ACTION AGAINST TAIWAN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOD has identified China as the “pacing” challenge, and Congress formed a Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party. Conflict over Taiwan has become central to the U.S. national security debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some U.S. military leaders and strategists are concerned that conflict could occur sooner rather than later. The most well known of these warnings came from Admiral Phil Davidson, commander of INDOPACOM until April 2021, when he testified that the Chinese threat to invade Taiwan “is manifest . . . in the next six years.” This has become known as the “Davidson window”—the time between when China’s buildup continues to strengthen Chinese forces and before new U.S. capabilities come online. Davidson’s successor, Admiral Samuel Paparo, made a similar assessment in his 2025 posture statement to Congress: “Beijing’s aggressive maneuvers around Taiwan are not just exercises. They are dress rehearsals for forced unification.” In January 2023, General Mike Minihan, Air Mobility Command commander, warned in a leaked memo, “My gut tells me we will fight in 2025.” Whether because of improved Chinese capabilities or confusion over the meaning of Xi Jinping’s speech about preparations for 2027, other senior officers have established targets for U.S. capabilities based on that timeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar discussion has played out in the academic and policy worlds. An Atlantic Council survey of subject experts found that 65 percent expected a conflict over Taiwan in the next 10 years. Professors Michael Beckley (Tufts University) and Hal Brands (Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies) warn that “today, China’s risk indicators are blinking red.” They argue that China’s territorial disputes are less susceptible to peaceful resolution, its leadership is overly optimistic about the outcome of war, its long-term economic outlook is darkening, and Xi’s personalist dictatorship is susceptible to disastrous miscalculations. Dimitri Alperovich (chairman of the think tank Silverado Policy Accelerator), Oriana Skylar Mastro (a China specialist at Stanford University), Robert Blackwill (the Henry A. Kissinger senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations), Philip Zelikow (a professor of history at the University of Virginia), Graham Allison (a professor at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government), and many others have raised the alarm about China’s challenge and the immediacy of its military threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall polling of the U.S. population shows concerns, but not at the level of government leaders and subject experts. A 2024 Chicago Council on Global Affairs survey found that 48 percent of the public considered China’s territorial ambitions a critical threat to the United States vital interests, as opposed to 60 percent of government leaders. Sam Roggeveen, director of the International Security Program at the Lowy Institute in Sydney, Australia, observed, “The evidence—or rather, the lack of it—suggest[s] Americans are far less preoccupied with China than those who govern them. America’s China debate is largely confined to its policy elites.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asian allies also worry about U.S. priorities as the United States has moved military forces from Asia to the Middle East in recent years. Turmoil at the Pentagon and the White House’s approach to Europe have not quieted worries that the administration could be similarly unsettled toward Asia in the future. Zack Cooper, an Asia specialist at the American Enterprise Institute, noted that “too much unpredictability could incentivize Beijing to test Trump’s commitment to Taiwan.” U.S. allies and partners have their own concerns about the possibility of Chinese military action and how they should prepare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CONCERNS AMONG TAIWAN AND JAPAN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s leadership views Chinese aggression as a reality, not a possibility, and puts great effort into assessing Taiwan’s vulnerabilities and responding with resilience efforts. The value of national resilience is twofold: ensuring systemic resilience in moments of crisis and amplifying deterrence through perceived preparedness. Northern European countries, such as Sweden and Finland, have set examples of comprehensive resilience efforts to diminish Russian influence. China’s increased gray zone tactics and harassment in recent years have made national resilience central to Lai Ching-te’s presidency. In June 2024, President Lai initiated the Whole-of-Society Defense Resilience Committee, an effort to bring together actors across civil society, government, and the private sector to “build a stronger and more robust democratic society in which we safeguard national security and maintain regional peace and stability.” Taiwan has put on training and exercises, such as the 2025 Urban Resilience Exercises, to simulate crises or attacks and prepare individuals, hospitals, and forces to respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s recent efforts to increase resilience across these domains and many others, such as the energy sector, are extensive and the subject of various in-depth reports. Taiwan relies on imports for 97 percent of its energy supply and operates a highly centralized system. However, by 2026, Taipei hopes that 20 percent of all energy will be renewable, sourced mainly from wind and solar power. Its offshore wind sector currently exceeds two gigawatts, ranking seventh globally in terms of installed capacity, and is still expanding. Taiwan still imports the vast majority of its energy and is working to diversify from where these are sourced. It is reducing dependence on countries with strong ties to China, such as Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Russia, and importing from alternative suppliers like Australia and the United States instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan is expanding its storage capacity and developing more strike-resistant facilities to enhance its current reserves of critical energy supplies like oil, coal, and LNG. Taipower has launched a Grid Resilience Strengthening Construction Plan, which includes targets such as the creation of microgrids, more sustainable indigenous energy production, and increased oil and coal stockpiles. Taiwan has also engaged in significant food and water stockpiling, as a 2021 statistic reported that approximately 70 percent of the average Taiwanese caloric intake is imported. Finally, Taiwan has created multiple departments and increased international and private cooperation to test and improve its cyber and communications infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, military capabilities have also been a key element of government preparations. A conflict with the PLA would be highly asymmetric, so Taiwan has focused on strengthening international cooperation, maintaining weaponry readiness as a deterrent, and improving psychological preparedness. Taiwan’s defense budget has increased annually over the past seven years to 2.5 percent of GDP. Perhaps even more important than military capability is the will of the Taiwanese people and its institutions to resist an invasion or blockade. In May 2025, a show called Zero Day launched, depicting a PLA invasion of Taiwan. The show is part of a larger effort to raise awareness and spur urgency for civil resilience efforts. Alongside public training exercises, Taiwan aims to psychologically prepare its society for an imminent clash with the PRC. Since comprehensive resilience requires a long-term effort, the seemingly shortening timeline of PRC action threatens the effectiveness of these resistance efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan has also become increasingly cognizant of rising regional tensions and the risk of conflict with China. In 2021, Japanese Prime Minister Abe Shinzo stated that a “Taiwan contingency is a Japan contingency.” Japanese leaders recognize how a Taiwanese blockade could draw Japan into military conflict with China, but also of how Chinese ambitions threaten Japanese territory, including the Ryukyu Islands and Okinawa. Chinese gray zone practices and military encroachment have occurred around Japan’s Senkaku Islands—not just in the Taiwan Strait. Japan’s National Security Strategy, released in 2022, claims, “Japan’s security environment is as severe and complex as it has ever been since the end of World War II.” Japanese government documents, including the National Security Strategy, National Defense Strategy, and Defense Buildup Program, pay particular attention to the dimensions of China’s military buildup and Xi’s expansionist statements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine intensified the demands for remilitarization and preparation among Japanese leadership, as it reinforced the concern that China, like Russia, may not adhere to the rules of international order. Japan’s National Defense Strategy illustrates the government’s central takeaway: “The military background for Russia’s aggression against Ukraine was that Ukraine’s defense capability against Russia was insufficient, thus failing to discourage and deter Russian aggression; Ukraine did not possess sufficient capabilities.” In light of these events, Japan has embarked on a significant revision of strategy, foreign policy, and rearmament focused on deterrent military capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PREPARING FOR AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite agreement about the potential threat posed by China, many regional specialists disagree with U.S., Taiwanese, and Japanese concerns about the immediacy of the threat to Taiwan. They argue that there are no specific indicators that a decision for war has been made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Christopher Johnson, a China scholar affiliated with CSIS, observes that at the 2022 party congress, Xi “held fast to the judgment that stability and economic growth continued to be dominant global trends” and that portrayals of Xi as “itching for war” were “overhyped.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bonny Lin (CSIS) and David Sacks (Council on Foreign Relations) argue that China views the use of force as a last resort to achieve unification.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lonnie Henley, a former defense intelligence officer for East Asia at the Defense Intelligence Agency, sees China’s use of force as conditional: “I do not think [the Chinese] will attack Taiwan as long as they believe unification without war remains a viable course of action. They will attack, however, despite the enormous cost and despite any doubts about their own military capabilities, if they judge that peaceful unification is no longer possible, that military force is the only remaining option. That, in turn, is driven by their assessment of political developments in Taipei and Washington.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, William Burns, stated that “President Xi has instructed the PLA, the Chinese military leadership, to be ready by 2027 to invade Taiwan. But that doesn’t mean that he’s decided to invade in 2027 or any other year as well.” Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley similarly emphasized that Xi’s statement was likely about developing a capability to invade Taiwan rather than a concrete plan or intent to do so. Concerning Xi’s speech, he said, “It’s a capability, not an intent to attack or seize.” Xi personally rejected the notion of a timeline, and, notably, his formulation is similar to those used for decades by Chinese leaders to establish capabilities and targets for the military. As discussed above, there is no denying that China’s increasing military strength makes an attack on Taiwan increasingly feasible; although invasion is the most direct and obvious threat, China is not, for example, procuring large numbers of inexpensive amphibious craft that would signal an imminent invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project does not take a position on the likelihood of Chinese military action or on whether the United States should defend Taiwan if Chinese military action occurs. It does argue that military action is plausible given China’s military buildup and aggressive rhetoric and that the United States might respond with military action defending Taiwan. Therefore, studying the nature and dynamics of potential conflicts is a prudent precaution. One way that China could use military force against Taiwan is through a blockade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinese-preparation-of-blockade-capabilities&quot;&gt;Chinese Preparation of Blockade Capabilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese military exercises seem to simulate a blockade of Taiwan. The most dramatic was the August 4, 2022, exercise in connection with then–Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Figure 1.1 shows, these exercises have become more aggressive. In the 1990s, China’s military exercises focused on its coastal area and appeared defensive. By 2022, those exercises surrounded Taiwan and, combined with China’s strident rhetoric, appeared to be highly aggressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/NBRqdMl.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1.1: Comparison of China’s Military Exercises, 1995–1996 and 2022.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://chinapower.csis.org/tracking-the-fourth-taiwan-strait-crisis/&quot;&gt;Bonny Lin et al., “Tracking the Fourth Taiwan Strait Crisis,” ChinaPower, CSIS, updated November 8, 2023&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This pattern has continued. On October 14, 2024, the PLA conducted the exercise Joint Sword-2024B, a few days after President Lai Ching-te’s first National Day address in Taipei. The exercise involved multiservice drills in the sea and air space around Taiwan and included a specific component in which PLA forces practiced their blockade capabilities. This was later followed by Strait Thunder-2025A on April 2, 2025, conducted by the PLA Eastern Theater Command in the Taiwan Strait’s middle and southern sea areas. This exercise focused on joint force capabilities inside and outside the first island chain. The PLA simulated strikes on defense infrastructure such as command centers, arsenals, air defense command posts, and specific locations like the Hengshan Wartime Command Post. It also focused heavily on simulating operations against Taiwanese energy infrastructure and ports, particularly LNG terminals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observing the U.S. interventions in the Gulf War and Kosovo in the 1990s, the PLA began investing heavily in sea denial capabilities to counter U.S. power projection. An island blockade of Taiwan was one of the campaigns identified under the “winning local wars in an informatized environment” strategy described in Chinese defense white papers in the 1990s and 2000s. China has also invested in implementing the PLA’s operational doctrine to support “integrated joint operations” in which the PLA envisions unified operations of units from all services under a single command and control network. From the concept’s adoption in the late 1990s, the PLA identified a blockade campaign as an operation the PLA would have to prosecute as a joint force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second edition of the PLA textbook, Science of Campaigns, a “joint blockade campaign” is described as a combined arms, joint offensive campaign with a unified command to “sever enemy economic and military connections with the outside world.” PLA writings have also used the term “strategic blockade,” which intends to isolate and weaken an enemy’s combat capabilities “so as to directly achieve strategic goals or create conditions for the implementation of the next strategic action.” More recently, Chinese military officials have begun to use the term “joint blockade and control,” emphasizing maintaining control over the blockaded region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If China imposed a blockade on Taiwan tomorrow and the United States was drawn in, no one would slap their forehead and exclaim, “Didn’t see that coming!” However, the form that a blockade would take is not clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;blockade-can-take-many-forms&quot;&gt;Blockade Can Take Many Forms&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A blockade constitutes a fundamentally different challenge than an invasion because both sides are potentially fighting at levels below total war. Invasion constitutes China’s most dangerous course of action. For that reason, CSIS’s earlier project The First Battle of the Next War: Wargaming a Chinese Invasion of Taiwan examined a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. China’s commitment to an invasion must be total for it to succeed. There are no half-measures by which China could have only some of its forces committed and try to occupy only part of Taiwan. While any Chinese effort to use military force against Taiwan risks a broader war, a blockade might be able to accomplish political aims without all of the risks entailed by an invasion. As Cold War strategist Thomas Schelling put it, “Blockade, harassment, and ‘salami tactics’ can be interpreted as ways of evading the dangers and difficulties of compellence.” Thus, a blockade could take many forms depending on how much military and political risk China wanted to assume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its least escalatory form, China could impose a non-kinetic blockade of Taiwan—likely using another term such as “quarantine” or “law enforcement action”—as a coercive measure to slowly force Taiwan into compliance while avoiding armed confrontation. A 2024 CSIS report by Bonny Lin et al. describes two potential law enforcement–led approaches: (1) a limited maritime quarantine that focuses on one port, and (2) a full maritime quarantine. In each scenario, China aims to punish Taiwan, assert sovereignty over Taiwan, test international shipping responses, and pressure China’s adversaries. Instead of hermetically sealing Taiwan, a quarantine is presented as a less-provocative alternative that allows gradual escalation while still demonstrating Chinese authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Isaac Kardon (Carnegie Endowment for International Peace) and Jennifer Kavanagh (Defense Priorities) argue that while Taiwan has been the target of increasing gray zone activities, these are not necessarily a prelude to an invasion. Instead, China could use persistent coercive measures to subjugate Taiwan “in the ways that matter” without requiring formal capitulation. Robert Manning (Stimson) made a similar argument, arguing that China has already adopted a “non-Kinetic strategy.” Finally, an analysis by RAND also concluded that China could use a non-kinetic quarantine or blockade of this nature to put the escalation burden on the United States or Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A blockade could also involve broader military action, although the parameters of such action may vary widely. In a 2024 CSIS report that surveyed 35 Taiwanese experts and 52 U.S. experts, 89 percent and 64 percent, respectively, responded that Beijing was likely or very likely to resort to a blockade of Taiwan if China sought forceful unification in the next five years. In 2004, Michael Glosny, an Asia expert at the Naval Postgraduate School, examined a scenario where China uses submarines and sea mines to blockade Taiwanese ports. He argued that a PLA submarine blockade would not succeed, as the limited damage it would inflict would not be sufficient to force Taiwan to capitulate, especially given Taiwan’s will to resist. However, much has changed in the ensuing two decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael O’Hanlon, a national security scholar at Brookings Institution who has done extensive work on a Chinese blockade of Taiwan, identified two kinetic scenarios: a maritime fight centered on submarines (similar to Glosny) and a broader subregional war. He highlights the unpredictability of the outcomes for the United States and China, arguing that the conflict ought to be avoided, as it would be highly escalatory but would not end in a resolution of Taiwan’s status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Casey, former director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, argues that a joint blockade campaign would not only target maritime trade but also include limited strikes on Taiwanese ports, airfields, and other infrastructure. These attacks would aim to degrade Taiwan’s defenses before a subsequent amphibious invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some experts see a blockade as a prelude to or follow-on to an invasion. Lonnie Henley, a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, describes how if the PLA wanted to launch an invasion, a joint blockade campaign would focus on setting the conditions for a landing campaign—gaining air superiority, isolating Taiwan from U.S. reinforcements, and crippling Taiwan’s communications and logistics infrastructure. He has separately detailed how a blockade could follow an unsuccessful invasion attempt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With so many permutations of a “blockade” scenario, a shared framework for analysis is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-need-for-a-shared-framework&quot;&gt;The Need for a Shared Framework&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;National leaders have not missed the necessity of understanding a blockade scenario. Congress has expressed concern about China imposing a blockade in the Taiwan Strait. Senator Tom Cotton recently published a book on the threat he believes China represents to the American people and has emphasized how an invasion of Taiwan threatens American power and prosperity. In FY 2023 and FY 2024, the National Defense Authorization Act has included provisions requiring preparations for Taiwan to defend against a Chinese blockade. In FY 2024, Congress requested an independent study of such a scenario and its potential economic impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previous analyses provided important insights about how and why a blockade might occur, but they have not holistically analyzed the broad set of military and quasi-military capabilities available to China. Therefore, the state of analysis in the area of coercive blockade is underdeveloped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report aims to fill this gap in the literature by appraising the range of blockade scenarios wherein China uses ships, submarines, and aircraft to interdict maritime traffic to Taiwan outside of an invasion in 2028. While this does not include sanctions or invasion, it covers a wide range of Chinese coercive actions that have not previously been included in the analytic conversation. Establishing an analytic structure, identifying important variables, and assessing outcomes under different assumptions will show how China might impose a blockade and, if imposed, what the United States, Taiwan, and its allies might do to counter it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;report-structure&quot;&gt;Report Structure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remainder of this report comprises five chapters:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chapter 2, “Blockades in History and the Current Literature,” provides the context for a notional Chinese blockade of Taiwan. It has a brief history of blockades, a description of why alternatives to supply by sea are insufficient, a legal analysis of blockades, and an assessment of their economic effects and global impact.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chapter 3, “A Framework for Analyzing a Blockade,” begins by noting the scope conditions of the report. It then describes the escalation levels for China and the coalition and how the escalation levels combine to produce scenarios. It then describes variations within each scenario. Finally, it describes how the wargames in each scenario and variant were conducted.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chapter 4, “Wargaming a Blockade,” describes how the project used wargames to analyze the various scenarios of the framework. It describes the three modules of wargaming a blockade and the models that were used in each module.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chapter 5, “Analysis of Wargame Results,” begins by explaining the lack of fixed victory conditions and then summarizes game results. The first result is the “Zero Baseline,” which shows what an absolute blockade would do under three different conditions in Taiwan: Base, Prepared, and More Green Energy. The chapter then lays out results from the individual scenarios and variants within them. Additionally, it lays out the results and significant decisions of the free-play games. Although these free-play games were shorter in game time than the others (5 weeks versus 20 weeks), they involved more people and gave insights into escalation dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chapter 6, “Policy Recommendations and Conclusion,” lays out recommendations from analyzing the wargame results described in the previous chapter. The recommendations are divided into four groups: preparing the merchant fleet, preparing Taiwan’s energy infrastructure, preparing the United States to assist Taiwan during a blockade, and, if a blockade were to occur, actions for countering and ending it. Within each group, recommendations are listed in priority order.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Appendices (forthcoming in August 2025) provide details on Taiwan’s food requirements and supply, available coalition shipping, sea mines, airlift, escalation levels, the stance of other countries, the effects of Chinese attacks on Taiwan’s electricity production, and turn-by-turn actions in the free-play games.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;blockades-in-history-and-the-current-literature&quot;&gt;Blockades in History and the Current Literature&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter gives the context for a notional Chinese blockade of Taiwan. It provides a brief history of blockades, a description of why alternatives to supply by sea are insufficient, the legal aspects of blockades, and the likely economic effects and global impact of a blockade of Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-brief-history-of-blockades&quot;&gt;A Brief History of Blockades&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naval blockades have a long history; they are a common tactic in warfare, being described, for example, by Thucydides 2,400 years ago in his account of the Peloponnesian War. This chapter briefly reviews the literature on blockades and gives a few illustrative examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Successful blockades require prolonged military efforts to take effect. The Peloponnesian War saw Sparta build several fleets over decades (with Persian money) to eventually cut off Athens’s grain supplies. In the U.S. Civil War, the Union eventually built a fleet large enough to squeeze the Confederacy and inflict considerable damage to the economy and hardship on the population. Similarly, in World War I, Great Britain imposed a “distant blockade” that took years to have a significant effect but eventually caused mass starvation and food riots in Germany. Although the blockading party maintained economic leverage in each of these cases, the target of the blockade was still able to continue military operations for many years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tools of blockading have also varied throughout history. For much of history, the tools were ships and fortifications. The twentieth century added sea mines and aircraft. However, technological advancement and globalization have created new complexities and changes to historical blockade tactics. Globalized supply chains create systemic interdependence and offer increased opportunities for alternative suppliers and rerouting. Advanced missile systems, especially antiship missiles, raise the risk of escalation on both sides of the blockade. Other naval defenses, including submarines, threaten blockading forces. Electronic and cyber warfare offer alternative means for pressuring an opponent. Meanwhile, signal disruption could reduce the efficacy of a modern naval blockade. Thus, although blockades are a millennia-old practice, tactics continue to evolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fighting through a blockade requires large amounts of merchant shipping. During World War I, Great Britain relied so heavily on merchant ships for food, resources, and military transport that King George V granted them the “Merchant Navy” title. During wartime, these large merchant fleets also suffered significant losses; Britain’s merchant fleet stood at approximately 200,000 sailors in 1939 but lost 29,000 merchant sailors by the end of World War II. Civilian mariners of the U.S. Merchant Marine played similarly crucial but costly roles in the United States’ efforts in World War II. Japan’s merchant fleet was devastated by U.S. forces. In all, Japan’s merchant fleet, the third-largest of the global powers, lost 2,346 ships in the Pacific War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intense armed conflict during blockades leads to high attrition among combatants and merchants. Particularly relevant to a blockade of Taiwan is the unsuccessful siege of Malta from 1940 to 1943. In that case, convoys periodically broke through the German-Italian air and naval blockade and sustained the island, though at great cost. For example, the 1942 Pedestal convoy began with 37 warships (2 battleships, 3 carriers, 7 cruisers, and 25 destroyers) escorting 14 merchant ships. It endured continuous air and naval attacks in its three-day passage from the Strait of Gibraltar to Malta. Five warships, including one carrier, were lost, and only four merchant ships survived, but it was enough. Malta held out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially when combined with other forms of military operations, blockades do not need to be 100 percent effective in stopping traffic to accomplish their goals. They need to squeeze enough that the target population feels hardship and its military forces lose some effectiveness. One example is the Union blockade of the Confederacy during the U.S. Civil War. Although the Union fleet failed to interdict over 90 percent of blockade runners, it intercepted enough ships and discouraged enough trade that the blockade was ultimately effective in squeezing the Confederacy. In World War I, Germany continued to receive goods shipped through Scandinavia despite the British blockade. Despite these shipments, the World War I British official history estimates that the urban population of Germany only received 1,000 calories per day in the latter half of 1917, contributing to a death rate that was 32.2 times greater than in peacetime as a result of deaths from starvation and disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, a blockade’s success is contingent on the willpower of both sides. Many blockaded states have outlasted their blockaders despite extreme hardship. As a blockade relies on the targeted state capitulating, there are, therefore, important interactions between diplomacy, willpower, and escalation dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ESCALATION AND DIPLOMACY DURING BLOCKADES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naval blockades have been used as a coercive tactic to avoid escalation to kinetic conflict. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, U.S. naval forces established a blockade around Cuba to prevent Soviet military supplies from reaching the island. The U.S. blockade lasted a month, ending once the Soviet Union agreed to remove its missiles from Cuba. In this case, the naval blockade successfully forced enemy ships to turn back, and no shots were fired between U.S. and Soviet vessels. China may opt for a similar option, establishing control over Taiwan’s maritime trade while remaining under the threshold of armed conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Quasi-War in 1798, French privateers intercepted and seized U.S. merchant ships intended for Great Britain and its colonies. Although the two parties did not declare war, the French navy seized over 300 American merchant ships, including some in U.S. waters. U.S. Navy ships deployed to the Caribbean in response and fought several naval engagements against the French in an “undeclared war.” In recent years, China has adopted a similar strategy of interfering with neutral vessels in the South China Sea, albeit at a smaller scale. The Chinese Coast Guard has routinely interfered with supply shipments to a Philippine marine detachment near the disputed Second Thomas Shoal. In a blockade of Taiwan, China could use a strong maritime law enforcement process and similarly coercive tactics to intimidate neutral vessels and force compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blockades are also characterized by the diplomatic difficulties for the blockading state. The Union struggled to keep a tight blockade of the Confederacy when faced with British and French blockade runners, at times having to relax its blockade to avoid escalation. Roles were reversed in World War I, when U.S. shipments to Germany continued for the initial years of the war despite British protests. In the Soviet blockade of Berlin in 1948–1949, Soviet aircraft harassed allied cargo aircraft but backed off after some crashes and casualties. A U.S. airlift into Taiwan would pose a similar dilemma to China—shoot down aircraft with humanitarian supplies and take worldwide criticism or allow the flights, hoping that they would not alter the outcome of the blockade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CONVOYS AND SHUTTLES AGAINST BLOCKADES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;States subject to blockade also often find that establishing a shipping “shuttle” is the best use for the merchant ships under its control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a shuttle has, as its two terminal points, the blockaded nation’s ports on the one hand and one or more designated ports outside the blockade zone as the other terminals. From the external terminal, inbound goods are transshipped onto the shuttle fleet for running into the blockaded country, and outbound goods are transshipped onto regular commercial shipping for their final destinations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a shuttle recognizes that most commercial merchant ships will not accept the extreme risk of operating in a combat zone. Only ships mobilized by the belligerents will do that. A shuttle offers two additional benefits. First, it allows the blockade-running fleet to move goods out of the dangerous area quickly, increasing the circulation of such shipping and making the most of a relatively small fleet. Second, it allows planners to optimize merchant fleets for effective or efficient blockade running. The combined benefits outweigh the burden of transferring cargo from one ship to another. Some examples illustrate this point:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During the American Revolution, U.S. and other ships running the British blockade similarly leveraged bases in French and Dutch territories in the Caribbean to transship goods to and from European continental ports.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During the U.S. Civil War, Confederate and European (primarily British) blockade runners ran shipping between southern ports, such as Charleston, South Carolina, and transshipment points in the Bahamas. The trip between Nassau (Bahamas) and Charleston, at 563 nautical miles (nm), was far shorter than that to the ultimate points of origin or destination, whether Liverpool (3,200 nm) or Amsterdam (3,700 nm). A transshipment point maximized the employment of the specialized ships employed in blockade running—maneuverable steamships of shallow draft and relatively small capacity, poorly designed for safely or efficiently hauling cargoes on Atlantic crossings.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During the Iran-Iraq War (1980–1988), Iran and Iraq engaged in extensive mutual attacks on shipping and infrastructure, with a focus on limiting oil production and shipping. A total of 329 ships bound for or coming from Iran were damaged or sunk throughout the war, including 212 by Exocet missiles. In February 1985, Iran established an escorted shuttle service to move oil from Kharg Island, roughly 100 nm from the Iraqi coast, to Sirri, where oil could be safely transshipped onto general shipping. The shuttle enabled Iran to maximize the use of ships (originally 17 in number) operated by risk-acceptant foreign firms, often under long-term (six-month or one-year) insurance contracts for operations within the hazardous waters around Kharg. Similarly, under threat from Iranian attack, Kuwaiti shipping shuttled between Kuwait and the port of Khor Fakkan on the United Arab Emirates’ east coast, outside the Strait of Hormuz. Kuwait employed its own tankers on this route, 11 of which were reflagged under U.S. colors after the start of Operation Earnest Will.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since it invaded Ukraine, Russia has also engaged in oil transshipment to avoid international sanctions. Due to its dark fleet and transshipment regime, Russia’s GDP has increased despite the pressures of wartime and sanctions. After leaving Russian Baltic and Black Sea ports, uninsured tankers perform ship-to-ship (STS) transfers in international waters. Automatic Identification System data and satellite imagery show that most Russian STS transfers are occurring around a few key water hubs: the Gulf of Laconia (near Greece), Ceuta (near Spain), Hurd’s Bank (near Malta), and Constanța (Romania). Receiver vessels, which are often reflagged and sail with protection and indemnity insurance, flow from these hubs in the Mediterranean to final destinations worldwide, evading sanctions by concealing the oil’s transshipment and origins.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-insufficiency-of-alternatives-to-merchant-shipping&quot;&gt;The Insufficiency of Alternatives to Merchant Shipping&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) would make it almost impossible for large merchant ships to evade detection during a blockade. As discussed in the description of Module 2 in Chapter 4, this ISR system would be highly effective against conventional shipping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difficulties that merchant ships would have in reaching Taiwan during a blockade have encouraged analysts to consider alternative means of transportation. One possibility is airlift; some have referenced the Berlin Airlift of 1948–1949 as an analogous case. Another possibility involves unconventional maritime means, such as blockade running, “cocaine logistics,” “ant logistics,” and submarines. While some alternative means of transportation can help in certain circumstances—and are therefore included in the project’s modeling—none are adequate alternatives to merchant ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;AIRLIFTS AND THE BERLIN AIRLIFT PRECEDENT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Berlin Airlift successfully sustained the city until diplomacy resolved the crisis, and under the right circumstances, an airlift to Taiwan might similarly buy time. Importantly, those circumstances are not guaranteed to hold. (Appendix D, forthcoming, contains additional details on a Taiwan airlift, and a backup paper has the full analysis.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Berlin Airlift&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Berlin Airlift ran from June 1948 to September 1949 after the Soviet Union cut all land connections between the U.S., UK, and French occupation zones in Berlin and western Germany. The Soviet Union did not interfere with air traffic, so the Western allies organized an airlift. Supplies went by sea to German ports and then by rail to nine airfields in the western zone. Cargo aircraft flew from there along three air corridors to Berlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge was enormous. The supply demands were set at 4,500 short tons per day. Daily food requirements were 1,500 tons, while coal for electricity and heating purposes totaled 3,500 tons. With a population of 2.8 million, this amounted to 3.2 pounds per person per day. In total, 2,325,000 tons of supplies arrived between June 1948 and September 1949. At its peak, in August 1949, daily cargo flights reached 924. Overall, they averaged 680 flights per day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three measures greatly enhanced the airlift’s capacity: First was a steady increase in lift capacity with the commitment of more high-capacity U.S. C-54 Skymasters. Second was the expansion of Berlin’s airport infrastructure, including constructing new runways at Tempelhof and a new airport, Tegel. Third was an increase in efficiency. Over time, the average turnaround time in Berlin was reduced to 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, demand was met, and the blockade failed. Economic activity in Berlin came to a standstill, but daily calorie intake in West Berlin went above the West German and UK average by the end of the airlift (2,300 kcal/day). The Soviet Union lifted the blockade in July 1949. The blockade proved a diplomatic and political disaster for the Soviet reputation. U.S. prestige soared. The creation of NATO and West Germany were indirect results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Case Comparison: Berlin (1948–1949) and Taiwan (2028)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their seminal work on historical analogy, Richard Neustadt and Ernest May encourage analysts to probe “whether the folk wisdom [about the past] really applies ‘now.’ What are likenesses and differences?” How does the Taiwan case compare to the Berlin blockade? Table 2.1 below compares the Berlin Airlift with a hypothetical Taiwan airlift across key characteristics to illuminate these likenesses and differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both cases, the United States and its partners have immense resources they can bring to bear and the capability to execute, or at least attempt, an airlift. As in the Berlin case, there would also likely be strong public support for a Taiwan airlift. The differences are also important. The most significant difference is scale. Taiwan’s population is eight times that of Berlin’s in 1948. Aircraft supporting a Taiwan airlift would also have to fly much longer distances, though the difference is partially offset by the greater capacity and range of today’s aircraft. Taiwan’s economy is far more energy intensive than Berlin’s, and at least some of its chief power sources, especially natural gas, would be difficult, if not impossible, to transport by air. Partly offsetting the problem, there is a reduced need for heating because Taipei’s average winter temperatures are warmer than those of Berlin (by between 25 and 30 degrees Fahrenheit).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 2.1: Comparison of the Berlin Airlift with a Hypothetical Taiwan Airlift.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ research and analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Analysis and Results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project assessed the ability of an airlift by the United States and its partners to keep the Taiwanese population fed and minimally supplied with other essentials. The assessment considers Taiwan’s requirements, the number and capacity of available U.S. cargo aircraft, sortie duration and frequency, cargo loading and unloading, and the potential contribution of U.S. allies. The analysis benchmarks Taiwan’s requirements to those of Berlin during the Berlin Airlift (3.65 pounds per day). For Taiwan’s population of 23.6 million, the total subsistence requirement would be 86 million pounds (43,070 tons) per day. Of that, most would be energy supplies and the rest food and emergency materials like medical items and spare parts for critical systems. Satisfying this demand would require 860 sorties per day based on standard aircraft loading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subject to the important conditions noted below, the analysis finds that an airlift could provide this minimum level of existence in Taiwan and prevent catastrophic loss of life. Under particularly favorable circumstances, an airlift could provide a somewhat higher level of support. However, an airlift does not represent a long-term solution. It would require nearly all U.S. strategic mobility assets, greatly reducing the United States’ ability to respond to other global crises. Moreover, even the highest levels of delivery would not stave off the collapse of the Taiwanese economy. The key problem would be energy, since all the materials are heavy and natural gas is difficult or impossible to transport without specially designed transportation systems. Total electricity production might be reduced to 20 percent of pre-blockade electricity levels. Nevertheless, assuming that the necessary circumstances aligned, an airlift could provide some breathing room for diplomats to resolve a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Important conditions apply to these moderately positive conclusions. First, key partners must support the effort. An airlift operating from U.S. territory alone (Guam) could not bring enough supplies. Adding U.S. bases in Japan would be adequate, though just barely. Including bases in the Philippines and civilian airports in Japan would increase the flow and hedge against adverse events. Allies and partners might find participation in an airlift to be politically easier than in a kinetic military operation because of the former’s humanitarian nature and the generally lower risk involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second condition is a permissive environment and no substantial Chinese attack on the airflow or bases. An airlift opposed by China’s full military power would be impossible to execute. Notably, the Soviet Union did not interfere with the Berlin Airlift. China might conclude that an attack would cause significant numbers of fatalities and make China look like the aggressor in ways that boarding or seizing ships would not. It might also hope that the airlift would fail even without attack. Interference beyond harassment would push the situation from an airlift to a kinetic war, with all the risks associated with such an escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;UNCONVENTIONAL MARITIME METHODS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A variety of unconventional maritime sources would arise spontaneously or be proposed. Examples include private blockade running, submarine resupply, “cocaine logistics” (the use of small covert means), and “rat logistics” (the use of military craft during periods of limited visibility).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These smaller ships might evade Chinese surveillance by hiding in the regular stream of traffic and making a dash to Taiwan, disguising themselves as a fishing or research vessel, or using low observability to evade detection. Numbers would also be an advantage. These advantages would increase in a contested blockade where Chinese ships were driven back or forced to defend themselves. This would make the blockade more porous. The advantages that the “mice” would have in this cat-and-mouse game of blockade and blockade running mean that alternatives to traditional cargo shipping deserve examination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Private and Quasi-Private Blockade Running&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basic economics drives efforts at blockade running in virtually all historical cases. Blockades reduce the supply of certain goods, and this drives up prices. At some point, the high price justifies the risk of interception and use of inefficient means of transportation. In other words, crisis spawns entrepreneurship. Official or unofficial authorization of such trade by Taiwan and the ports of embarkation (likely Japan or the Philippines) permits a much larger amount of imports. Blockade runners can then focus on getting past the adversary’s obstruction rather than loading, landing, and offloading successfully. Nevertheless, some blockade running would happen even if not authorized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although materials for blockade running might come from great distances, a two-stage process typically evolves similarly to, though separate from, the system for official blockade convoys (see the convoy shuttle section above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Chinese blockade of Taiwan would induce the emergence of private blockade runners of many sorts, mainly ships, though some private aircraft might risk the trip. Blockade running could use a wide variety of navigational approaches to Taiwan and employ techniques that would not be available to official shipping, such as using disguised identities, showing different national flags, turning off location transponders, and operating with forged papers. Russia, for example, has created a “ghost fleet” and used these techniques to evade sanctions on its oil. Blockade-running vessels could hide among the mass of shipping in East Asia and then dash into Taiwanese territorial waters. Figure 2.2 shows how heavy just one element of this traffic is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/NC4Xt0M.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blockade runners could be as large as container ships or as small as private yachts. Smaller ships, although inefficient for regular sea transportation, are easier to conceal, an acceptable trade-off during a blockade. Because of their generally smaller sizes, blockade runners could use a wider variety of ports and airfields, thus avoiding Chinese surveillance of the larger ports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and private charities might send supplies to Taiwan using their own means. These NGOs might operate overtly as humanitarian relief under international law or clandestinely to avoid engagement with the Chinese government. The war in Ukraine has seen such organizations arise spontaneously outside official channels to provide everything from medical supplies to weapons. The Taiwanese diaspora would likely take the lead in creating such NGOs. Existing NGOs might participate with a strictly humanitarian focus, while others would spring up in response to the blockade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blockade running would not bring in the full range of products needed by Taiwan. Historically, runners have focused on high-value items to maximize profits. These unofficial sources are particularly helpful in providing nonessentials that ease the sacrifices that the blockades impose on daily life. Ship and cargo compatibility also shapes what blockade runners can transport. A wide variety of ships can carry dry, non-bulk products without tailored configurations. Although oil products require specialized ships and offloading facilities, the ships are widely available, as are offload facilities in Taiwan. Smuggling LNG would be nearly impossible because it requires access to specialized ships, which would be much more challenging to secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this history, the wargame includes mechanisms for blockade running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Cocaine Logistics”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Cocaine logistics” refers to the use of covert, expendable, and often improvised platforms that drug runners use to smuggle illegal drugs into the United States and other countries. It represents a subcategory of blockade running. One possibility is a manned or unmanned semi-submersible (technically “low-profile vessels”). Low silhouettes make these hard to detect. They are not submersible; that capability requires a sophisticated design and a highly trained crew. Several U.S. military officers have suggested that such craft might be used to resupply dispersed Marine Corps units inside the Chinese defensive bubble during a conflict, and the concept could be expanded to blockade running. However, a typical semi-submersible has a roughly five-ton capacity—sufficient for smuggling high-value cargoes like cocaine but too small to meet Taiwan’s needs. Supplying an island of 23 million is vastly more challenging than resupplying 100 Marines in a small enclave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situation is similar with aircraft. Criminal organizations use slow and small single-engine aircraft to transport drugs because the aircraft are hard to detect when flying at low altitudes in remote areas. These aircraft have a range of only ~300 nm, so they must launch from nearby airfields. Criminal organizations use private jets for transoceanic flights to intermediate airfields and then use these small aircraft to transport cargo from intermediate airfields to consumption centers. Because the small aircraft can carry only 500 pounds of cargo, they are well suited for delivering high-value, low-weight products (like cocaine) but unsuited for general cargo delivery. Even 100 daily flights by such aircraft—a heroic assumption—would provide only 25 tons, or .06 percent of Taiwan’s 43,070-ton daily requirement. By contrast, a single C-17 sortie can deliver about 40 tons, 10 times as much as a semi-submersible and 200 times as much as a small aircraft. Further, the C-17 is a versatile aircraft with a range of 2,400 nm and can operate on austere airfields with short, narrow runways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Japanese “Ant” and “Rat” Logistics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During World War II, Japan developed an alternative logistics system that used barges (“ant” logistics), fast destroyers at night (“rat” logistics), and submarines to make covert deliveries. These methods employed new tactics that used night, reduced visibility, and geography to evade U.S. air superiority. During the 1942–1943 Solomon Islands campaign, the U.S. Navy called this effort the “Tokyo Express” and devoted considerable effort to interdict it. The Japanese effort was only partially successful. Japan had to supplement these meager logistics with covert gardens and mass extractions from locals. Many garrisons held out until the end of the war, albeit with mass deaths from starvation and illnesses resulting from malnourishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a system has only limited parallels with a Taiwan blockade. With the advent of near-persistent satellite coverage, long-loitering high-altitude unmanned aerial vehicles, and synthetic aperture radars that can see through clouds and darkness, there would not be any comparable window for military blockade running to Taiwan during a conflict with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Submarine Supply&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a historical precedent for supply by submarine. Germany built specially designed cargo submarines in World War I (Deutschland and Bremen) and World War II (Type XIVs, nicknamed “milk cows”), as did Italy (R class and 10 submarine conversions). Japan used submarines to resupply bypassed and isolated garrisons during World War II. Thus, submarine resupply has sometimes been suggested as a possibility for Taiwan. Although such covert means have intuitive appeal, the amount of cargo carried would be negligible, and any use of U.S. submarines for the task would divert them from critical warfighting capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Submarines could not deliver substantial cargo because they are poorly configured for that purpose. There is little storage space, and efforts to increase loading could endanger buoyancy. Further, there are no means to load or offload rapidly. Hatches are small, and everything would need to be moved manually. Only the four nuclear-powered guided missile submarines (SSGNs) have substantial storage space because of their origins as ballistic missile submarines and their current secondary mission of special forces insertion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of potential offload is instructive: Assume all four U.S. guided-missile submarines (SSGs) and 12 additional nuclear-powered attack submarines (SSNs) are taken from other missions. Optimistically, a regular SSN might carry 200 tons of cargo and an SSGN might carry 500 tons. Operating from Guam, the forward-most U.S. submarine base, each round trip would require eight days (three days for each leg and one day on each for loading and unloading). On average, then, one SSGN would arrive in Taiwan every two days and three SSNs every two days. Average daily deliveries would be 650 tons. Given a minimum island delivery requirement of 43,070 tons (see previous section on airlift), that satisfies only 1.5 percent of the total requirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this comes at a huge warfighting cost because it wastes submarine capabilities, a prime warfighting asset. The First Battle of the Next War report noted that in repeated wargame iterations, “inside the [Taiwan] strait, U.S. submarines wreaked havoc on Chinese shipping.” It was called the “happy time” for U.S. submarines. Virtually every analysis of Navy force structure recommends increasing the number of submarines. However, U.S. submarine force levels will decline in the near term because of low production rates in the 1990s and will not reach the current level again until the mid-2030s. Industrial base constraints prevent any additional submarines from getting to the fleet before the late 2030s beyond those already planned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line: The combination of small deliveries and major warfighting decrement means that this option is a nonstarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Summary of Unconventional Methods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite their shortcomings in volume, alternate means of supply could be useful in three ways. First, the existence of blockade runners might force China to institute a close blockade that would include a heavy presence “on station” in areas off Taiwan’s coasts. This would potentially place blockading ships in exposed positions close enough to shore to be struck by land-based antiship missiles—an advantage for Taiwan if the blockade turns kinetic. Second, a swarm of low-profile vessels and aircraft could distract Chinese blockaders from larger vessels. Although a cost-benefit approach for China might be to ignore these small vessels as insignificant, that would be hard to do given their visibility and symbolism. Finally, they would produce a psychological boost to the Taiwanese population. Blockade runners make for tales of heroism, and crews would become celebrities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, these potential benefits are ancillary compared to the lack of volume that alternate methods could deliver. It would take about 5,000 of the largest narco-submarines ever caught to equal the size of the smallest class of bulk carriers. A fleet of these would have to be rapidly available to provide a consistent stream of traffic to Taiwan. An airlift might sustain Taiwan at a subsistence level in a scenario of lower Chinese escalation levels, but it could not provide the volume needed to maintain Taiwan’s economy. At higher escalation levels, China could interdict these large and slow transport aircraft. This method is also incapable of transporting the desperately needed LNG. Thus, although any analysis should account for deliveries by airlift and blockade runners when appropriate, these alternative methods cannot replace merchant ships. This report therefore focuses on conventional merchant ships as the primary mover of supplies to Taiwan during a blockade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;legal-aspects-of-blockades&quot;&gt;Legal Aspects of Blockades&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the belligerents might not feel tightly bound by international law in the extreme conditions of a conflict, the global community would examine it closely. China has spent years building its case and legal arsenal, deliberately mobilizing lawyers and academics by encouraging their creative, and sometimes confusing, scholarship and enacting domestic laws useful to a government preparing for war. The United States, too, has efforts underway. The legal domain will, therefore, be part of any U.S.-China conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A strong case under international law would help the United States and its partners build a broader global coalition to counter the blockade. It would, for example, facilitate the imposition and enforcement of sanctions. It would also help shore up domestic support to endure hardships and set the stage for whatever settlement and regional order can be achieved after the confrontation. While most countries would prefer to avoid the legal and diplomatic issues that arise from a blockade of Taiwan, the blockade’s unavoidable disruption of the global economy will force almost every state to take a stance. Ultimately, the global community will decide the status and effectiveness of a “blockade” by their reaction to it. The United States might decide to shape some military operations to secure a favorable international reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;HOW DOES THIS AFFECT THE BLOCKADE WARGAME?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth beginning by considering how legal matters affect the wargame. The items below are decisions in the wargame that depend on the attitudes of other countries. Legal arguments influence these decisions by creating a favorable or unfavorable global political environment for the United States and Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Operations from U.S. bases in foreign countries. This is especially important for bases in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Transshipment of cargo in Japan or Australia. To be viable, convoys need ports where global shipping can transfer cargo onto ships willing to make the risky run into Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provision of national merchant shipping and escorts by other nations. Some countries might be willing to have their national merchant fleets run the gauntlet protected by their own warships.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Authorization of overflight and logistics by countries such as Singapore, which will not be directly involved. Overflight and logistics help the United States because the conflict is being conducted 8,000 miles from the U.S. mainland.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Humanitarian supplies being shipped to Taiwan with China’s acquiescence. Humanitarian organizations will want to send emergency supplies to Taiwan, but China will prohibit this unless put under enough pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Airlift and blockade running. These require bases in other countries, particularly Japan and the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Open-market sales of merchant ships during a crisis. In some scenarios, the United States and Taiwan need additional merchant ships, especially to fill gaps and replace losses. Without the cooperation of other countries, these purchases would be difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;WHAT IS A BLOCKADE?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis begins with a definition: A blockade is a “belligerent operation to prevent vessels and/or aircraft of all States, enemy and neutral, from entering or exiting specified ports, airfields, or coastal areas belonging to, occupied by, or under the control of an enemy State.” A vast body of international law governs the operation of a blockade. There are, for example, requirements for notification, effectiveness (no paper blockades), impartial application to all states, treatment of neutral vessels and ports, the location of blockading forces, and methods of inspection. A blockade is therefore an action between sovereign nations and an act of war. However, because so few countries recognize Taiwan as a sovereign entity, applying this vast corpus of law will be difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;IS THIS AN INTERNATIONAL ARMED CONFLICT OR A DOMESTIC DISPUTE?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the key issue. China regards Taiwan as a renegade province and will, therefore, frame the conflict as an internal issue controlled by Chinese domestic law and not subject to foreign interference. The fact that the United States does not recognize Taiwan as an independent country will complicate its argument that blockade actions are improper. Legally, the United States is in a weak position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the United States could employ several legal arguments to justify a range of options available to it to support Taiwan or alleviate the effects of PRC action. The United States could:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Point to the Taiwan Relations Act, which established U.S. policy that reunification had to be voluntary rather than by force, and to the Three Communiqués between the United States and the PRC, which state that the Taiwan issue should be resolved peacefully.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Invoke collective self-defense to maintain international peace and security under the UN Charter (but not by action of the Security Council, since China and likely Russia would veto any unfavorable action).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Argue that the blockade is inhumane and that China must allow certain goods into Taiwan to alleviate civilian suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;HOW IS A BLOCKADE DISTINGUISHED FROM A QUARANTINE, AN EXCLUSION ZONE, AND OTHER ACTIONS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the term “blockade” carries so much legal import, words will be carefully chosen. China will use alternative terms instead, such as “quarantine,” which the United States employed during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis; “inspection process,” driven by public health to prevent another pandemic; or “law enforcement action,” driven by self-defense against a “militarizing” Taiwan. However, these actions have requirements under international law that, if not met, render the action potentially unlawful—thereby presenting opportunities to assist Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Commander’s Handbook on the Law of Naval Warfare (NWP 1-14M) differentiates between blockade and quarantine, specifically regarding the 1962 quarantine, stating, “Quarantine is selective in proportional response to the perceived threat. Blockade requires impartial application to all States—discrimination by a blockading belligerent renders the blockade legally invalid.” In 1962, President Kennedy authorized a limited operation to interdict offensive weapons bound for Cuba. China would likely throw this precedent back at the United States. The United States might respond that these were nuclear weapons and inapplicable to any situation on Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NWP 1-14M provides an additional U.S. response where it notes, “The goal of quarantine is de-escalation and return to the status quo ante or other stabilizing arrangement.” Therefore, if China demands that Taiwan make extreme concessions in exchange for lifting the “quarantine” and those concessions go beyond this limited framework, then the PRC action would not constitute a lawful quarantine. Extreme concessions would include ones that compromise Taiwan’s political autonomy, system of government, or defensive capabilities. Another example would be a broad PRC “quarantine” that prohibits the importation of food and medical necessities, and perhaps even defensive weaponry, which would also go beyond the scope of a lawful quarantine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exclusion zones and similar areas do not afford belligerents unlimited action within them. The Commander’s Handbook illustrates this point well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The total exclusion zone announced by the United Kingdom and Argentine declaration of the South Atlantic as a war zone during the Falklands/Malvinas conflict were problematic in that they deemed any neutral vessel within the zones without permission as hostile and liable to attack. The zones declared by both Iran and Iraq during the 1980s Gulf War appeared to unlawfully operate as free-fire zones for all vessels entering therein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the United States and others might have grounds to challenge China’s declared “exclusion zone.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;WHAT CAN THIRD PARTIES DO TO COUNTER A BLOCKADE AND WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most historical precedents—be it the American Civil War, the Cuban Missile Crisis, World Wars I and II, the Tanker War, the Falklands War, the Korean War, or the Vietnam War (sealing Haiphong harbor)—the pertinent question was how other states reacted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The obvious first step is a diplomatic protest. As Wolff Heintschel von Heinegg observed regarding reactions to blockades, “The usual reaction will be an official protest of the blockading power addressed to the government of the respective neutral State.” Countries that are unwilling to take forceful action might be willing to join such a diplomatic effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Defense Department’s Law of War Manual provides a broad overview of possible avenues for addressing violations of international law. These include national and international investigations and prosecutions, demand for compensation, retorsion (unfriendly conduct that is not inconsistent with international obligations and is done in response to an internationally wrongful act), reprisals (acts that would otherwise be unlawful), prize court adjudications, publication of facts to influence public opinion, and solicitation of intervention by neutral states, and other avenues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States could take more active measures, though these measures carry the risk of confrontation and violence. For example, it could argue that China’s action is invalid for the reasons specified earlier and send ships (or inspire other states to send ships) with humanitarian supplies to alleviate suffering in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States could argue that it was taking measures to protect U.S. and other foreign nationals in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If China remains immune to pressure, the United States could, as a last resort, threaten to recognize Taiwan’s statehood and bring the conflict more clearly into the realm of international law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;WHAT PROTECTIONS APPLY TO THE TAIWAN STRAIT?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the terms that China uses for a blockade, the Taiwan Strait is an international strait, which denotes a special status in international law. As von Heinegg points out, “A blockade may not be established and maintained in, and over, international straits or archipelagic sea lanes unless the blockading power provides for safe and free passage of international navigation and aviation not destined to the blockaded area.” This prohibition would apply even if the conflict were considered an internal matter. Thus, if China denies access to the straits or mines the strait, it would be susceptible to intervention, even with a paralyzed UN Security Council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-context-and-global-impact&quot;&gt;Economic Context and Global Impact&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project is scoped to the operational aspects of a Chinese blockade and its immediate impact on Taiwan’s material position; it does not model the wider economic or political impact of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, it is possible to summarize a growing body of literature on that topic, which provides important context for such a conflict. Considering the possible long duration of such a campaign and its inherently economic nature, the literature highlights the pressures that would be brought to bear on the respective actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BACKGROUND: THE SCALE OF IMPACT DIFFERS FROM THE WAR IN UKRAINE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scale of the economies involved is critical to appreciating the economic impact of conflict. Here, a comparison to Russia’s Ukraine invasion is instructive. At $18.8 trillion in 2024, China’s GDP is roughly eight times that of Russia ($2.4 trillion). Similarly, at $793 billion, Taiwan’s economy is four times the size of Ukraine’s ($180 billion in 2024, $200 billion in 2021). (All figures cited in this section are in market exchange rates.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The degree and nature of integration with the global economy are as important as economic size. The export of primary goods powers the Russian and Ukrainian economies. Russia’s largest export sectors are metals and minerals (60 percent) and agriculture (10 percent), while Ukraine’s are food (40 percent) and metals (12 percent). Losing output drives up global prices but does not fundamentally disrupt global economic activity. China and Taiwan, on the other hand, are deeply embedded in global supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subcomponents often cross borders multiple times before being incorporated into final products. Several of China’s largest export sectors also account for much of its imports. For example, electronics account for 23 percent of China’s exports and 13 percent of its imports, while machinery comprises 18 percent of exports and 8 percent of imports. Incoming and outgoing foreign direct investment is also concentrated in these sectors. War in Asia would sever these supply chains and halt output. Finding and retooling alternative suppliers would take significant time. The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company manufactures more than 60 percent of the world’s contract semiconductors and more than 90 percent of all advanced chips (primarily 3-nanometer chips). These chips are embedded in a wide range of products, from smartphones to cars and appliances, and producing comparable fabs elsewhere could take a decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MAJOR VARIABLES: NATURE, INTENSITY, AND DURATION OF CONFLICT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The global GDP loss from the war in Ukraine has been estimated at between 0.7 percent and 1.5 percent since 2022. Analysts suggest that a better point of comparison for war in Asia would be the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic (estimated at 8.5 percent through 2022). Some estimates of Taiwan scenarios range significantly higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specific estimates depend on the imagined conflict’s nature, intensity, and duration. At the low (or contained) end, the Rhodium Group assessed the impact of a Chinese blockade of Taiwan that did not escalate to the lethal use of military force. The authors estimated that losses over a single year would be $2 trillion, or about 2 percent of global GDP. Two papers by Bloomberg estimate losses in two scenarios. The first posits that China blockades Taiwan, and the United States, rather than using military force, imposes sanctions in response. The authors assess that losses to the global economy would total $5 trillion over one year (or roughly 4 percent of GDP). In the second scenario, China launches an (unspecified) attack on Taiwan, the United States intervenes militarily, and the United States and its allies impose sanctions. In this case, they conclude that losses could total $10 trillion per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2016 study by the RAND Corporation examined different war scenarios defined by the war’s severity (mild or severe) and the duration of conflict (weeks to a year). Although the RAND team did not offer an assessment of aggregate world GDP losses, its estimate of losses to the U.S. and Chinese economies in a severe and long war were about 50 percent higher than the estimates provided for those countries under Bloomberg’s “war” scenario. Thus, global losses might be as high as 15 percent of world GDP annually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;UNEVEN IMPACT ON ACTORS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent studies cited above agree that the distribution of economic costs would be uneven. Taiwan is the most vulnerable, as its commerce with the outside world could be almost entirely severed (a proposition the current study evaluates). The Bloomberg studies conclude that losses to the Taiwanese economy would be 12 percent of GDP in the non-kinetic scenario and 40 percent in the kinetic scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the United States were to support Taiwan and intervene in the conflict, China would likely suffer losses second only to Taiwan and several times those suffered by the United States, according to recent assessments. War would decouple China from some of its most important economic partners, starting with Taiwan. The United States could orchestrate sanctions, making it difficult for Chinese firms to operate overseas. Foreign-invested enterprises, which account for 25 percent of China’s high-tech exports, would likely be unable to continue operations. Trade to some of China’s most important ports could be disrupted in a kinetic conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts also concur that other Asian economies—including U.S. allies—would suffer damage almost as severe as China. As a percentage of total trade, South Korea does twice as much trade with China as the United States does, while Australia does almost three times as much. Supply chains for Japanese and especially South Korean firms are deeply embedded in China. Australia’s economy relies so heavily on Chinese markets that finding substitutes on the same scale might be impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the U.S. economy is less exposed to disruptions emanating from an Asian conflict, it would still suffer substantial damage. The available analyses suggest it could sustain losses of up to 5 to 10 percent of total GDP in a kinetic conflict lasting one year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CAVEATS AND NON-GDP EFFECTS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most macroeconomic models are primarily demand driven and therefore are not well-suited to modeling disruptions in supply. In part for that reason, authors of the Rhodium study emphasize that their estimates represent a “floor.” The “full scope of imperiled activity,” they assert, “would surely be greater” and would “materialize almost immediately.” Indeed, many economists emphasize the possibility that second-order effects could be significant. Christopher Neely, a senior economic policy adviser at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, argues that a conflict over Taiwan might imperil foreign (non-Chinese) banks. UK banks are particularly exposed, with 19 percent of total global exposure to Chinese overseas debt.&lt;/p&gt;

Garafola, and David C. Gompert, War with China: Thinking Through the Unthinkable (Santa Monica, CA: RAND Corporation, 2016)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One likely result of conflict would be a “flight to safety” by investors, which might drive down stocks but buttress the dollar and lower U.S. bond yields. As one former Bank of Japan official observed, however, a flight to safety would see money fleeing countries with preexisting financial conditions. Greece, he observed, was driven into a financial corner (and ultimate default, with enormous political consequences) by investors’ flight to safety during the 2007–08 global financial crisis. Countries far from Asia could be tipped into insolvency by a war over Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electoral mechanisms make democratic states sensitive to economic feedback, especially during election years. Western business leaders and consumers might demand an off-ramp if conflict tanked markets and spiked inflation. To the extent that the United States attempted to discipline and orchestrate a unified allied reaction to the blockade, Washington could be subject to dual domestic and foreign pressures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before embarking on a blockade, Beijing would have modeled the potential economic effects, and it would not launch the operation unless it were willing to bear a high level of economic hardship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as the popular reaction against draconian zero-Covid policies showed, the Chinese public does not always follow the government’s script. The scars of Tiananmen, when the Chinese Communist Party’s authority was openly challenged, still show in the state’s sensitivity to any signs of emergent social organization tied to dissent. In this context, the dislocation of the blockade and the consequent upsurge in unemployment could cause pressure for de-escalation that might match the pressure faced by the United States. With a tight lid on free expression, such pressure likely would not manifest itself to the outside world until it had reached dangerous levels. However, the government would measure each pascal of rising social pressure with mounting concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-framework-for-analyzing-blockade&quot;&gt;A Framework for Analyzing Blockade&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter begins with the scope conditions that define what this framework does and does not analyze. Next, it posits a framework for analyzing blockade scenarios based on the escalation levels of China on one side and the opposing coalition on the other. It details those escalation levels and how they combine to produce scenarios in a matrix covering aspects from non-kinetic boarding and seizure to a conflict with all conventional capabilities available. It then investigates a number of variants within the escalation pairings to conduct a sensitivity analysis on how critical but uncertain factors might influence the campaign’s outcome and how certain policies might improve Taiwan’s situation if enacted before the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scope-conditions&quot;&gt;Scope Conditions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study focuses on the military conduct of a blockade and its consequences for Taiwan’s economy. It does not include other issues critical to a complete understanding of a blockade and its consequences. Therefore, a full description of these scoping conditions is needed to set out what the study does and does not do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Blockade of the main island of Taiwan. For analytic purposes, the project assumes that China has decided to institute a blockade of the main island of Taiwan (and not just some outlying islands). The Chinese government could reach such a decision for various reasons related to domestic politics, faulty intelligence, inaccurate military assessments, and international pressure. As noted in Chapter 1, this assumption does not mean that a blockade is inevitable, only that it is plausible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Noneconomic tools employed. China could harm Taiwan’s economy with purely economic means. Beyond ceasing cross-strait trade, China could sanction companies that do business with Taiwan. Taiwan would then have to find shippers willing to forego trade with China, while major shippers would likely reconfigure their supply lines to transship goods through non-Taiwanese ports. However, the dynamics and effects of such a purely economic “blockade” below the threshold of direct action are beyond the scope of this report. Several other CSIS reports have covered this topic. Conversely, the United States and other countries could respond to any Chinese action with sanctions or other economic tools. As this report focuses only on the economic impacts to Taiwan, these economic tools are not analyzed (for a review of the possible impacts of these economic tools, see the section in Chapter 2 on Economic Context and Global Impact).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Focus on blockade events. The reaction of the world to a Chinese blockade would be shaped by the legal arguments that would be made and the diplomatic, political, and economic pressures that would pertain. Recognizing that the global reactions can not be predicted, this project uses scenario variants to explore alternative assumptions about them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No nuclear escalation. The project examines conventional conflict only. Nuclear operations are unlikely in most blockade scenarios since the level of violence is low. Although it becomes possible at higher levels of violence since both major combatants are nuclear armed, it is plausible that concerns about escalation would keep the conflict at a conventional level. Readers interested in the implications of nuclear escalation are welcome to read the project team’s previous report, Confronting Armageddon: Wargaming Nuclear Deterrence and Its Failures in a U.S.-China Conflict over Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taiwan resists. This set of wargames, like the previous sets, assumes Taiwanese resistance. If Taiwan capitulates, even partially, the United States and its coalition will not contest a blockade either. They will only fight for what Taiwan is willing to fight for. However, a recent CSIS study noted how “vexing” it was to estimate Taiwanese willingness to resist, given the inconclusiveness of the data. This is not to devalue resilience, which would be critical to Taiwan’s survival. On the contrary, the policy recommendations in this report—coupled with what Taiwan has already done—would directly contribute to increasing the material basis for continued Taiwanese resistance. However, this report does not cover recommendations about information operations needed to make continued Taiwanese resistance more likely.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Effects of counterblockade not analyzed. The analysis does not examine the effects of a counter-blockade against China. U.S. and coalition actions to blunt a blockade of Taiwan could easily become a counter-blockade against Chinese maritime trade. The result would squeeze the Chinese economy (and the world economy).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In all scenarios examined here, China would suffer significant economic damage from the interruption of trade with the global economy and a possible U.S. counter-blockade. However, deciding whether China would cease its blockade because of damage to its economy would depend on a myriad of factors, mostly unknowable but, in any case, not covered in this report. See the victory conditions in Chapter 5 for a discussion of national endurance and the literature review in the previous chapter for a discussion of the wider economic effects of a blockade.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Although the project does not forecast “surrender/back off” decisions, the foundational research on blockades does inform readers about how and under what circumstances countries have made these decisions in the past. Thus, readers are positioned to draw their own conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not a recommendation about U.S. Taiwan policy. The project does not argue for or against any U.S. policy regarding commitment to the defense of Taiwan. That requires a broad discussion of U.S. foreign policy objectives in the Pacific, the political sustainability of such objectives, and how such objectives fit into a global strategy. The project proposes actions that the United States and its partners could take if they want to be more successful in countering a blockade, but such proposals do not constitute a recommendation regarding broader policy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No use of classified data. As with the First Battle and Confronting Armageddon reports, this project uses only unclassified data so that its products can be disseminated widely and without restraint. It can then inform public debate.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In some ways, reliance on unclassified data is not a major limitation. Unclassified information is more detailed and accurate than ever before, and much previously classified information is now available from open sources. For example, The Military Balance by the International Institute for Strategic Studies provides detailed equipment numbers, and Janes’s databases contain detailed information about equipment capabilities. Google Earth provides imagery that only highly classified systems provided in the past. A vast trove of economic and shipping data is available online, as shown in the report’s footnotes. Classified data is undoubtedly superior to unclassified data for some elements of weapons effects. However, in most other areas (particularly the shipping data that is most relevant to blockades), unclassified data is comparable in quality.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scenarios&quot;&gt;Scenarios&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A blockade could take many forms depending on the political risk accepted by both sides and the military tools they choose to employ. All of the scenarios here begin with China establishing a maritime exclusion zone, although the means by which China enforces this exclusion zone—and the response that Taiwan and other countries take—varies widely. A “blockade” of Taiwan could range widely, from boarding by the China Coast Guard while Taiwan is constrained and the United States is uninvolved to an unrestricted conventional war between China and a coalition including the United States, Taiwan, and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For consistency, all scenarios are assumed to start with a common backstory: Tensions between the United States and China increase, with a focus on Taiwan. China seeks to resolve (or at least improve) its Taiwan problem through a blockade. It issues a notice to mariners that establishes an exclusion zone where ships are subject to search, seizure, and attack if the PRC deems them noncompliant. Major international shippers subsequently halt most traffic through the exclusion zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following that common backstory, scenarios diverge based on the escalation levels taken by China and the opposing coalition. Although there are an infinite number of gradations, the project categorizes them into four levels for each side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CHINESE ESCALATION LEVELS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s four escalation levels are summarized below. (More complete descriptions are found in Appendix E, forthcoming.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Boarding: The China Coast Guard (CCG), Maritime Security Administration (MSA), and People’s Armed Forces Maritime Militia (PAFMM) attempt to board and seize merchant traffic to Taiwan without opening fire (visit, board, search, and seizure, or VBSS, in maritime parlance). Many merchant ships would comply and heave to, allowing even much smaller ships in the PAFMM to board and escort the seized merchant to the mainland. For ships that do not comply, CCG or MSA teams would use helicopters to land on merchant ships, which are much larger than even the largest former People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) ships in the CCG. All these boardings occur outside of Taiwanese and Japanese territorial waters but within the contours of the “10-dash line.” Cross-strait trade continues as normal, as PRC officials deem that traffic to conform with the inspection regime.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Submarines and Mines: The PLAN employs submarines launching torpedoes, the PAFMM, and submarine-laid mines to interdict merchant traffic to Taiwan outside of Taiwan’s territorial waters. All of these actions occur outside of Taiwanese and Japanese territorial waters but within the contours of the exclusion zone (within international waters). The PRC allows cross-strait trade to continue, but it decreases in proportion to overall traffic reductions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Offshore Kinetic: China now employs overt force against merchants and escorts outside of Taiwan’s territorial waters but within the exclusion zone. Although ships would be the most likely targets, the attackers would largely not be surface ships of the PLAN but rather ground-and air-launched antiship missiles. Only select elements of cross-strait trade would continue (due to both the PRC’s increased willingness to escalate and Taiwan’s reluctance to permit continued trade under these conditions).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wider War: The PLA uses overt force not only in the exclusion zone but also against Taiwan itself, the United States, and Japan. Against Taiwan, these munitions could target ships in port, port infrastructure, and the energy grid (particularly power plants). At this point, cross-strait trade will cease.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;COALITION ESCALATION LEVELS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second variable used to categorize scenarios is the coalition escalation level, focusing on the United States and Taiwan, which is similarly broken down into four levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taiwan Constrained: Taiwan restricts its military forces to its own territorial waters and contiguous zone. In one variant, Taiwan’s Coast Guard Administration (CGA) can go into international waters to escort merchants and deter boardings, though it is outmatched by the larger, better-armed, and more numerous CCG. No other country is involved.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taiwan Assertive: Taiwan allows its military to intervene against any Chinese forces that have attacked or attempted to board merchant ships within the exclusion zone. If China is boarding merchant ships, the Republic of China Navy (ROCN) and the Republic of China Air Force (ROCAF) can directly attack the boarders. Although the PLA is much stronger than the Taiwanese military, the Taiwanese military is more capable than the PAFMM and even the ex-PLAN ships in the CCG. This is true even if Taiwan restricts itself to attacking only Chinese ships that have attacked merchants. Against submarines and minelayers, the sides are more evenly matched. Against a PLA engaging in direct combat operations, the Taiwanese military would benefit from operating from sanctuary in scenarios where the PLA is not attacking Taiwan itself. However, the ROCAF and ROCN would be outmatched by the PLA’s modern and voluminous hardware. Again, no other country is involved.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;U.S. Constrained: The United States is now involved. The United States aids an assertive Taiwan with forces able to engage in direct combat with the PLA within the declared exclusion zone. However, the United States does not attack Chinese forces outside the exclusion zone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wider War: The United States can attack PLA forces outside the exclusion zones, including on the Chinese mainland.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combining the Chinese and U.S./Taiwan escalation ladders produces a matrix that broadly describes a range of plausible scenarios ranging from an attempt by China to impose a customs regime on a constrained Taiwan using boarding only, all the way up to a war between China and a U.S.-led coalition using all conventional means at their disposal. For convenience, the project references the table in numeric format, the first digit being China’s escalation level and the second being the United States and Taiwan’s level. Thus, for example, a “2x2” scenario is the PRC using submarines and mines against an assertive Taiwan without any U.S. aid. A “dyad” is a cell in the matrix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these scenarios deserve more scrutiny than others. First, some are uninteresting because of the force mismatch: No one could doubt that a China willing to embark on a wider war against a constrained Taiwan could completely cut off imports to Taiwan (cell 4x1); conversely, even constrained kinetic action by the United States could defeat the weakly armed CCG (cell 1x3). Second, cells where escalation levels are roughly matched (1x1, 2x2, 3x3, 4x4) are more interesting than others because it seems likely that the results are more sensitive to assumptions; for example, changing the number of ships available to Taiwan probably would not change the outcome of a “China Wider War–Taiwan Constrained” dyad (1x4), but more ships could plausibly shift the balance in an “Offshore Kinetic–U.S. Constrained” dyad (3x3). Therefore, the analysis avoids investigating uninteresting scenarios and focuses attention on this diagonal and cells adjacent to it, as highlighted in Figure 3.2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it is impossible to cover every permutation of every variable, some should be analyzed to examine the sensitivity of results to the most important variations. The following section explains this report’s approach to sensitivity analysis within individual scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;VARIANTS FOR SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sensitivity analysis is a key element of campaign analysis because it allows researchers to address the uncertainty of key inputs to ensure a full range of outcomes. This is true for both strict modeling exercises and wargames. The escalation levels described above cover major elements of sensitivity analysis, but within each dyad, alternative yet plausible assumptions could affect outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is an overview of the variants—variants being the changes to “Base” assumptions. The appropriate module descriptions and forthcoming appendices contain details about the derivation of “Base” and variant conditions. These variants are explored in dyads of interest, particularly those diagonal dyads with roughly matched escalation levels. Note that not all variants are explored in all diagonals. “Base” assumptions represent the most likely circumstances and are used in all iterations, unless specified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Variant 1: Taiwan’s Coast Guard Administration rules of engagement (ROE)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This variant examines how changes in the CGA rules of engagement could increase the effectiveness of an otherwise constrained Taiwan. It therefore only applies to the China Boarding–Taiwan Constrained dyad (1x1).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Extent of CGA engagement:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Base: The CGA remains in territorial waters.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;CGA Active: The CGA escorts incoming merchants and opens fire on any Chinese ship that attempts to seize merchants.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Variant 2: Pre-war preparations&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;To test the efficacy of several pre-blockade measures that research suggests would improve outcomes, the “Prepared” variant assumes that the following policy recommendations (see Chapter 6) relating to preparing the maritime fleet have been implemented.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s ability to requisition ships:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Base: Taiwan is limited to Taiwanese-flagged vessels.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prepared: Taiwan’s access is extended to 75 percent of Taiwanese-owned vessels.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s ability to purchase ships:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Base: Taiwan purchases the ships most readily available on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prepared: Taiwan can purchase the most capable ships (subject to crew availability).&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;LNG tankers available to Taiwan and the United States:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Base: There are two Taiwanese-owned and Taiwanese-flagged LNG tankers available in 2028.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prepared: The U.S. Maritime Administration (MARAD) and Taiwan have each brought five additional LNG tankers under contract for national emergencies. These tankers appear in weeks 4 and 10.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The responsiveness of Taiwanese seafarers:&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prepared: Ninety percent of Taiwanese seafarers are willing.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Base: Ten percent of foreign seafarers on Taiwanese-owned ships are willing to continue crewing blockade-running ships.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prepared: Twenty-five percent of foreign seafarers are contracted to continue working on Taiwanese ships running the blockade.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The ability of Taiwan to hire foreign seafarers:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Base: Taiwan is able to quadruple its peacetime hiring rate over two months.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prepared: Taiwan is able to octuple its peacetime hiring rate over one month.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s pre-crisis purchases of coal and LNG.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Base: No pre-crisis purchases occur.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prepared: The Taiwanese government sees a crisis developing and pushes industry to purchase an additional two weeks of energy inventories.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s ability to dictate resource distribution:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Base: Taiwan faces uneven rationing and allocation, prewar allocations continue, and the population feels austerity earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prepared: Taiwan establishes and publicized emergency rationing and allocation plans, allowing for a smooth transition to rationing and allocation.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Variant 3: Japan’s participation&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The invasion project identified Japanese concurrence in using U.S. bases in Japan as essential for U.S. denial of a Chinese victory. A similar test of the necessity of Japanese cooperation is needed for this project.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Level of Japan’s participation:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Base: Japan allows transshipment in its ports and the United States to conduct combat operations from its bases in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Japan Out: Japan does not participate in the coalition, allowing neither the transshipment of goods through its territory nor U.S. combat operations from bases in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Variant 4: Chinese antiship missile capabilities&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The game rules limit the ability of both sides to coordinate force packages in the time steps played, and they assume that antimissile countermeasures are relatively effective. Because some limits might have a large impact on the outcome of convoys attacks, the project explores the impact if those assumptions were more favorable for China.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Salvo sizes:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Base: China may employ up to 8 salvos (200 missiles) against a convoy during the final (five-hour) phase of movement to Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Enhanced Chinese Missiles: China may employ up to 16 salvos (400 missiles) against a convoy during the final phase.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Impact of passive seekers:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Base: Both sides’ passive missile seekers automatically target the desired ship in a group 33 percent of the time (with remainder randomly distributed).&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Enhanced Chinese Missiles: China’s passive missile seekers automatically target the desired ship 66 percent of the time (remainder randomly distributed).&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Enhanced and flexible command and control:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Base: Both sides declare and then execute all attacks in a turn.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Enhanced Chinese Missiles: China can execute part of its attacks against convoys then select weapons or systems for subsequent attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Variant 5: Hardness of Taiwan’s electrical infrastructure&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;At the highest Chinese escalation level, China teams were able to bombard Taiwanese infrastructure. If China could destroy Taiwanese energy infrastructure (either by attacking power plants or transformers), then it would not matter if the coalition were able to get coal, oil, and LNG to Taiwan. The effectiveness of potential Taiwanese hardening of its electrical infrastructure therefore needed to be investigated.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The resilience of Taiwan’s energy infrastructure:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Base: Every ton of bombs dropped reduces electrical capacity by 8.2 megawatts (MW). Every week, Taiwan can restore 3 percent of total capacity, or 1,738 MW.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hardened: The hardening of electricity production, expansion of dual-fired capacity, and increase in repair capabilities means that every ton of bombs only destroys 4.1 MW and that each week Taiwan can restore 6 percent of total capacity, or 3,476 MW.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Variant 6: Provision of “Ukrainian-style” aid&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In most iterations of coalition escalation level one and two, the United States is not involved at all. Coalition escalation level three introduces U.S. combat forces. There is therefore a middle ground of equipment aid, similar to what has been supplied to Ukraine, that needs to be investigated.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Provision of Ukrainian-style aid:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Base: No U.S. involvement in scenarios with coalition escalation level one or two&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ukrainian-Style Aid: The United States provides munitions to Taiwan while continuing to withhold direct combat forces.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DYADS AS ANALYTIC AND NOT PREDICTIVE TOOLS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the scenarios posited by these dyads, it is unlikely that a blockade in the real world would be locked into one escalation dyad and continue indefinitely there. There would be escalations and (hopefully) de-escalations. Thus, these dyads are tools for analysis and not predictions about how entire campaigns would play out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A plausible course of events through the scenarios is that China begins with boarding. While initially constrained, Taiwan sees that to be successful it has to adopt a more assertive stance and begins using military force against the Chinese CCG, MSA, and PAFMM. In response, China initiates a submarine and mining campaign against Taiwan, leading to constrained U.S. action, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is analytically necessary to examine each dyad because it is not immediately clear what the results of combat would be. Even less clear is how sensitive those results are to different assumptions. Wargaming these dyads and their variants provides a baseline for understanding the outcome if countries remained at these dyads and provides insight into the escalatory pressures that would exist. Analyzing how both sides might react to those escalatory pressures requires a different approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;free-play-to-observe-escalation&quot;&gt;Free Play to Observe Escalation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better understand these transitions and off-ramps, the project conducted five free-play iterations in addition to these structured scenarios to see how players approached the problem when there were no constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these iterations, the China team was told to reunite Taiwan at the lowest possible cost to Chinese forces and the Taiwanese economy. The U.S., Taiwan, and Japan teams were told to maintain Taiwan’s political status quo with the fewest friendly losses and least damage to the Taiwanese economy. These iterations gave insights into escalation dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next chapter describes the modules used to adjudicate the scenarios, whether fixed dyads or free play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wargaming-a-blockade&quot;&gt;Wargaming a Blockade&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter describes the modules—bundles of models—used to adjudicate the scenarios, whether fixed dyads or free play. They provide rigorous rule sets for analyzing the three central questions of the blockade problem examined in the wargames: (1) What merchant ships are available for transit to Taiwan? (2) How much cargo gets through to Taiwan? (3) What is the material effect of the arriving cargo on Taiwan?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within each module, choices are available to players, and the results of those choices are adjudicated according to established rules. These rules are either deterministic (e.g., each U.S. F-15 can carry and launch two JASSM missiles) or probabilistic (e.g., a particular type of missile has a 60 percent probability of striking its intended target). All rules are based on operations research conducted by the team. In some cases, this modeling and the resulting rules are relevant to all scenarios, while some rules are relevant only to a subset of scenarios. All models assume a conflict date of 2028.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;module-1-what-merchant-ships-are-available-for-transit-to-taiwan&quot;&gt;Module 1: What Merchant Ships Are Available for Transit to Taiwan?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Module 1 first characterizes ships’ cargo capacity and the type of cargo that ships can carry—tankers for oil, specialized vessels for liquified gas, or containerized or bulk carriers for goods ranging from food to semiconductor manufacturing materials. These determine the goods that reach Taiwan to sustain its economy (more on this in Module 3). The module includes the timeline for when these ships can arrive in Japanese ports to load up, which is affected by their day-to-day location and readiness status. In all scenarios, merchant ships that would typically go directly to Taiwan instead stop in Japanese ports because they would be unwilling to take the risk of a direct journey. Their goods are transferred onto the ships that are available for shuttle duty in Japanese ports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE BREAKDOWN OF NORMAL COMMERCE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Chinese blockade of Taiwan, in whatever form, would cause all commercial traffic to Taiwan to stop. The shipping experts interviewed in researching this topic were unanimous in saying that commercial shipping lines would comply with notices to mariners issued by China. Furthermore, almost all shipping charters contain a “Five Powers War Risk Exclusion” clause that automatically terminates maritime insurance in affected areas in case of hostilities between any of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conflict—with the prospect of ships being detained, impounded, sunk, or otherwise taken out of circulation—produces a large increase in hull insurance and cargo insurance. Shipping insurance often rapidly adjusts premiums to account for conflict and allow commerce to resume. War risk insurance covers losses associated with a variety of military scenarios as detailed in the specific policy. Although such coverage is highly customizable, it typically excludes losses to major power wars and travel into restricted areas. States frequently have to either provide insurance themselves or put their credit toward insurance underwriters. Even in war zones covered by commercial insurance, rates often exceed actual shipping losses several times over. Thus, a war zone through which 1 percent of shipping traffic is lost will produce hull insurance of 3–4 percent. The inference is that, although an insurance scheme might work when attrition is in the low single digits, it theoretically cannot work at attrition rates higher than 25 percent. In practice, this breaks down in the upper single digits of attrition rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the initial shock of a blockade leading straight toward an assessment of double-digit attrition rates of merchants bound toward Taiwan, coalition governments will have to operate all ships bound for Taiwan during a blockade. States subject to blockade find it more reliable, cheaper, and more efficient to create a nationally controlled fleet, for which the state either provides insurance directly or finds other means to underwrite and subsidize commercial insurance. These states will often also reflag ships to their own country as part of a national insurance and subsidy operation. However, although these ships are willing to sail to Taiwan, they are relatively few in number compared to the tonnage needs to bring goods (particularly energy) from around the globe to Taiwan. Thus, the government-owned fleets often simply function as a shuttle to bring goods through the final danger to the blockaded area. This drives the need for a transshipment port.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TRANSSHIPMENT SHUTTLES: REGIONAL OPTIONS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As illustrated by prior historical examples, Taiwan will require regional transshipment to run shuttles during the blockade. Numerous allies could play a role in running shuttle convoys, though their practicality and advantages vary considerably. Japan and Guam constitute Taiwan’s two leading transshipment stronghold options, with Japan offering far greater capacity. Other states and ports could play a supporting role in facilitating shuttling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tokyo’s acquiescence or facilitation of transshipment points in Japan would greatly ease the burden on a dedicated shuttle fleet operated or contracted and insured by Taiwan. A one-way transit to, say, Los Angeles, California (6,110 nm), might require 15–16 days, while the transit to Osaka (1,000 nm) could be completed in 3–4 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One must consider whether Japanese ports can handle the cargo load from ships carrying goods for Taiwan. Japan has around 120 ports that cumulatively have the capacity to load approximately 1,480,496 tons of cargo, 6,849 barrels per day of crude oil, and 663,013,000 kg of LNG a day. Measurements of port throughput do not necessarily correspond to the physical capacity of the ports themselves, as they are affected by economic factors. Developments in faraway facilities, for example, depress the amount of cargo—as was the case in 2021 with the global depression of normal port operations due to obstruction of the Suez Canal by a Japanese-owned, Taiwanese-chartered, and Panamanian-flagged container ship. While loading blockade-running ships and prioritizing these vessels will inevitably disrupt normal commercial operations, the global economic downturn caused by this conflict (and the consequent freeing of port capacity) would facilitate the shuttle operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A comparison to Guam reveals a stark capacity differential: Japan’s annual port container throughput exceeds Guam’s by a factor of 254. Japan is better equipped to transship cargo to Taiwan than to Guam. For example, Japan has 40 LNG terminals and five oil ports, which is a drastic contrast to Guam’s lack of a functioning LNG terminal and singular access point for petroleum. If Japan were unavailable for this effort, Guam likely could not handle the intake of Taiwanese shipping. Other countries such as Australia and Singapore would need to supplement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly, ports in other countries might serve this purpose. Indeed, shuttling from other locations might become necessary if Japan either is deterred from cooperating or is drawn into the conflict and its ports become targets. However, other locations would either increase transit times or require the use of less-developed infrastructure than Japanese ports. Some ports, such as Singapore and Sydney, would be several times as far, while others, such as Apra Harbor, lack the same scale (see Appendix B, Table B.3: Potential Regional Transshipment Shuttling Ports, forthcoming). Since Japan would continue its normal imports and exports, slack or idle capacity would be more important than total capacity. However, given the scale of Japanese ports, they would likely be able to accommodate a large influx of Taiwanese shipping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SHIP AVAILABILITY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and Taiwan have a number of ships that they can use to run a blockade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Taiwanese Ships&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan can initially draw from the extensive commercial fleet owned and flagged by Taiwanese shipping companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s All-out Defense Mobilization Readiness Act provides for the requisition of private property and the coordination of shipping. The bulk of Taiwanese-owned vessels operate under a “flag of convenience.” Thus, although Taiwan owns around 1.3 percent of the world fleet, many fewer ships are flagged to Taiwan. Furthermore, there are far fewer Taiwanese-flagged ships than Taiwanese-owned ships (16,220 versus 42,709 deadweight tonnage).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does not appear that Taiwanese-owned but non-flagged ships could be similarly requisitioned. However, the process of re-registering a vessel is quick and easy. Reflagging for national security objectives is not without precedent. During the Iran-Iraq War, the Kuwaiti government responded to the threat of Iranian attacks on its vessels by requesting that 11 of its tankers be reflagged under the U.S. flag. This meant the tankers were entitled to U.S. naval protection and were escorted by U.S. warships as they transited the Persian Gulf. After the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the U.S. government encouraged the transfer of ships from the U.S. flag to the Panamanian flag to circumvent the Neutrality Act to supply future U.S. allies in the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the flag of a vessel indicates the nationality of the ship and is thus governed by that country’s laws. As such, shipowners typically choose to register their vessels with countries that impose the least financial (labor and tax regulations) and administrative burdens. In accordance with international law, the state has jurisdiction and control over vessels that fly its flag but not the vessels whose beneficial owners are citizens of the state. The consensus from a CSIS working group of shipping experts was that Taiwan could only expect vessels flagged to Taiwan to be available for requisitioning into shuttle service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “Base” case estimated that only Taiwanese-flagged ships could be requisitioned; for sensitivity, the scenarios included a variant (“Prepared”) where Taiwan has prepared for this contingency by ensuring that 75 percent of Taiwanese-owned ships (regardless of the flag) can be requisitioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Prepared scenario, Taiwan has taken legal measures to ensure that Taiwanese-owned ships can be requisitioned and reflagged during national emergencies. As mentioned above, the United States was able to put U.S.-owned ships that were Panamanian-flagged under its control during World War II. However, Taiwan’s legal solution to this problem would have to be different. Even if all Taiwanese-owned ships were legally required to answer the call, some proportion would be either unsuitable or unwilling (with the owners selling the ships during the lead-up to the blockade, shifting ownership shares to co-owners, or similarly evading the requisitioning process). In this case, an estimated 75 percent of Taiwanese-owned ships can be taken up by Taiwan, regardless of their flag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether considering just Taiwanese-flagged or all Taiwanese-owned vessels, these ships will arrive on a staggered timeline. A limited number of ships are expected to already be in Japan—either docked and reloading cargo—or in the vicinity. These ships would be available from the first week. A certain number are expected to be in Chinese ports and thus presumed to be impounded by the Chinese government. Taiwanese-owned ships are disproportionately container ships (compared to the global distribution of seagoing vessels). Some will be the first ships to arrive in Japan, while others will arrive several months after the activation started. (See Appendix B, Table B.4: Ship Arrival Times and Taiwanese Requisitioning, forthcoming.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;U.S. Surge Sealift Fleet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States can first draw from government-owned ships provided by the National Defense Reserve Fleet (NDRF). Established shortly after World War II to address prewar merchant ship shortages, the NDRF sought to preserve sealift capability for national security needs. Today’s fleet comprises 75 government-owned, inactive, and partially manned vessels. Of these, 53 are in the Ready Reserve Force (RRF), a subset of the NDRF intended to be activated on a faster timeline. Most RRF ships are roll-on, roll-off vessels, which are well suited for military use and do not require extensive port infrastructure for loading and unloading but have relatively limited cargo capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theoretically, ships in the NDRF and RRF should be able to start arriving in theater for shuttle duty in a matter of weeks. The RRF ships are routinely maintained and are designed to sail within 5–20 days’ notice. RRF ships have been activated and rapidly deployed in the past. Following Hurricane Katrina, five RRF ships were activated on September 3 and arrived in New Orleans between September 12 and 16. Two days after the 2010 Haiti earthquake, the United States activated two RRF ships that arrived within a week. Non-RRF NDRF ships take longer to activate, requiring between 30 and 120 days. Ships in the NDRF and RRF are moored in the coastal waters of the continental United States: along the West Coast, the Gulf of Mexico/America, and the East Coast. Ship speeds vary, which also affects their potential arrivals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are reasons to suspect that activation of the entire surge sealift fleet will result in delays in mobilization in a scenario like the one studied in this report. Recent “turbo activation” drills revealed that only 24 percent of RRF vessels were ready to depart within the designated time frame due to the advanced age of ships and shortages of merchant seafarers. These drills involved partial activation—even the largest only accounted for 28 ships. Table B.5: Availability of U.S. Reserve Fleet Ships in Appendix B (forthcoming) shows the timeline for NDRF and RRF ships arriving in Japan and ready for shuttle service based on the data and analysis above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States can also access a fleet of commercially operated ships. These are enrolled in three programs: the Maritime Security Program (MSP), the Voluntary Intermodal Sealift Agreement (VISA), and the Tanker Security Program (TSP). During national security crises, the U.S. government is assured access to ships enrolled in these programs. The 60 ships comprising the MSP receive an annual stipend and are also part of either the VISA or TSP. Ships enrolled in VISA or TSP do not receive a stipend but are granted priority access to government cargo in peacetime. In return, the U.S. government can activate the VISA program in three stages, requiring participants to allocate increasing portions of their vessel capacity for government use. The cargo capacity allocated to the U.S. government at different stages of VISA activation is detailed below. During the highest stage of VISA activation, the 60 MSP ships must commit 100 percent of their capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The timeline for the activation of these ships and their arrival in the theater can be estimated from historical trends. Prior to activation, these ships—like Taiwanese-owned vessels—perform their commercial duties. Some MSP ships may be fulfilling government contracts to transport cargo and thus be nearer to the continental United States. Others, such as large Maersk container ships participating in VISA, are likely sailing in faraway places. During Operation Iraqi Freedom, the U.S. Military Sealift Command activated 20 VISA-registered ships in addition to the 84 VISA-registered ships used by the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command. Thus, in an optimistic scenario, if the United States is involved, the model can assume that the U.S. government would activate VISA ships operating in the western Pacific in the first weeks of a blockade of Taiwan. These ships would sail to their intended destinations, unload cargo, and then sail to the transshipment port. Ships underway in the rest of the Pacific would be activated next. (See Appendix B, Table B.6: U.S. Commercial Ship Travel Time and Delay, forthcoming, for the estimated arrival timelines of commercial ships available for U.S. government use.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SHIP PURCHASES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a large market of used cargo ships that Taiwan and the United States could purchase to supplement their fleets. With purchases, mobilized shipping can be increased over time. The annual Clarksons report lists 2,401 secondhand ships sold globally in 2022, including 81,494,000 gross tons at a cost of $29.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s purchase of its ghost fleet during the Ukraine war serves as a helpful guide for understanding Taiwanese ship purchasing in a blockade. To evade sanctions and price caps, Russia has purchased hundreds of old crude and oil tankers, which now account for 70 percent of Russian oil transportation and 20 percent of the global crude vessel fleet. Old oil tankers are more attainable and inexpensive, as most insurers and prominent oil companies avoid these older ships. Before Russia’s invasion, ghost fleet ships accounted for only 6 percent of oil tankers flowing in and out of Russian ports, compared to 35 percent in early 2025. Experts at the Kyiv School of Economics estimate that Russia has spent approximately $10 billion on this fleet buildup since 2022. Western European shipping companies are the leading suppliers, with ships from Greece comprising approximately one-third of the fleet. Intermediaries and shell companies facilitated Russian purchases. Russia’s procurement from Western vendors illustrates that the market persists even during heightened geopolitical tensions, particularly for aging ships that are otherwise bound for scrap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, most ships available to purchase are not conducive to Taiwan’s needs. Taiwan would like to purchase larger ships (whose crew-to-tonnage ratio is lower); it would particularly want to purchase LNG ships, which are relatively newer and fewer in number. (The project estimates that only four LNG ships would be destined for scrap in 2028; these would be the easiest to purchase quickly.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Base case, Taiwan purchases merchants each week according to their market availability. In contrast, the Prepared case posits that both Taiwan and MARAD have made contingency contracts to be able to purchase or requisition additional LNG ships. In the Base case, Taiwan is limited to one LNG ship per week. In the Prepared case, both Taiwan and MARAD have each bought (or contracted for) five LNG ships each that appear in weeks 4 and 10, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CREWING&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While buying and insuring ships are purely commercial transactions, getting seafarers to operate the ships involves a human dimension. To what extent will they be willing to enter danger zones? At one level, the answer has long been known, as merchant ships have routinely sailed the oceans during wartime and sometimes taken heavy losses. The Battle of the Atlantic during World War II is well known for this, although just as harrowing was the experience of civilian Italian crews making the dangerous crossing to North Africa or Japanese crews trying to keep the extracted goods from the “Southern Resource Area” as U.S. submarines became increasingly effective. Even if seafarers are willing, there simply might not be enough of them: During World War II, U.S. ships were frequently delayed from launching due to a lack of crews, particularly of specialized ratings. While the United States has a system for crew and ship mobilization with VISA, this is not the case for Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis begins with a look at the numbers and composition of the existing crews on Taiwanese ships. First, the authors assume that almost all seafarers on Taiwanese-owned ships (not just Taiwanese-flagged ships) are Taiwanese. However, the crews of Taiwanese-owned ships are not all Taiwanese. In 2021, there were 1.9 million seafarers in the world. As Taiwan owns 1.3 percent of the world fleet, this implies that there are around 24,632 seafarers on Taiwanese-owned vessels. As there were also 8,268 Taiwanese seafarers in 2021, if Taiwanese seafarers are only on Taiwanese-owned ships, this would imply that about one-third of the crew members on Taiwanese-owned vessels are Taiwanese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Base case assumes that 50 percent of Taiwanese and 10 percent of foreign seafarers from Taiwanese-owned ships remain and are available. This estimate, like any estimate of individual willingness to fight during wartime, is highly subjective. Prewar polling indicated that 52 percent of Ukrainians said that they were willing to “fight for their country with arms in their hands,” but that number jumped to 75 percent following Russia’s invasion. Foreign seafarers lack any nationalistic motivations, but this could to some extent be compensated for with higher pay. There was a 25 percent desertion rate per port visit for foreign seafarers on British ships during World War II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prepared case assumes Taiwan has mandated that its seafarers be prepared to serve the country in time of crisis and 90 percent are available; it also assumes that 25 percent of foreign crew have signed similar contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Training new seafarers is too slow. During World War II, U.S. War Shipping Administration training programs varied in duration from around 12 weeks for unlicensed sailors to 64 weeks for deck and engineer officers. In a 20-week wargame, said training programs could not produce a class of new seafarers in the time allotted that would impact the manpower capabilities of the naval merchant fleet. At best, a class of under 18,000 previously untrained sailors could complete training and join the fleet in the last quarter of the scenario. Instead, to increase the number of personnel, pre-trained merchant sailors of all ratings would need to be recruited. In 1943, half of the seafarers added, around 45,000, were recruited from maritime unions and the Recruitment and Manning Organization. Similar organizations that exist today could stand as options for sourcing trained seafarers in a time of need, but the time required for this training far exceeds the scope of the starting phase of a blockade scenario. (See Appendix B, Table B.7: U.S. World War II Additional Crewing, forthcoming.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recruiting foreign seafarers is a more promising stream. While about 25 percent of Norwegian and British crews during the world wars were foreigners, the market for seafarers is now much more international. While they might lack nationalistic or idealistic motivations, some would likely respond to financial incentives. To get a ballpark of the costs, the authors estimate that a convoy of 50 ships, each with 30 seafarers, would need 1,500 crew members. There would likely be a convoy every week, so 30,000 positions would need to be filled for a 20-week campaign. If crew members were offered a $10,000 bonus for every trip, that would total $300 million in bonuses. For a war that is costing billions in direct costs and trillions in the global economy, that is an affordable number. Further, there are 1.9 million seafarers currently operating, so even without pulling in inactive seafarers, such a campaign would require only a small percentage of the global seafarer community. Bonuses would not be evenly distributed, as low-skilled deckhands would get smaller amounts while highly skilled engineering personnel would get more. Some specialties, like crews for LNG tankers, might require additional incentives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this does not happen instantly. Even though many seafarers may be willing to brave danger for nationalism or financial compensation, identifying, recruiting, gathering, potentially training, and finally assigning them to ships where their skills are needed takes time. Module 1 allows for this delay and phases ship availability accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example from antiquity illustrates the challenge. At the beginning of Rome’s civil war, Pompey scorned Caesar’s ability to march on Rome, declaring, “in whatever part of Italy I stamp upon the ground, there will spring up armies of foot and horse.” However, after Caesar’s already prepared legions forced him to flee to Greece, he had time to reflect about the timelines required to mobilize manpower during conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report turns next to existing manpower, before looking at the time required to train and recruit new seafarers. At the outset of any conflict, there will be initial turmoil, some confusion, and a period to figure out what needs to be done. There will then be a crash effort to do what needs to be done and expand administrative machinery—leveraging foreign human resources expertise in shipping (and paying for it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Base case, Taiwan can quadruple its recruitment of foreign sailors over the course of a few months. Assuming that the average seafarer serves 12 years, then the administrative machinery in Taiwan’s shipping companies might be set up to find 2,000 sailors a year, or 40 a week. If Taiwan could achieve quadrupling of recruitment over the course of a few months, then the number of foreign seafarers recruited per week would be 0, 0, 40, 60, 80, 120, and 160 each week thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Prepared case, Taiwan can increase its recruitment of foreign sailors by a factor of eight and on a faster timeline. This produces the following numbers of foreign seafarers recruited per week: 0, 40, 80, 160, and 320 each week thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, those crews have to be matched to ships. In the Base case, the 4,800 seafarers initially available (50 percent of Taiwanese seafarers and 10 percent of foreign crews) need to fill 3,018 billets on Taiwanese-owned and Taiwanese-flagged ships. They would need to be transported to Japan to prepare, learn new machinery, sign new contracts, and so on. These Taiwanese seafarers would be available each week on a timeline of 0, 100, 200, 300, 400, 400, and 400 before none are left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case where Taiwan has prepared for conflict by ensuring its ability to requisition all owned ships and the mobilization of seafarers, the numbers change accordingly. It can be assumed that seafarers who do not want to participate in shuttle runs do not leave immediately, or that enough at least enough stay to bring their ship into the theater for shuttle service. Manning 75 percent of Taiwanese-owned ships would require 19,010 seafarers. If 90 percent of Taiwan’s 8,268 seafarers remain, then there will be a pool of 7,441 Taiwanese seafarers. If 25 percent of the 17,905 foreign seafarers on Taiwanese-owned ships stay, there will be 4,476 foreign seafarers remaining. There will therefore be a shortfall of 7,093 seafarers which would have to be made up for by newly recruited foreign sailors. In this case, there would be only enough crew members left over to man one new Very Large Crude Carrier or LNG ship every other week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TRANSITIONING TO MODULE 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Module 1 thus produces a timeline of merchant ships available for shuttle duty. The behavior of the merchant ships available thereafter depends on China’s escalation level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For China’s escalation levels below “Wider War,” the shuttle ships would sail through Japanese territorial waters—until reaching Yonaguni Island, the southernmost Japanese island in the Ryukyu chain. From Yonaguni, these ships “dash” approximately 70 miles to reach Taiwanese ports. If China’s escalation level is “Boarding” or “Submarines and Mines,” ships proceed individually; if China’s escalation level is “Offshore Kinetic,” the ships travel in convoys. Merchant ships’ behavior at the Wider War level depends on player decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In scenarios where China’s escalation level was Wider War, Japanese and Taiwanese territorial waters no longer protected the shuttle ships, and their routing changed accordingly. Goods were transshipped via Australia, with concomitant delays in availability due to increased travel times and reduced port capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In scenarios where the ships were organized into convoys, they were limited to 100 merchant ships, following World War II practice. Larger convoys are difficult to control. This would be especially true in the confined Japanese territorial waters around the Ryukyus. If more than 100 ships were needed to transit, then two convoys sailed in a week. No more than two convoys were allowed per week due to presumed limits on transshipment capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;module-2-how-much-cargo-gets-through-to-taiwan&quot;&gt;Module 2: How Much Cargo Gets Through to Taiwan?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having considered what ships are available to move to Taiwan, this section examines how China might try to board, impound, deter, or sink that shipping and how much of that shipping may succeed in evading the Chinese blockade to arrive in Taiwan. The scenarios and rules of engagement (ROE) that might be employed by both sides demand different methods for modeling and wargaming. Each scenario will require differences in approach, and the farther apart the ROE, the greater those differences will be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite those differences, when the component parts of modeling are considered at the most basic level, there is considerable overlap between the scenarios. For example, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) problems—finding and identifying ships or other targets—are common to all scenarios. Similarly, although attacking ships with ballistic and cruise missiles may not be common to all scenarios, it is nevertheless a constituent part of more than half of the scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion of Module 2 is divided into two parts. The first summarizes the most important constituent models (or building blocks) of the wargame. The second stipulates which of the constituent models are relevant to each of the different scenarios. For that discussion, the scenarios are divided into three groups depending on China’s escalation level. Having summarized the broad outlines of each group, differences between specific scenarios are also addressed within each of those subsections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MODELING: INDIVIDUAL ELEMENTS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wargames can be considered a collection of (often probabilistic) models that are run with periodic pauses during which human players can reallocate resources to different geographic locations or military functions before resuming. Individual aspects of modeling are discussed below. An extensive discussion of military modeling is beyond the scope of this report, but a brief discussion nevertheless provides important context for understanding wargame results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, many of the systems and weapons that would be employed in these scenarios have not been employed in high-intensity combat. Hence, there is significant uncertainty about how systems will perform under wartime conditions, which may differ dramatically from the conditions of peacetime testing. In general, the modeling described here assumes that weapons deployed by both sides function broadly as intended, though not necessarily at rates (or with effectiveness) that would be reflected in peacetime testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bullet points immediately below outline modeling of nine different constituent parts of the gaming: ISR modeling and animation, intercept and boarding, missile defense (of ships and land targets), survivability of warships and merchant ships, lethality of antiship weapons, air-to-air combat, effects of air base attacks, submarine and antisubmarine warfare, and infrastructure attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 4.2: Merchant Damage to Exocet Missile Strike, Tanker War (1980–1988).&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Data on attacks and sinkings is from Martin S. Navias and E. R. Hooton, Tanker Wars: Assault on Merchant Shipping During the Iran-Iraq Crisis, 1980-88 (London: Bloomsbury Publishing, 1996). Data on tonnage of individual ships comes from various sources.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ISR Modeling and Animation: The first problem for China in implementing a blockade is to locate and identify incoming and outgoing maritime traffic. The project developed a program to simulate Chinese earth observation satellites in low Earth orbit. These include over 200 signals intelligence (SIGINT), suspicious activity reports, and electro-optical military and commercial satellites. Each satellite’s capabilities are assumed to be comparable to commercial satellites launched in the same year. The program’s outputs produce detection timelines for emitting and non-emitting ships (the latter being not visible to SIGINT satellites). That information is fed to the intercept model, which adds in over-the-horizon radars and terrestrial sensors. For example, this study’s analysis indicated that a non-emitting ship off the coast of Guam has a 38 percent chance of being identified within 20 minutes; within four hours, it has a 91 percent chance of being identified.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intercept and Boarding of Individual Ships: An animated “Hunters and Escorts” model incorporates results from the ISR modeling above and allows players to attempt boarding and attack of merchant ships heading singly to Taiwan. Players assign missions, manage resources, and stipulate tactics. Based on those instructions, the model adjudicates interactions between individual aircraft, ships, submarines, and merchant vessels belonging to China, Taiwan, the United States, and Japan. Detection mechanisms differ by platform and mission type, with complex probabilistic models used for air-to-air, air-to-surface, and antisubmarine engagements between individual platforms. The world map is layered with zones, landmasses, weather conditions, and receptor grids to simulate interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Missile Defense (Ship and Land Based): When defended maritime or land targets are attacked, intercepts and terminal defenses (where applicable) are modeled. The expenditure of attacking missiles and interceptors is tracked, and intercept probabilities vary according to both interceptor and attacking missile. For example, each interceptor fired by U.S. and Chinese destroyers defends against legacy cruise missiles with a single shot probability of 70 percent. With two interceptors, the probability that the attacking missile penetrates is 0.09 (or 9 percent). Warships are assumed to have terminal defenses which further reduce the probability. When in convoy, merchant ships are defended by the convoy’s long-range interceptors but not by their terminal defenses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Survivability of Warships and Merchants: Modeling damage to ships is more important in wargaming a sustained blockade than in a shorter invasion scenario. Some number of damaged ships can be returned to action in blockade. In considering the munitions necessary to incapacitate or sink warships, historical data suggests that, on average, it may take six to seven 1,000-pound bombs to sink a destroyer, four to sink a frigate, and two to sink a corvette. In each case, significantly fewer weapons are required to achieve a mission kill. And against all targets, there is significant variation around the mean.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;To estimate the likelihood of sinking merchant ships, the project examined historical cases. The Tanker War of 1980–1988 provides especially useful data, derived from a large number (269) of hits by a single type of weapon (Exocet). Hits by Exocet sank, on average, 8.2 percent of targets struck, while they caused the write-off (constructive total loss, or CTL) of 27.9 percent of ships hit. The rate of sinking varied significantly by the size of the ship that was hit (see Table 4.2 below). While the lethality of weapons has improved since then (see below), so too has the survivability of ships (for example, with the double-hulling of tankers). Within the game, damage to both warships and merchants is handled probabilistically and incorporates significant deviation around the expected mean for the attacking weapon and target platform.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lethality of Weapons: The probability of sinking or damaging warships and merchants also considers the size and type of weapon being employed. The total energy of different weapons is calculated by summing the explosive energy of the warhead to the kinetic energy released by the impact of the missile, which is itself a function of weight and speed (see Table 4.3). Because torpedoes strike below the waterline and historical data suggests that, pound for pound, they are far more likely to sink ships, their probability of sinking or damaging ships is estimated at twice that of a comparably sized missile.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Air-to-Air Combat: Modeling of air-to-air combat includes combat between aircraft assigned to the air superiority mission in overlapping areas, fighter sweeps, and escorted strike missions. Air superiority combat calculates aircraft on-station time and yields attrition results and the degree of air control gained. On-station times are a function of flight time to mission areas, crew availability and rest requirements, and tanker support. Attrition rates per encounter (averaging roughly 5 percent) are from data on some of the most intense historical air battles (e.g., August 1940 during the Battle of Britain). Exchange rates are based probabilistically on the “generation” of aircraft involved, with exchange rates of roughly 2:1 for combat between, for example, fourth-generation and 4.5-generation aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Attacks on Air Bases: In some scenarios, attacks on adversary air bases are allowed. When attacks are undertaken, missile defenses located in the area first defend according to the probabilities discussed earlier. The model then attacks missile defenses if located at the target and if their location is detected. It then allocates attacking missiles to attacking hardened shelters, the entrances (or taxiways) to underground shelters, or areas in the open that might be used for aircraft parking. Losses to aircraft parked in each type of area are then calculated. In the case of aircraft parked in the open, the total footprint of the attacking missiles that survive missile defense is compared to the total area on which aircraft might be parked to create a proportion of aircraft physically at the base that would be destroyed. The total number of aircraft present at any one time is assumed to be two-thirds of the aircraft based at the air base; the other third are assumed to be airborne or otherwise not present at parking areas.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Submarine and Antisubmarine Warfare: China’s ability to target ships inbound to Taiwan has been the focus of previous quantitative analyses by Glosny and O’Hanlon, who use historic data to model barrier attrition against submarines. This study uses a similar barrier attrition model in some scenarios, when antisubmarine warfare is one part of a broader campaign. For scenarios where submarine attacks are the main focus, this study uses an agent-based model that incorporates maintenance time, travel time to the area, movement to intercept points (assuming that Chinese ISR provides the submarines with the locations of merchant ships with minimal delay), and the likelihood of successful attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Infrastructure Attacks: China has a large inventory of missiles, drones, and aircraft with which it could bombard Taiwan. Besides targeting Taiwanese leadership and military targets, it could attack ports, offloading ships, or the power grid. This study estimated total Chinese inventories for these systems based on analogies to similar launcher-to-munition ratios (for example, analogizing the BRE-6 missile with the U.S. GMLRS). This study then modeled the effectiveness of attacks with these munitions based on historic cases. Most importantly, the ability of China to destroy Taiwan’s energy infrastructure was based on analogies to Russia’s attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure and U.S. attacks on Iraqi power plants during Desert Storm.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;APPLYING MODELS IN SPECIFIC SCENARIOS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As described previously, the games associated with this project address different scenarios which are themselves primarily (though not solely) defined by the level of escalation assumed for each side. Importantly, the authors do not necessarily expect conflict to remain in one cell (or one scenario) throughout its course; indeed, escalation or de-escalation is likely. But tracking events in a conflict that plays out entirely within one cell allows for a cleaner assessment of the dynamics that might characterize that level of conflict, of likely advantage (e.g., China or the coalition), and of the pressures for either escalation or de-escalation from that point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To model different scenarios, the games used three systems. The systems used depended on China’s escalation level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/phcdqqb.png&quot; alt=&quot;image14&quot; /&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ISR and Intercept&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“ISR and Intercept” is a simulation designed to explore the implications of a military conflict around Taiwan, with particular focus on China’s efforts to disrupt the flow of merchants to the island at lower levels of escalation. The simulation models interactions between multiple agents—aircraft, ships, submarines, and merchant vessels—belonging to China, the United States, Taiwan, and Japan. The world map is layered with zones, landmasses, weather conditions, and receptor grids to simulate interactions. Players can influence the simulation by assigning missions, managing resources, and adapting strategies. Key agent behaviors include detecting, tracking, attacking, and defending, with detailed rules for engagement based on escalation levels and mission types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agents have well-defined roles and characteristics such as visibility, detection capabilities, speed, endurance, and combat proficiency. Their missions include patrolling, tracking, holding, attacking, and conducting antisubmarine operations. Combat effectiveness is probabilistically modeled based on attacker/defender skills and weapon availability. Detection mechanisms differ by platform and mission type, with complex probabilistic models used for air-to-air, air-to-surface, and antisubmarine engagements. Agent availability for missions is calculated based on maintenance requirements and endurance limits. Search patterns are determined by a “Chaotic Ant Colony” model, where each agent searching in a zone leaves pheromones that repel other agents, leading to a distributed search pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agents can pursue a variety of missions, including observing, tracking, holding, attacking, patrolling, and escorting. The simulation incorporates a mission structure for “hunter” units like unmanned aerial vehicles and submarines as well as “escort” units that defend merchants. Managers coordinate agent behavior within each country, factoring in communication delays and tactical decisionmaking. Each mission type is linked to specific triggers and outcomes, ensuring dynamic interactions between agents. Chinese and coalition forces (the United States, Japan, and Taiwan) have distinct restrictions and permissions based on the scenario’s escalation level. Within each escalation level, players can make changes to ROE and force allocation during the simulation. Overall, the system offers a robust framework for analyzing potential military scenarios, with realism grounded in tactical detail and operational flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Convoy Battle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a scenario with a Chinese escalation level of Offshore Kinetic or Wider War, the contending parties employ lethal military forces within international waters and airspace but not within the sovereign air, land, or maritime territories of the adversaries. “Convoy Battle” explores what would occur when protected convoys are attacked at sea. The model focuses on the attack and defense of convoys escorted by Taiwanese and U.S. warships operating between Japanese and Taiwanese ports but was adapted for other convoy routes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The action revolves around convoys run between Japan’s Yonaguni Island and the east side of Taiwan in the vicinity of Hualian (see Figure 4.2), a distance of 54 nm (100 km). Military engagements can be conducted over a wider area, though only in international waters, and occur before and during each convoy transit. The modeling for these scenarios is broken into two different components, both of which are run for each convoy that makes the transit. (The frequency of convoys is determined by the U.S.-Taiwan team and is based largely on the number of merchant ships available for transit.) The two elements of the modeling are (1) shaping operations and (2) the convoy crossing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shaping Operations: Both sides may deploy forces to gain an advantageous position in preparation for each convoy battle. The duration is defined by expected transit times for Chinese diesel submarines moving roughly 210 nm from China to the area around the convoy route. At five to six knots, two-way transit would be roughly three days. The United States may deploy SSNs into this area to intercept submarines. Both sides may attempt to deploy antisubmarine warfare maritime patrol aircraft (MPAs) in areas off their own territory and may deploy combat aircraft to contest air control, destroy adversary MPAs, and protect friendly assets. The most important modeling components are air-to-air combat and submarine and antisubmarine warfare (with support elements).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Convoy Attack and Defense: Both sides may allocate assets to the attack and defense of convoys. Chinese submarines that have made the transit attempt to penetrate convoy defenses and attack merchants (or escorts). Chinese forces may fire air-, sea-, or ground-launched missiles from within China’s own sovereign territory. Alternatively, China may sortie aircraft and warships into closer areas to attack with shorter-range weapons. If Chinese assets do sortie, then they may be engaged by U.S. aircraft and warships, which may, depending on their location, be fired upon in turn. The most important modeling components are air-to-air combat, missile attacks on ships, air and missile defense, and submarine and antisubmarine warfare.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In keeping with the spatial and temporal limits of the action within this scenario, as well as the lengthy expected duration of a blockade, limits are placed on the number of systems and assets that can be placed into each part of each convoy battles, and those limits have an important impact on outcomes. (Variations explore alternative possibilities.) For the shaping battle, the modeling assumes that eight submarines (roughly 20 percent of the submarine fleet), 12 MPAs, and 144 tactical aircraft can be employed by the two sides. Convoy sizes are limited to 100 merchant ships, based on World War II practice. The convoy escort is limited to two surface action groups (SAGs) (eight ships total if they are U.S. ships or more ships if the ships are Taiwanese). Both sides can call on up to four SAGs to provide antiship fires. China can allocate up to 200 antiship missiles against the convoy from its various platforms during the roughly five-hour transit through international waters (and 100 more if additional U.S. SAGs sortie).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is, of course, possible to imagine battles of varying sizes and intensities; both sides would have considerably more forces during an extended conflict. But there are likely limits to how much force can productively be brought to bear within a limited period and in a limited area. And even with the capability to bring additional forces to the fight, Chinese commanders may look to ensure that operations are sustainable over weeks and months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A variant scenario explored the possibility that China could and would allocate more resources to attacking each convoy, that its command and control would prove flexible and adaptive, and that U.S. countermeasures might prove ineffective in neutralizing some of China’s advanced technologies. In this sensitivity analysis, China is assumed to be able to coordinate a larger number of more diverse assets to conduct attacks with twice as many missiles (400) over the five-hour period. Unlike the Base case, where both sides declare their offensive and defensive choices and both execute, China can execute parts of its attack and then adjust subsequent means of attack depending on results. Finally, Chinese missile seekers are assumed to be more effective in the Base case in finding warships among the convoys in the face of U.S. countermeasures. Elements of this variant might also be considered as a stand-in for cases in which China does not strike at targets within Japanese air and maritime space but is willing to execute attacks on Taiwanese and U.S. assets within Taiwan’s territorial waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Taiwan Operational Wargame&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To explore cases where both sides escalate to the level of a general or wider war, the project employs the Taiwan Operational Wargame (TOW). The First Battle report contains a detailed description of the wargame; important elements of it are summarized in the section on modeling above. TOW provides rules and adjudication tables and probabilities for different kinds of attacks on air bases; missile, air, and submarine attacks on warships; antisubmarine warfare by surface ships, MPAs, and other submarines; and counterspace and ISR activities. Forces are free to conduct a range of missions. The modeling of convoy attack and defense was added to the TOW system to enable the wargaming of a contested convoy in the context of a wider war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;module-3-what-is-the-material-effect-of-the-cargo-arriving-on-taiwan&quot;&gt;Module 3: What Is the Material Effect of the Cargo Arriving on Taiwan?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Module 3 has three elements—imports, economic outputs, and effects on Taiwanese society—and does calculations for each week of the blockade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;INPUTS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ship Arrivals: The first element of this module translates ship arrivals by type into cargo measures. Consistent with the ship types in Module 1, deliveries are tankers with oil and petroleum products (measured in barrels), LNG carriers with natural gas (in cubic meters), and bulk and container ships (general cargo, including food and coal, in tons). General cargo is measured by weight because weight matters for import calculations and the constraint in a blockade is cargo capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cross-Strait Trade: Taiwan’s cross-strait trade with China constitutes 37 percent of its non-energy imports, yet this could end with a single decision by the Chinese leadership. Cessation would have a severe effect on Taiwan’s economy because of the trade’s magnitude and how tightly logistics chains are designed. Although the modeling assumes substitution from other sources, some elements are custom designed for specific products and processes on the mainland and might be difficult to replace. Without cross-strait trade, Taiwanese manufacturing would decline approximately 20 percent. About 75 percent of Taiwan’s imported consumer goods come from cross-strait trade. The model gives consumer goods lower priority so that imports can focus on critical energy and manufacturing. The project’s initial inclination was to assume that China would stop all cross-strait trade in any kind of a blockade since it counteracts the blockade’s intended effects. However, several trade experts pointed out that any cessation of cross-strait trade would also damage China’s economy. For every batch of microchips that Taiwan sends to China, Taiwan gets their value in return. China can use these chips to manufacture end products of much greater value like cars and appliances. Thus, Module 3 allows different levels of cross-strait trade should China decide on something between full trade and none.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many examples of countries allowing trade through their blockade when it was in their interest to do so. For example, the Union government in the U.S. Civil War allowed the South to ship cotton north because northern textile mills needed it. Particularly in the low-end scenarios, China might exempt cross-strait trade from a blockade since these ships would be in compliance with any blockade restrictions in the normal course of operations, and continuing China’s own trade while trade with other countries declined would increase China’s economic leverage over Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The module treats cross-strait traffic not on a ship-by-ship basis, as with other traffic, but as a group, which is adjusted by percentages: No change (100 percent), half (50 percent), proportional (which aligns cross-strait trade with the levels of other trade), and none (0 percent). (Appendix E, “Details on Escalation Levels,” forthcoming, specifies cross-strait traffic for each escalation level.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;OUTPUTS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electricity Generation and Usage: Electricity production and usage are critical economic activities because they underpin both industrial production and the population’s well-being. Energy is also a major driver of imports, as the raw materials for electricity production constitute 22 percent of total imports by weight (energy imports overall for electricity, transportation, industry, and other uses total 50 percent of imports). There are five component fuels in the electricity production system: natural gas, coal, oil, renewables, and nuclear. Natural gas, oil, and coal come almost entirely from external sources. Renewables and nuclear power do not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This element of the module calculates electricity generated per week based on the following factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deliveries: These come from the ship arrivals described above.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Initial Inventories of Natural Gas, Coal, and Oil: The default is the current level as publicly reported: oil—146 days, 118,000,000 barrels; natural gas—12 days, 1,000 million cubic meters (mcm); coal—45 days, 7,000,000 tons. Inventories are drawn down to make up any import shortfalls, thus allowing electricity production to continue at pre-blockade levels if imports decline below the required amounts. When inventories run out, production occurs at whatever level imports will sustain. If imports exceed pre-blockade usage, the excess goes into inventory.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Allocation of Energy Inputs: Pre-blockade, some energy inputs go to industry, commercial activities, and residences (23 percent of coal, 17 percent of natural gas) and the rest to electricity production. Only 1 percent of oil and petroleum products are used for electricity production. (The module lumps together crude oil and petroleum products like gasoline, diesel, and petroleum gas since they are somewhat fungible with refining and the choice of tankers.) To maintain electricity generation in an emergency, some of these energy inputs shift from other sectors to electricity production. In effect, it sacrifices economic activity for the health, safety, and comfort of the population.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Electricity Production: The module calculates electricity production from raw material inputs based on historical relationships between inputs and outputs. For example, in the past, 397 million cubic meters of natural gas produced 2,077,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) weekly, or 5,231,738 kWh per million cubic meters of natural gas. The module used this factor for any changes in imports of energy raw material.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nuclear Power: The module assumes that Taiwan continued operations of its last nuclear power plant. However, Taiwan stopped operations of this plant in May 2025 as this study was being completed. Loss of nuclear power will reduce Taiwan’s electricity production capacity by 6 percent until other sources can expand.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Voluntary Reductions: Under this policy, the government requests users to reduce their electrical usage; for example, this may include no outside lighting (signs, streetlights), minimum daytime lighting for buildings, no lighting in unoccupied buildings, and temperatures in occupied buildings set to 80 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer and 65 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter. This reduces electrical demand by 4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mandatory Reductions: The government requires ending all nonessential electrical usage, such as areas described for voluntary reductions. This produces an additional 5 percent reduction.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Private Generators: If authorized, private generators allow more oil to be used for electrical generation. Although private generation is not as efficient as large power stations, it leverages oil inventories that are relatively much larger than inventories of coal or natural gas. Natural gas supplies expire early, before coal and oil, because of storage difficulties and the scarcity of Taiwanese-controlled LNG tankers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chinese Interdiction: In some scenarios, China might attack the production facilities or transmission systems of Taiwan’s electrical system. The model provides for such attacks based on bomb tonnage dropped, as described in the section on scenario variants.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Blockade Running: As described in Chapter 2, private blockade running could provide imports that do not come through official sources. Predicting the level of blockade running is difficult because it has not been seen in recent conflicts. Blockade running might not be possible at all because of decisions by the Taiwanese government, the tightness of China’s blockade, or Chinese pressure on regional governments. When blockade running is possible, the wargame hypothesizes a daily level equivalent to one bulk carrier of 38,000 tons or one small container ship of 7,000 tons. Twenty-eight percent of the cargo was assumed to be coal, consistent with pre-blockade averages.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 4.3: Excerpt from Module 3 Showing Calculations for Electricity Production.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS Defense and Security Department.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 4.3 is an excerpt from Module 3 with calculations for one week of electricity production. Column A shows the element in the electrical system, Column B shows pre-blockade values, Column C shows values for the previous week, Column D shows values for the week in question, and Columns E and F show projections if imports were to stay at that week’s level. The rows are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Electricity production from natural gas, coal, oil, private generators, nuclear, and renewables (lines 19–24 respectively)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inventories of natural gas, coal, and oil (lines 25–27). When these run out, electricity production declines to whatever level imports will support.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Total electricity production (line 29)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any decrement for Chinese attacks on ports and the electrical system (line 30)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A comparison of total electricity production with three benchmarks: pre-blockade (line 31), demand after deducting for voluntary reductions (lines 32, 33), and demand after deducting for voluntary and mandatory reductions (lines 34, 35)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This example shows the situation at the end of week 1 of the “Zero Baseline,” a scenario described in Chapter 5, “Analysis of Wargame Results.” Electricity production has continued at 100 percent of pre-blockade levels by drawing down inventories. However, projecting into the future, electricity production would decline as the inventory of natural gas is exhausted. At that level, the government would impose mandatory reductions, so row 35 would be the correct metric. At week 4 (not shown), production bumps up 6 percent as private generators kick in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL EFFECTS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effects of Electricity Production Levels: This element of the module translates levels of electricity production into effects on industry and the population. The module uses pre-blockade usage as the baseline and specifies effects on each sector at the 80 percent, 60 percent, 40 percent, and 20 percent levels of electricity production. It allocates electricity to six sectors (energy sector use, industrial non-electronics, industrial electronics, residential, services, and other/transportation), prioritizes them, and estimates the impact in each sector. Chip and electronics production are protected until electricity production gets so low that the health and safety of the population are threatened. Other industrial production is sacrificed as electricity production declines. Residential electrical use declines sharply at the beginning, with voluntary and then mandatory reductions, but is partly protected after that to reduce hardship on the population. Rail and agriculture are protected—rail because private transportation will decline and therefore public transportation needs to sustain a minimum level of mobility, agriculture because continued production is needed to minimize food imports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reduction of electricity production would affect manufacturing and society as follows, based on percentage of pre-blockade production:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;80 percent: Most manufacturing continues, though steel and mineral operations are cut by 27 percent (aligning with likely energy reductions). Construction and consumer goods face steep reductions. Steel production is cut sharply because of its high import tonnage, large energy needs, and relatively low value added.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;60 percent: Most manufacturing (except steel) runs at about 60 percent capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;40 percent: Iron and mineral materials operations are reduced to 7 percent and 20 percent, respectively. Most other manufacturing continues but is scaled way back. Agriculture inputs are still protected. Most consumer imports are stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;20 percent: All manufacturing ceases. No consumer goods are imported. Electricity supports only emergency services.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effects of Non-Energy Import Levels: To better assess the effects of non-energy import reductions, Module 3 examines them separately and disaggregates them into 11 categories: mineral products (industrial), food (consumer), non-food animal/vegetable products (industrial), plastics (industrial), wood/paper (industrial), wood/paper/textiles (consumer), chemicals (industrial), base metals (industrial), miscellaneous finished goods (consumer), machinery/transportation (industrial), and miscellaneous (industrial).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like energy production, imports prioritize the population’s health and safety, with medical supplies, food, and pharmaceuticals being protected to the end. After that, imports prioritize industry because that is Taiwan’s economic lifeblood. Industry operations also support employment. Consumer items have lower priority. Food is a consumer exception, receiving the highest priority. Capital goods have a lower priority because the service life of existing machinery can be extended; spare parts therefore have a higher priority. Construction is the lowest priority since its value is long term and projects can pause until the blockade ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hu8v01u.png&quot; alt=&quot;image17&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 4.5: Blockade Effects by Economic Activity and Severity.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS Defense and Security Department.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 4.5 shows how different economic activities decline when following the prioritization described above. Effects are estimated at 80, 60, 40, and 20 percent of pre-blockade levels, including cross-strait reductions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chip Production: Chip production is not constrained by import levels because the raw materials, though crucial, are not heavy or bulky. Chip production could continue if (1) chips and electronics have priority for electricity and water (which the module provides), (2) air traffic is still possible for exporting the finished chips, and (3) either there are waivers for civilian aircraft to import some hazardous chemicals and gases needed in chip production or if military aircraft were used. However, at the 40 percent electricity level, Module 3 cuts electricity availability for chip and electronics manufacturing by 44 percent to protect a minimum level of residential electricity usage. Chip production continues but at a reduced level. At the 20 percent level, electricity availability for electronics manufacturing would be only 8 percent of what it was pre-blockade. Nearly all production would stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food: In blockades, thought turns naturally to food, since it is vital for human existence. Images of starving populations proliferate in historical examples, such as Germany at the end of World War I, Leningrad in 1941–1944, the Netherlands in 1944–1945, and Biafra (the breakaway Nigerian province) in 1968–1970. However, these were exceptional circumstances driven by highly effective blockades that were maintained for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project did a separate food analysis, described in detail in Appendix A, “Taiwan Food Analysis” (forthcoming). The bottom line is that feeding a population is logistically relatively easy, and that is true in Taiwan’s case. Taiwan produces about 45 percent of its food requirements by weight (30 percent by calories). The remaining 55 percent requires only about 5 percent of its total import volume (10 percent if livestock feed and industrial uses are included). Nevertheless, Module 3 gives food imports the highest priority because of their direct effect on the population. Although diet might get monotonous as import levels and inventories decline, the population would not go hungry unless blockade levels reached extreme levels where less than 20 percent of pre-blockade imports got through and then remained at these levels for many months. Even if China blocked all imports, including food—and accepted the global criticism for deliberately starving a population—Taiwan could feed its population for nine months using both domestic production and inventories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conduct-of-the-wargame-iterations&quot;&gt;Conduct of the Wargame Iterations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project ran 26 iterations of the game using the rules for the three modules as described above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twenty-one iterations looked at fixed dyads that simulated a 20-week blockade in one-week steps. These were conducted by the project staff and not outside participants for two reasons: First, making reasonable decisions quickly required players to be familiar with the issues involved; thus, these fixed-dyad games could simulate 20 weeks in one day, whereas the free-play games with outside players would simulate just three to five weeks in one day. Second, because the issues involved were less political and more operational, there was less need for outside perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To gain those outside perspectives on escalation, the project conducted five free-play iterations. These simulated only three to five weeks because of the need for multiplayer teams to discuss and decide on a move. The combination of fixed dyads and free-play games allowed the project to gain insights into both the long-term effects of different blockade scenarios and the dynamics of escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gameplay for Free-Play Iterations: These iterations began with the four teams (China, the United States, Japan, and Taiwan) being given the parameters for a scenario derived from the scenario development process described earlier. Each team had two to four participants, generally more on the U.S. and China teams and fewer on the Taiwan and Japan teams. The Japan and Taiwan teams played separately from the U.S. team to better capture the different interests of these countries and give each team agency. The U.S., Taiwan, and Japan teams could communicate freely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The teams thought about how to operate under the game parameters and then made their move. Once all teams moved, the project staff adjudicated the results. Finally, the U.S. coalition and China teams were given the opportunity to communicate as a way to enrich the implementation of strategies and search for an off-ramp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Players were instructed to make the most effective moves they could and not try to anticipate what those governments might do in this situation. Those actions are uncertain, and giving players discretion expands the range of strategies pursued, thus providing broader insights and reducing the possibility of future surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gameplay continued for about six hours during a single day. Based on previous experience, this is the maximum that senior players can devote to a wargame. At the end, there was a “hot wash,” where participants and game staff discussed their insights about the gameplay and what it means for policy choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Free-Play Game Participants: Having outside participants engages a broader set of experience and elicits ideas about courses of action that the staff might not have envisioned. The project used CSIS’s extensive contacts in government, think tanks, academia, and the military to attract a wide range of experts to participate in the games. These included many retired general and flag officers, several serving senior officers, former service secretaries and under/assistant secretaries of defense, and senior think tank scholars. The Taiwanese and Japanese players came from Taipei’s and Tokyo’s foreign policy communities or had a background in East Asian culture and politics. Similarly, at least some players on the China team had extensive knowledge of China’s military and politics. There were no players from China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with the previous project, participants included some junior scholars involved with research in these areas. Including junior scholars brings a different perspective and provides them with a professional development opportunity to participate in a wargame and interact directly with senior scholars and practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;analysis-of-wargame-results&quot;&gt;Analysis of Wargame Results&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter describes the results of the 26 game iterations. The chapter begins with an explanation of the victory conditions, then summarizes game results. The first result is the “Zero Baseline,” which shows what an absolute blockade would do under three cases: Base, Prepared, and More Green Energy. Next, the chapter lays out results from the individual scenarios (1x1, 1x2, 2x1, 2x2, 2x3, 3x2, 3x3, 3x4, 4x2, 4x3, 4x4) and variants within them. The chapter closes by examining the results and major decisions of the free-play games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;victory-conditions&quot;&gt;Victory Conditions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first question asked about a wargame is generally, “Who won?” However, for this series of wargames, there were no standard victory conditions because a blockade’s success or failure rests on whether the target or the blockading force gives up under hardship. This was different from the previous project’s invasion scenarios, where a judgment could be made regarding whether China would have successfully occupied the island. Here, there was no way to know at what level of hardship Taiwan might opt to submit or China might decide that the effort costs too much. Arguments can be made that Taiwan would demonstrate extreme endurance, like Malta in World War II, or exhibit less robust resistance, as a result of Chinese subversion and information operations. Similarly, China might sustain a great effort to “reunify” Taiwan or back off when China’s population feels squeezed. Instead, this report shows the blockade’s effect on Taiwan’s economy and society, leaving judgments about outcomes to the readers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;summary-of-game-outcomes&quot;&gt;Summary of Game Outcomes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section has three parts: the “Zero Baseline,” the 21 individual iterations for each dyad, and the five free-play games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 5.1 provides a results summary for direct comparison between scenarios. “Average Percentage of Electricity Demand Met” presents the average across 20 weeks of the wargame. “Number of Casualties” refers to lives lost in each scenario. Casualty estimates were based on crew complement of the lost vessel or aircraft and does not include possible losses from land-based casualties. Free-play games are not depicted because they ran for a shorter period of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/cG15htn.png&quot; alt=&quot;image18&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 5.1: Summary of Game Outcomes.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS Defense and Security Department.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A blockade scenario is not a bloodless endeavor for either party at any escalation level. That said, limiting escalation to level 1 or 2 would result in significantly lower human costs for both sides. As Figure 5.1 demonstrates, the level 4 escalation scenarios have many more casualties in comparison to the lower-escalation iterations. For example, coalition casualties are 5.5 times greater in the 4x4 Base scenario than in the 3x3 Base scenario, and China’s casualties are 5 times greater. Comparing the 2x2 Base scenario with the 4x4 Base, the coalition’s casualties went from 2,256 to 20,529, China’s casualties from 206 to 13,515.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lowest electricity production rates were found in scenarios with asymmetric escalation levels in China’s favor and the 4x3 and 4x4 scenarios where China attacked Taiwan’s electrical system. Electricity production did best in Prepared scenarios or where Taiwan had an escalatory advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-zero-baseline&quot;&gt;The “Zero Baseline”&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before analyzing any of the individual scenarios, the project established the “Zero Baseline”: What would happen in an absolute blockade where nothing could get through? It is an extreme case, as some resources do get through in all the scenarios examined in this study, but it does provide a baseline that is useful for comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project examines three cases of the Zero Baseline: Base, Prepared, and More Green Energy. Although electricity production and economic activity in all three iterations eventually declined to critical levels, the slower decline in some iterations could provide enough time to produce a diplomatic settlement or intervention by outside powers such as the United States. Cross-strait trade was set at zero since this simulated an absolute blockade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Base case assumed no change from day-to-day operations before the blockade began. Thus, there was no expansion of inventories and no plan for allocation of energy or mandatory electricity conservation. It did include voluntary electricity reductions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Prepared” included adding two weeks of energy inventory, mandatory conservation, fuel rationing, and allocation of electricity based on economic and social priorities. These changes reflect a scenario wherein the Republic of China has made certain policy changes that could be beneficial in a blockade scenario (see “Prepared” description under Chapter 4, Module 3). Not surprisingly, this variant does best, providing more electricity for longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the More Green Energy variant projected where Taiwan’s energy balance would be as a result of climate and environmental concerns, including the elimination of nuclear power, a reduction in coal-fired plants with an offsetting increase in natural gas–fueled plants, and a 20 percent increase in renewable sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Taiwan’s environmental and climate concerns undermine its energy security in a conflict in the near and medium terms. The lowest line in Figure 5.2 illustrates an energy structure based on Taiwan’s plans. These policies sustained far less electricity production in a crisis than other variants. The first reason is that natural gas ran out quickly because of limited inventories. The second reason is that coal, which is easier to store and therefore available in larger inventories, was less important. The third is that nuclear power was gone. Thus, by week 8 (identified in Figure 5.2 by a vertical line), electricity production under More Green Energy was down to 18 percent of needs, whereas it was at 75 percent in other variants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s stated policy is to have 60–70 percent renewables by 2050. This would produce a system generally more resilient to blockade because renewables do not depend on continuous imports. However, there will be decades of vulnerability until this shift can be made, even if such a large shift is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/zpUYnh5.png&quot; alt=&quot;image19&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 5.2: Electricity Production Over 20 Weeks in a Zero Baseline as a Percentage of Demand.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS Defense and Security Department.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the economy’s resilience would likely be weak. The module assumed that other industries had only one week of inventory because of complex logistics chains and “just-in-time” logistics policies. Preparations might increase that to two weeks. After that, most activities in the economy would stop without imports. Chip production and electronics might continue because they rely less on inventories, and some inputs could come in by air, assuming that is still viable. Cannibalization and repairs could keep some machinery and vehicles going for extended periods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The week-by-week description below illustrates what this would mean for Taiwan’s economy and society in the Base case with some elements of preparation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Week 1: Absolute blockade imposed. Taiwan immediately asks its citizens to make voluntary reductions in energy usage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Week 2: Electricity production uses inventories to remain at pre-blockade levels, adjusted for the voluntary reductions. Manufacturing continues.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Week 3: Natural gas inventories are exhausted, and electricity production drops to 73 percent of pre-blockade levels. Private generators are authorized since oil supplies are relatively large compared to natural gas and coal. The government imposes mandatory electricity reductions. Chip and electronics manufacturing continues as before, but other manufacturing is cut in half as inputs dry up. Agriculture and residential electricity use is protected—the former to maintain domestic food production, the latter to reduce hardship on the population. Consumer goods gradually disappear as inventories decline. Active markets for used items spring up. Repair and recycling businesses expand.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Week 9: Coal inventories are depleted, and electricity production declines to 24 percent of pre-blockade levels. Virtually all manufacturing ceases, including electronics and chip production. Most commercial establishments shut down or operate without electricity. Residential electricity operates only 12 hours a day.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Week 21: Electricity production declines to 17 percent as oil inventories are depleted. Only nuclear and renewables remain as sources of electrical power. Only emergency services receive electricity; none is available for industrial or commercial activities. Residential electricity is reduced to 10 hours a day. All private transportation ceases, though some public transportation continues. Food supplies are adequate, however.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Weeks 21–36: No change in electricity. Food is adequate but becomes increasingly monotonous.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Week 36: Food begins to run out as inventories become exhausted. Domestic production can only sustain about 1,000 kcal/person without imported fertilizers and livestock feed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prepared variant delays these adverse events by about three weeks, not reaching the level of “severe” reductions until week 12 (involving chip production reduced to half of pre-blockade levels, the shutdown of other electronics and manufacturing, and the reduction of residential electricity to 21 hours/day) or “crisis” level until week 18 (most economic activity shut down, emergency services only). The More Green Energy variant hits the “severe” level in week 3 and “crisis” in week 7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;analysis-of-the-individual-scenarios&quot;&gt;Analysis of the Individual Scenarios&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section describes the results of each individual scenario and scenario variant as laid out in Chapter 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dyads on the diagonal have multiple iterations, while dyads off the diagonal do not. This is because dyads on the diagonal (1x1, 2x2, 3x3, and 4x4) represent roughly equivalent levels of escalation and therefore are more sensitive to changes in assumptions. Dyads off the diagonal represent scenarios where one side had a substantial escalatory advantage, so the outcome is less likely to be sensitive to changes in assumptions. This asymmetry should be kept in mind when judging iteration outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project analyzed the outcome of each game iteration using a set of standard metrics: losses, electricity production, and imports displayed in a summary table, as shown in Table 5.1, and economic metrics described with Figure 5.2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Energy Production: Production is measured as a percentage of demand, with demand being adjusted for voluntary or mandatory reductions, depending on the scenario. One snapshot is taken at the end of the scenario, and the other at the worst week during the game iteration. Examining the worst week shows the maximum level of hardship that the population would have to endure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Import Level: This compares the amount of non-fuel imports with the pre-blockade levels. That percentage gives a rough sense of the economic effects of the blockade. As with energy production, the import level also looks at the worst week in the scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Merchant Ship Arrivals by Country: This provides the total number of merchant ships across the 20 weeks of a scenario that made it successfully to Taiwan. The total number of arrivals demonstrates the level of success of convoys compared to the number of merchant ships lost shown in the next row. Because ships could do multiple trips, this number does not equal the number of ships.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Losses by Country: The project tracks military losses, including aircraft, warships, and submarines, as well as law enforcement and coast guard vessels. Because economics are central to the success or failure of a blockade, the project also tracks merchant ship losses, both private and government owned. Finally, personnel casualties are estimated based on historical experiences with equipment losses and military operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DYAD: CHINA BOARDING VS. TAIWAN CONSTRAINED (1X1)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this first dyad, China used only the China Coast Guard (CCG), Maritime Safety Administration (MSA), and the People’s Armed Force Maritime Militia (PAFMM), while Taiwan’s military forces were limited to operations in their own waters. The United States and Japan were uninvolved. Cross-strait trade continued as normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because there were no coalition combat vessels, there were no convoys. Thus, this was not a combat scenario but more like a game of “cat and mouse.” Taiwan-bound ships tried to evade the screen of Chinese nonmilitary vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any iteration in this dyad would create strong escalatory pressures on Taiwan. China’s maritime intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) could effectively locate merchants as they approached the exclusion zone and vector forces to intercept positions within the exclusion zone. Even with the constraints of periodic maintenance, resupply, and travel times, China always had many ships on station. These were enough to drive Taiwan’s electricity production and imports to low levels. Taiwan would have to either make concessions to China sufficient to get China to cease its boarding campaign, escalate by using military force against Chinese forces in the exclusion zone, or get the United States to intervene on its behalf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Iteration 1: China Boarding vs. Taiwan Constrained (1x1) Base&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s merchant ship losses were due to boarding and seizure, not gunfire and missiles, so there were no Taiwanese personnel casualties. As there was no resistance to this effort, there were similarly no Chinese casualties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Figure 5.3 shows, few merchants got through (13 percent overall). Merchants got through more frequently when weather conditions prevented Chinese VBSS operations. This suggests that traveling during rough seas could be an effective response to some forms of Chinese coercion, although the amount of cargo that could get in during these time windows would fall far short of Taiwan’s requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/oftzp0K.png&quot; alt=&quot;image22&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 5.3: Economic Impacts (1x1) Base.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS Defense and Security Department.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Energy inventories declined steadily since so few imports arrived. Electricity production declined in steps as inventories were exhausted. In this and all other scenarios, any electricity production after the exhaustion of inventories came from weekly deliveries, nuclear power, and renewables, with some variation based on the behavior of private generators using non-government oil reserves. The spike in electricity production in week 19 occurred because the Taiwan team elected to husband their purchased LNG tankers for a concerted blockade run; five of the seven LNG tankers were seized by China in that run, but two made it. They were subsequently captured when leaving Taiwanese waters. The meager returns on this effort underscore the strength of China’s nonmilitary options against a constrained Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;As this is the first of many similar figures showing economic impacts of a blockade on Taiwan, some explanation is important. On the top graphic, the horizontal scale shows weeks, up to 20. The vertical scale is the percentage of the pre-blockade level. There are five lines. One solid line is the level of electricity production. The other solid line is the level of imports, excluding energy. As Chinese cross-strait trade continues at various levels depending on the Chinese escalation level, it is possible for non-energy imports to remain above zero even if no merchants arrive. Cargo imports are capped at 100 percent of peacetime levels given the following justifications: (1) Peacetime cargo reaching the transshipment point would be limited to 100 percent, (2) more cargo would not be needed, (3) if there was excess cargo capacity, some ships would not be filled to capacity in order to spread out the risk, or (4) excess merchants would be sent empty in order to improve the survival chances of laden merchants.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The three dotted lines all show inventory levels. Inventories are important because they provide a buffer against interrupted imports. Note that these dotted lines represent inventories, not arrivals. It often happens that energy raw materials arrive but are used in the week of arrival to produce electricity and thus do not change the level of inventories. Inventories are capped at the prepared level (two weeks of additional inventory) since their expansion hits limits on storage capacity.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The bottom graphic shows the number of ship arrivals by week, with the scale varying according to the data. Cross-strait trade is included separately as an activity, not by ship, since the level is set by policy and not by Chinese interdiction. Thus, cross-strait trade does not show up in ship arrivals.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Iteration 2: China Boarding vs. Taiwan Constrained (1x1) Prepared with CGA Variant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even a Prepared Taiwan that used the Coast Guard Administration (CGA) to attack Chinese boarding ships was unable to deal with a Chinese campaign at this scale, although adequate electricity production could be maintained longer. Some of Taiwan’s CGA ships (the Taichung, Anping, and Shun Hu 10 classes) were armed with antiship cruise missiles (ASCMs) and powerful deck guns that allowed them to outmatch even the demilitarized ex-PLAN ships in the CCG. However, over time they were simply outnumbered, and by week 20, Taiwan was in the same place as the Base case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/FmquMrD.png&quot; alt=&quot;image23&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 5.3: Results Summary (1x1) Prepared.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS Defense and Security Department.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike in the Base case, there were Chinese casualties in the Prepared case due to Taiwan’s CGA attacking Chinese boarding ships in the exclusion zone. However, Taiwan’s ability to destroy Chinese ships paled in comparison to the number of Chinese ships available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Prepared variant, inventories of coal, oil, and gas declined more slowly than in the Base case. As a result, electricity production did not go below 50 percent until week 13 versus week 9 in the Base case. Imports stayed above 20 percent until week 20, whereas the Base case hit that level in week 1. However, even the greater numbers of Taiwanese merchants posited by the Prepared variant were eventually attrited down and unable to resupply Taiwan. By week 20, imports were only 3 percent higher than in the Base case, and electricity production was 4 percent higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if the CGA only fired at Chinese ships that were attempting to board and Chinese ships did not fire back, they only reduced the rate of seizures in the first four weeks from 89 percent in the Base case to 73 percent. The problem was Chinese numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DYAD: CHINA BOARDING VS. TAIWAN ASSERTIVE (1X2)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dyad pitted Chinese nonmilitary forces against Taiwanese military forces. The Republic of China Air Force (ROCAF) and Republic of China Navy (ROCN) engaged in direct combat against Chinese CCG, MSA, and PAFMM vessels operating in the exclusion zone. Chinese ships only returned fire if they were attacked and if they were armed. Taiwanese merchants continued to operate individually as shuttles coming from Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/S0r6Bvf.png&quot; alt=&quot;image24&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 5.4: Economic Impacts (1x1) Prepared.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS Defense and Security Department.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scenario created strong escalatory pressures on China. If Taiwan is willing to use military force against Chinese boarding, then its military is more than capable of rapidly destroying most of the CCG, MSA, and PAFMM ships sent. As an “off-diagonal” scenario, the correlation of escalation between China and Taiwan is imbalanced: Taiwan is using military forces against nonmilitary (though militarized) Chinese forces. China would quickly lose many ships. It would have to decide between abandoning its effort or escalating to direct kinetic action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although this iteration allowed Taiwanese forces to destroy as many Chinese ships as physically possible if they attempted boarding, in reality Taiwan might be better off demonstrating its willingness to use military force by attacking a few select Chinese ships and then offering China a face-saving off-ramp. Otherwise, the sunk costs of so many destroyed Chinese ships might drive China to escalation that would be difficult for Taiwan to match on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Iteration 3: China Boarding vs. Taiwan Assertive (1x2) Base&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ROCAF and ROCN were able to destroy hundreds of Chinese CCG, MSA, and PAFMM vessels in a few weeks, almost entirely destroying those forces. A few Taiwanese merchants were boarded or damaged early in the campaign, but the number declined to zero by week 3. By this point, the main constraint on trade was acquiring and crewing enough merchants to make the Japan-Taiwan run. As with all off-diagonal dyads, the imbalance of capabilities meant that only one iteration was needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/lvkj1bZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image25&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 5.4: Results Summary (1x2) Base.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS Defense and Security Department.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Losses show the great imbalance in capabilities. Although these Chinese ships were individually small, they were so numerous as to cause significant casualties for China. In turn, Taiwan’s casualties were comparatively light, although not trivial. This is because many CCG ships have been transferred from the PLAN and retain capable armaments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imports plummeted initially due to Chinese boardings but rebuilt gradually as Taiwan cleared out the Chinese forces. Although LNG inventories were quickly depleted—as is the case in nearly all scenarios—followed by the depletion of coal inventories, the steady flow of oil coupled with large initial oil inventories and government-imposed mandatory reductions in usage allowed electricity production to bottom out at 61 percent. Electricity production picked up after 10 weeks, when supplies began to arrive in bulk. By week 14, conditions in Taiwan returned to normal. By week 18, imports were large enough to begin rebuilding coal and LNG inventories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DYAD: CHINA SUBS AND MINES VS. TAIWAN CONSTRAINED (2X1)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dyad pitted Chinese submarines and mines against a constrained Taiwan. Chinese submarines used torpedoes, but China withheld its ASCMs for potential future conflicts rather than using them on defenseless merchants. China conducted covert mining with the PAFMM (versus overt mining of international waters with conventional forces, which would make outside intervention more likely). This allowed China to have a semi-deniable blockade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/oOvlil1.png&quot; alt=&quot;image26&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 5.5: Economic Impacts (1x2) Base.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS Defense and Security Department.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Chinese attempt to blockade Taiwan using submarines and mines would pressure Taiwan to escalate militarily, make concessions, or get the United States to intervene militarily. As another off-diagonal scenario, the relative commitment of forces was imbalanced. Chinese submarines and mines were able to effectively interdict merchant traffic to Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Iteration 4: China Subs and Mines vs. Taiwan Constrained (2x1) Base&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous scenarios where China was only boarding Taiwanese ships, China was now attacking merchants with the intent to sink them. This means that the loss of merchants now resulted in casualties. As with all iterations, this scenario ran for 20 weeks regardless of losses on either side; however, Taiwanese and foreign seafarers might not continue to volunteer to travel on merchant ships that are facing a 50 percent attrition rate. Taiwan—and the United States—would have to quickly decide on escalation or concession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with constraints on the use of ASCMs, Chinese submarines and mines destroyed 59 percent of Taiwanese merchant vessels in the first month of conflict and cumulatively destroyed 387 merchant vessels by the end of 20 weeks. The overall attrition rate per merchant trip ran about 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/mgPnwqR.png&quot; alt=&quot;image27&quot; /&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 5.6: Economic Impacts (2x1) Base.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS Defense and Security Department.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electricity production declined to about 30 percent of demand by week 8 and stayed there. Cargo imports declined to 20 percent and stabilized there. Both levels were insufficient for normal economic functioning. The loss rate of merchant shipping would likely be unsustainable. Taiwan might be able to acquire enough ships on the open market, at the cost of billions of dollars per month, but finding crews would be challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DYAD: CHINA SUBS AND MINES VS. TAIWAN ASSERTIVE (2X2)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dyad pitted Chinese subs and mines against Taiwanese forces that could operate in the exclusion zone. Chinese submarines used basic ASCMs against Taiwanese ships but saved more advanced ASCMs and antiship ballistic missiles for a potential confrontation with the United States. The Taiwanese forces most relevant were the P-3C maritime patrol aircraft (MPA) and larger ROCN vessels equipped with helicopters or ASROCs. Taiwanese merchants transshipped goods from Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All iterations in this dyad saw unsustainable merchant losses for Taiwan. Chinese submarines have advanced both quantitatively and qualitatively past the point where the ROCN could be expected to counter them effectively. In the Base case, merchant losses were high, and the levels of electricity production and imports declined to critical levels by week 12. In the Prepared case, levels of electricity production and imports were adequate throughout, but the merchant losses were immense—over 1,000 vessels. It is unlikely that Taiwan would be able to sustain operations with that much attrition, even with strong willpower. In the “Ukraine strategy” variant, the United States provided aid short of troops (primarily additional ASW weapons), but this made only a small improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, regardless of the specific iterations, there would be strong pressure on Taiwan to make concessions: Unlike in the 1x1 case, there is no further escalation that Taiwan could make on its own. This in turn means that there would be strong escalatory pressures on the United States to intervene with its own military forces, lest Taiwan make substantive concessions to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Iteration 5: China Subs and Mines vs. Taiwan Assertive (2x2) Base&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s ASW capabilities ran out by the second week as all munition inventories were depleted and ROCN ships with antisubmarine capability were sunk. Although Taiwan sank over a half-dozen Chinese submarines, these were mostly the older classes. Even without using their most advanced antiship missiles, Chinese submarines can destroy Taiwan’s frigates and destroyers. Only one Taiwanese ship class has ASROCs. Taiwan’s MPAs inflicted slow and steady attrition on Chinese submarines but ran out of torpedoes (having bought 168 from the United States, and with many torpedoes required to sink Chinese submarines in the deep waters east of Taiwan).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the 2x2 variants, China suffered the fewest casualties in the Base case. However, the losses for Taiwan and China were disproportionate, as there were 11 Taiwan casualties for every China casualty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/arFlC5r.png&quot; alt=&quot;image29&quot; /&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 5.7: Economic Impacts (2x2) Base.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS Defense and Security Department.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imports surged in weeks 5 to 8 as more merchants became available and Taiwanese forces suppressed Chinese submarines, but then imports declined as Taiwan’s ASW effort lost effectiveness and Taiwanese forces were attrited. An assertive Taiwan in the Base case could supply about 80 percent of electricity demand for six weeks, but that fell to one-third by week 10 as Taiwan lost hundreds of merchant ships and most of its navy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Iteration 6: China Subs and Mines vs. Taiwan Assertive (2x2) Prepared&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A prepared Taiwan could sustain electricity production (75 percent) and imports (34 percent at the end of 20 weeks but 94 percent overall) at much higher levels than the Base case if Taiwan were willing to pay the cost (over 1,000 merchants).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The increased inventory of merchant ships available in the Prepared case allowed more ships to make it to Taiwan due to sheer numbers and the operational constraints on China’s submarine force. The constraints arose from the long submarine cycle time. Chinese submarines that survived the initial two weeks until Taiwanese ASW munitions ran out still had to travel to their patrol station, be directed to inbound merchants, get a firing solution, engage, and repeat until they ran out of torpedoes. They then had to travel back to their base on the mainland, reload, refuel, and return to their station. With over 1,200 Taiwanese-owned ships augmented by in-crisis purchases, this gave Taiwan some breathing room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The imbalance of Taiwan’s owned merchant fleet was an obstacle to maintaining steady energy supplies. While general cargo-carrying ships remained plentiful, Taiwan still had insufficient LNG ships (even with the five additional LNG ships bought in the Prepared case and with the purchase of one more LNG ship off the open market). Taiwan’s relative lack of oil-carrying ships also became a problem, although this only manifested by the end of the 20 weeks. The high level of coal and oil inventories along with arrivals sustained electricity production at nearly 100 percent for seven weeks and at about 80 percent thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although imports in the Prepared case ended up at about the same low level as the Base case, they only did so by week 20 compared to week 12. Overall, imports were much higher: 88 percent (Prepared) versus 21 percent (Base). However, by the end of the 20 weeks, Taiwan had only 26 merchants remaining and had lost over $79 billion worth of ships and cargo. Although shipments had sustained Taiwan at a relatively high level, the remaining merchant fleet would have been unable to sustain this for the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Iteration 7: China Subs and Mines vs. Taiwan Assertive (2x2) with Ukraine-Style Aid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This iteration does for Taiwan what the United States has done to support Ukraine in its war against Russia—everything short of directly involving military forces. This would include many things that are not modeled in these military wargames, such as launching diplomatic initiatives and imposing sanctions. Activities affecting the wargames include providing intelligence information from the strategic to the tactical level about the disposition of Chinese forces and transferring ASW weaponry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach had some positive effects: Chinese submarine losses increased from three in the Base case to 13 in this variant, although Taiwan’s ability to fight Chinese submarines was not primarily constrained by munitions but rather by platforms (destroyers, frigates, and MPAs). However, this higher attrition to Chinese submarines did not make a substantial difference in ship arrivals. In comparing these results to the Prepared variant, Taiwan would benefit much more from pre-conflict preparations (e.g., mobilizing all of its owned shipping) than from U.S. arms deliveries during the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imports and electricity production did not change substantially from the Base case. Merchant losses were about the same as in the Base case but half what they were in the Prepared case because the players decided to buy fewer, larger ships in this game than in the Base case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DYAD: CHINA SUBS AND MINES VS. U.S. CONSTRAINED (2X3)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scenario pitted China’s submarines and mines against an assertive Taiwan, with U.S. forces participating but constrained to operations in the exclusion zone. U.S. forces consisted of MPAs (P-8s), nuclear attack submarines, surface combatants, and the T-AGOS ships that are specialized for detecting submarines. China could use advanced antiship missiles against U.S. surface combatants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Constrained U.S. intervention was sufficient to ensure Taiwan’s continued ability to maintain peacetime electrical production in the face of Chinese submarines and mines. This is the scenario posited by Glosny and O’Hanlon. Although “the sea lanes east of Taiwan” might seem large in principle, by focusing on narrow approaches from Japanese territorial waters to Taiwan, the 56,000 km2 east of Taiwan shrinks to approximately 20,000 km2. This is far less than the six million km2 of the North Atlantic covered by the U-boat threat during World War II. The United States also has secure basing for aircraft in Japan, so there is no comparable “Mid-Atlantic gap” within which Chinese submarines would be relatively safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end of the Chinese submarine threat after a month of combat allowed the United States and Taiwan to shift their effort toward countering the PAFMM’s covert mine laying, further mitigating that threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, the escalation risk lies with China, as it loses a large part of its submarine fleet. Because these losses are unseen, however, China could choose to ignore them and simply withdraw from the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Iteration 8: China Subs and Mines vs. U.S. Constrained (2x3) Base&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merchant ship losses were very low because the United States neutralized the Chinese submarines. The price was paid by the coalition antisubmarine forces, whose losses were essentially equal to those of the submarines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s inventories covered the shortfalls in energy imports until China’s submarine threat was neutralized. Once that threat was neutralized, Taiwan achieved 100 percent electricity production from week 7 onwards. Coal and oil inventories never ran out and began rebuilding in week 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DYAD: CHINA OFFSHORE KINETIC VS. TAIWAN ASSERTIVE (3X2)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scenario pitted China conducting operations in the exclusion zone with all its military and nonmilitary assets against Taiwan alone using all its assets. Neither U.S. military assets nor its merchant ships participated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faced with this situation, Taiwan was unable to protect merchant shipping. Taiwan’s warships had very limited capability. Even after organizing the most capable ships into two large mega-surface action groups (SAGs) of 16 ships, each SAG had only 75 medium- and long-range surface-to-air missiles. Many of these were outdated SM-1s. By contrast, a U.S. SAG of three ships has roughly 288 Vertical Launch Systems cells, a majority of which would normally be filled with the most advanced defensive missiles, such as SM-2s, SM-3s, and SM-6s. None of Taiwan’s ships had ballistic missile defense capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that Taiwan would be hopelessly outclassed in this blockade scenario without direct, large-scale intervention by the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Iteration 9: China Offshore Kinetic vs. Taiwan Assertive (3x2) Base&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this iteration, the last of Taiwan’s navy was annihilated while attempting to provide defense for the second convoy (run during week 5). China shot down the last of Taiwan’s MPAs during the fourth convoy run (week 10) and the last of Taiwan’s fighter aircraft during the sixth convoy (week 13). In keeping with the gaming protocol, the game continued for 20 weeks, and a total of nine convoys were run, three of which were entirely unprotected. Taiwanese decisionmakers might be unwilling to do this even if China refrains from escalating to more aggressive tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the high level of Chinese activity, some merchants leaked through the rain of missiles and bombs. Spikes in cargo and electricity production reflect the weeks in which convoys were attempted: The players in this iteration husbanded ships for larger, more infrequent convoys, in contrast with the Chinese escalation 2 scenarios, where convoys were attempted every week. When these large, undefended convoys ran, China was only limited by their ability to destroy merchant ships during their five-hour transit in international waters between Yonaguni and Taiwan. For example, of the 100 merchants that traveled on week 13, 26 ships arrived undamaged off Taiwan. The point is less about the precise numbers of the scenario results and more to underline that, should China want to respect Taiwanese and Japanese territorial waters, it would put itself at serious disadvantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spikes on the chart for electricity production and imports (weeks 5, 8, 10, 13, 17, and 19) reflect convoy arrivals. Overall performance is better than the final snapshot would imply. Convoys kept import and electricity production at about 50 percent on average after week 10, although at immense cost to Taiwan’s military forces and merchant fleet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DYAD: CHINA OFFSHORE KINETIC VS. U.S. CONSTRAINED (3X3)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dyad pitted China’s military forces against U.S. and Taiwanese military forces, with all sides limited to operations in the international waters of the exclusion zone. This “cage fight” produced intense convoy battles. In these convoy battles, the United States and Taiwan kept the island supplied using an increasing number of merchant ships, which became available from the fourth week of conflict. The United States and Taiwan suffered heavy losses in warships and merchants, while China, unable to attack U.S. aircraft at their bases, lost much of its air force in air-to-air combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this dyad, overt fighting between the United States and China would create great escalatory pressures on both sides. On the U.S. side, high casualties would incentivize attacks on Chinese assets outside of the exclusion zone, especially command and control and assets capable of launching missiles, including via aircraft, ships, and transporter erector launchers. For China, U.S. aircraft in Japan would present a lucrative target that, if attacked, would make the blockade much more feasible, albeit at the risk of widening the war. Overall, escalation pressures might weigh more heavily on the United States, as remaining within this dyad enables China to control the pace of fighting. This would be particularly true during the first month of conflict, when China’s long-range missile magazines are deepest and Chinese missile launchers could operate entirely from sanctuary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Iteration 10: China Offshore Kinetic vs. U.S. Constrained (3x3) Base&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 3x3 Base case, the United States’ situational disadvantage at sea was somewhat offset by advantages in the air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of operating in sanctuary for most of the game, the PLA lost only 6 major ships and 18 corvettes. U.S. warships were forced to run the gauntlet to protect convoys, and China put 25 U.S. warships out of action, either sunk or a constructive total loss (CTL).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the United States enjoying an advantage in advanced fighter aircraft and not subject to attack on its bases, U.S. air forces destroyed 684 PLA fighter aircraft over the course of the conflict while losing 206 of its own. The Chinese submarine force inflicted substantial damage on merchants and escorting warships. But to get to operational areas, Chinese submarines had to transit 400 km from China’s coast and were subject to interception and attack by U.S. submarines, convoy escorts, and, in areas close to Taiwan and Japan, MPAs. By the end of 20 weeks, all of China’s 40 operational submarines were destroyed, while only 4 U.S. submarines were sunk. Both sides lost a portion of their MPAs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China inflicted significant losses on convoys, particularly during the early stages of conflict. Overall, 11 percent of the 1,884 merchant ships that departed for Taiwan over the course of 20 weeks were destroyed (sunk or CTL). Losses were particularly heavy at the outset, with the first convoy losing all of its 5 ships and the second losing 8 of its 31 ships (26 percent).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/miREUdX.png&quot; alt=&quot;image39&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 5.11: Results Summary (3x3) Base.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS Defense and Security Department.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S.-escorted convoys delivered sufficient supplies to sustain electrical production at 100 percent of demand for more than half of the 20-week game. Although shipments were relatively inconsistent, the operation of private generators, nuclear power, and renewable sources offset limited inventories during the weeks when convoys were not sent. By week 13, Taiwan’s economy was operating at pre-blockade levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Iteration 11: China Offshore Kinetic vs. U.S. Constrained (3x3) Prepared&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 3x3 Prepared variant showed the value of whole-of-government preparation. The increased number of cargo ships—which are relatively resilient to attack compared to warships—created a major challenge for China. The greater number of ships in convoys, despite suffering heavy losses, was enough to overwhelm the capabilities of a Chinese military that sought to husband its forces in an effort to sustain attacks over a period of months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With more ships available early in the conflict, significantly more convoys were run in this case than in the 3x3 Base (38 convoys compared to 19 convoys over 20 weeks). The number of successful merchant transits was 61 percent higher. Military losses were broadly comparable. China lost 900 fighter aircraft in this scenario (32 percent more than in the 3x3 Base), as well as 48 bombers, in opposing roughly two convoys a week. The United States lost three more ships in this scenario than in the 3x3 Base, in part because it did not elect to employ Taiwanese escorts (a game decision).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5ZpfhzV.png&quot; alt=&quot;image40&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 5.12: Economic Impacts (3x3) Base.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS Defense and Security Department.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blockade barely affects the major metrics of Taiwan’s economy and society. Inventories cover the first three weeks when shipping is disrupted. After that, arrivals keep electricity production and imports at 100 percent. Energy inventories are healthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Iteration 12: China Offshore Kinetic vs. U.S. Constrained (3x3) Japan Out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 3x3 Japan Out scenario, Japanese political decisions precluded the use of Japanese bases for combat operations and ports for transshipment, though it continued to allow the use of bases for support operations. In this scenario, transshipment occurred in Guam and Australia, which are much farther from Taiwan than the Japanese home islands. Because transshipment would also be slower, given both the greater distances and the more limited port capacity of those alternative ports, each transit took twice as long as those in the other 3x3 cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Militarily, the United States was forced to rely on carrier-based aircraft for tactical airpower, since Air Force tactical aircraft flown from Guam or other locations had almost no loiter time around Taiwan, even if they were provided with copious aerial refueling. The ability to fly support missions from Japan was critical, though the scenario would place significant additional strain on many aspects of the force. Only a subset of U.S. Air Force tanker aircraft can be fitted with the centerline or wing-mounted drogue systems necessary to refuel naval aircraft, and those that can do so offload fuel at a rate that is roughly half of their normal rate. MPA aircraft, flying armed combat missions against Chinese submarines, had to transit from Guam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/oB1hd1S.png&quot; alt=&quot;image41&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 5.12: Results Summary (3x3) Prepared.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS Defense and Security Department.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The incentives for Chinese escalation were arguably higher in this scenario than in the 3x3 Base scenario, since Japan’s absence forced the United States to rely on a much smaller set of critical nodes that represented tempting targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, losses to all the combatants were comparable to the Base case. The number of merchant ships lost was slightly higher than in the 3x3 Base scenario, while the number of successful merchant transits was 32 percent lower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared with the base case, imports were roughly the same level, reflecting the coalition’s ability to gather many ships. However, electricity production was much lower, reflecting the difficulty in finding enough LNG tankers to fill the longer pipeline. Natural gas and coal declined as in the Base case. Oil inventories declined in this variant, whereas they increased in the Base case. However, oil inventories never reached zero, so Taiwan’s economy still operated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Iteration 13: China Offshore Kinetic vs. U.S. Constrained (3x3) Enhanced Chinese Missiles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More effective Chinese missiles increased attrition to inbound merchants while reducing Chinese casualties. This variant assumed that Chinese missiles are highly effective in finding and targeting escorting warships within the larger convoy, that China is better able to coordinate its missile brigades and other forces to launch larger salvos, and that its ISR and command and control is effective and flexible enough to tailor weapons employments to changing circumstances in near–real time. After the first such attack, the U.S. team assigned larger escort formations to convoys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/qCKPu8J.png&quot; alt=&quot;image42&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 5.13: Economic Impacts (3x3) Prepared.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS Defense and Security Department.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared with the Base case, this variant saw increased U.S. and Taiwanese military losses and reduced the flow of merchants to Taiwan. Overall, the number of Taiwan-bound ships destroyed (sunk and CTL) increased by 51 percent, from 202 ships in the Base case to 306 in this variant. Of the 1,361 ships that set out for Taiwan in this variant, 80 percent made it to port, of which 4 percent were CTL. These increased Chinese capabilities also reduced Chinese military losses to about half as much as in the Base case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effects on imports are similar to those in the Base case. Imports plummeted initially but began to recover as the coalition’s larger merchant fleet came online and China ran low on missiles and submarines. By about week 12, Taiwan had regained pre-blockade import levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electricity production was much worse than in the Base case. Base case electricity production averaged about 80 percent for the first 13 weeks and then returned to 100 percent. In this iteration, electricity production sank to 70 percent from week 3 to week 5 and then sank further to 60 percent in week 7 when coal inventories ran out. It stayed at that level or a little above through the 20-week period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DYAD: CHINA OFFSHORE KINETIC VS. U.S. WIDER WAR (3X4)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dyad featured Chinese forces confined to the exclusion zone against unconstrained U.S. forces. China was limited to offshore attacks in the exclusion zone, while the United States was less constrained and fought according to a “Wider War” escalation level that allowed attacks on ports and airports in China’s coastal regions. An important corollary of China’s lower escalation level was that Japan’s Self Defense Forces did not themselves participate in combat operations even though Japan allowed use of U.S. bases and transshipment points for military and merchant operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of this scenario show that it would be difficult if not impossible for China to operate successfully without striking bases in Japan in the event that the United States did not show similar restraint against bases in China. From the outset, U.S. bombers could operate from within the region, greatly increasing their sortie rate. With coastal air bases under threat from JASSM-ER salvos, China was forced to keep its aircraft relatively dispersed, with only a modest screen along the coast. U.S. tactical aircraft were then able to achieve air superiority progressively closer to China’s coast (and, ultimately, over coastal areas).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. air and submarine forces focused initially on attacking Chinese warships, which remained at sea continuously (apart from reprovisioning). Despite the efforts of the PLA Air Force and submarine force to protect those ships, the PLAN was effectively destroyed within the first five weeks of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/8Gi72KN.png&quot; alt=&quot;image44&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 5.14: Economic Impacts (3x3) Japan Out.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS Defense and Security Department.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With relatively few LRASMs in the inventory, U.S. aircraft were forced to employ shorter-range weapons against ships at sea, and Chinese aircraft and shipboard surface-to-air missiles claimed about 150 U.S. aircraft, including 12 bombers, during this phase of the conflict. Having destroyed China’s navy, U.S. surface ships, submarines, and aircraft systematically attacked Chinese air bases along the coast using the more numerous land-attack missiles, reattacking whenever additional aircraft were flown into coastal bases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scenario would create high escalatory pressures for China. China would have to either acknowledge failure (which would be more palatable if offered a face-saving off-ramp), or escalate, perhaps striking Guam or U.S. bases in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Iteration 14: China Offshore Kinetic vs. U.S. Wider War (3x4) Base&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Chinese military forces under siege and U.S. forces able to operate in larger numbers, Chinese attacks on merchant convoys were less successful than in most other scenarios. The worst convoy losses occurred early. Of the 17 merchant ships in the first convoy, 13 were destroyed (sunk or CTL). From the fourth to the tenth convoys (weeks 7 to 13), none suffered more than 7 percent losses. No losses occurred after week 13, when all Chinese threats to shipping were effectively neutralized. Of the 2,603 merchant ship sorties that set out for Taiwan during the entire 20-week period, a total of 89 were destroyed (sunk or CTL)—a 3.4 percent loss rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ALiK8ZO.png&quot; alt=&quot;image45&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 5.14: Results Summary (3x3) Enhanced Chinese Missiles.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS Defense and Security Department.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly given the coalition’s stronger position, this iteration was better for Taiwan than the 3x3 Base. Imports regained 100 percent in week 7 during this variant (compared to week 13 in 3x3 Base). Electricity production regained 100 percent and stayed there in week 9 (compared to week 13). Taiwan was able to rebuild its energy inventories to about 80 percent by week 20. This put Taiwan in a strong position if the blockade were to continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DYAD: CHINA WIDER WAR VS. TAIWAN ASSERTIVE (4X2)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dyad pitted unconstrained Chinese forces against Taiwanese forces that could operate in the exclusion zone and escort convoys, but without assistance from the United States. China had the option of bombarding Taiwan itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a viable scenario for Taiwan. China did not even have to resort to direct attacks against Taiwan’s civilian infrastructure, judging that the imbalance of forces allowed it to achieve its objectives without such a step. The obvious imbalance and detrimental effects of U.S. inactivity would put much pressure on the United States to either intervene or accept Taiwan’s acquiescence to Chinese demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/MJDB2Kg.png&quot; alt=&quot;image46&quot; /&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Iteration 15: China Wider War vs. Taiwan Assertive (4x2) Base&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of this iteration were devastating for Taiwan. More than half of its aircraft and warships were destroyed at their bases in the first days of conflict, while the rest were mopped up in the ensuing two weeks. Merchant shipping was then at the mercy of Chinese warships and submarines that pushed well to the east of Taiwan. The United States would face a decision whether to allow this international “bully” to devastate its coalition partner or step in to stabilize the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Convoys were sent in week 2 and week 4. Both were unsuccessful in getting a single ship to Taiwan, after which the effort was abandoned. Due to the unbalanced escalation levels, Taiwan suffered disproportionate losses as the PRC destroyed many Taiwanese ships and aircrafts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the convoys were unsuccessful in reaching Taiwan, natural gas inventories fell to zero quickly and Taiwan’s coal inventories ran out at week 6. Nevertheless, Taiwan was able to continue producing some electricity because China opted not to attack Taiwan’s electrical system (despite having the option to do so). Therefore, at week 8, Taiwan’s energy production stabilized at 24 percent of the demand—a level barely able to sustain emergency services—and remained at this level of output for the remainder of the iteration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DYAD: CHINA WIDER WAR VS. U.S. CONSTRAINED (4X3)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dyad pitted unconstrained Chinese forces against U.S. forces constrained to operations inside the exclusion zone. China had the option of bombarding Taiwan itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/WJyCSPC.png&quot; alt=&quot;image47&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 5.15: Results Summary (3x4) Base.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS Defense and Security Department.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese strikes on Taiwan’s electrical system were devastating, driving electricity production levels below what was experienced in other iterations. The United States suffered heavy losses, including two aircraft carriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scenario would be a shock to the U.S. public and likely engender demands for escalation. This would especially be the case since the United States could not strike many of its Chinese attackers because it was limited to operations in the exclusion zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Iteration 16: China Wider War vs. U.S. Constrained (4x3) Base&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a military perspective, the escalation level neutralized U.S. land-attack capabilities, which are useful in other scenarios for attacking air bases, ports, ISR, and other assets on the mainland. Two consequences followed. First, Chinese air forces were able to crowd into forward coastal air bases without risk of being hit by air strikes. This increased the concentration and range of Chinese airpower. Second, the escalation level greatly improved the survivability of Chinese warships and submarines, which took shelter as needed in ports or other areas immediately offshore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/sbpiqkj.png&quot; alt=&quot;image48&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 5.16: Economic Impacts (3x4) Base.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS Defense and Security Department.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To compensate, the United States delayed the first convoy from week 3 to week 4, thereby allowing more forces to arrive in theater before risking the passage. More importantly, it relied on carrier-based airpower far more than in other scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in all games in which the Chinese escalation level allowed it to hit air bases in Japan, Guam, and Taiwan, such attacks destroyed large numbers of U.S. aircraft on the ground. Moreover, China’s own air force was able to inflict punishment on convoys and maintain or contest air superiority in the areas around Taiwan for the first seven weeks of conflict. Ultimately, the U.S. strategy of spreading risk and employing carriers paid dividends, and the United States was able to equalize and, finally, win the air-to-air fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But unlike the course of other high-end conflict scenarios, China was able to conduct attacks against every convoy through to week 20, though for several weeks at the end, its attacks were entirely conducted by submarines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from suffering heavy military casualties, including 33 surface combatants and two U.S. aircraft carriers destroyed, the United States and Taiwan had more difficulty moving materiel to Taiwan in this scenario. The total number of merchant ship sorties that reached Taiwan in this iteration, 1,584, was 9 percent smaller than the total that reached Taiwan in the 4x4 Base. The 153 merchant ships that were destroyed (sunk or CTL) were some 56 percent greater than the 4x4 Base scenario. These numbers do not include more lightly damaged ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cargo imports returned to pre-blockade levels at week 11 and stayed there until the end of the iteration. Conversely, because of China’s continuing attacks on the electrical system, electricity levels fell to zero in week 5 and did not rise above 10 percent of pre-blockade levels for the remainder of the game. This low level of electricity production—a result of China’s attacks on Taiwan’s energy infrastructure—meant not just economic collapse but also the failure to meet even minimal health and safety activities for the population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Iteration 17: China Wider War vs. U.S. Constrained (4x3) Hardened&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this iteration, China again attacked Taiwan’s electrical system. When that happened in the Base case, the effects were devastating. This iteration, therefore, explored the value of hardening the electrical system. The Hardened case assumed that each ton of Chinese munitions did half as much damage as in the Base case and that Taiwan could repair damage at twice the rate of the Base case. As a result, electricity production was far higher. In the Base case, electricity production was zero in both the worst week and week 20. In this Hardened case, the worst week was 47 percent and week 20 was 100 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of this bombardment and its effect on electricity production, the Hardened case was identical to the Base case, with the same ship losses, aircraft losses, personnel casualties, ship arrivals, and imports because nothing changed in terms of warfighting parameters. Thus, this iteration does not have a separate results summary table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, this iteration has Figure 5.19, which contrasts electricity production in the Hardened versus unhardened (Base) cases. In the Hardened case, electricity production dipped initially, as in the unhardened Base case, but recovered over time. The unhardened case did not have enough recovery capability to get ahead of China’s continuing attacks. Whereas the average level in the Base case was about 10 percent, it was about 75 percent in the Hardened case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that hardening the electrical system makes a huge difference. Even if the assumptions of this analysis are overly optimistic about what hardening can accomplish, the effort is worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DYAD: CHINA WIDER WAR VS. U.S. WIDER WAR (4X4)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this dyad, both sides used all their conventional forces without constraints on geography or targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were two elements to this campaign: (1) a series of convoy battles that resembled those of previous scenarios, and (2) a larger conflict in which both sides sought to destroy the relevant military assets of the other. The convoy battle inevitably put U.S. ships at risk long before the antiship threat was neutralized, but it also divided Chinese attention and resources. Sinking merchant ships required large salvos of missiles that might, in a high-level conflict like this, be allocated instead against U.S. warships. In this dyad, both sides’ ability to attack air bases proved important in forcing the other side to maintain a modicum of dispersion in depth, thereby limiting the potential of tactical airpower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this represented the top of the conventional escalation ladder, there were few further steps to take. One side might implement a strategy that looked like regime change, for example, by attacking the adversary’s leadership. Otherwise, the next escalation step would be to the nuclear realm, which involves an entirely different set of considerations. For this project’s purposes, the scenario was run for 20 weeks at high intensity, though one or both combatants would likely move to a guerre de course (by, for example, rationing attacks to continue operations beyond 20 weeks) or exit the conflict prior to that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the lower-level scenarios illustrate, there are strong military and political incentives for either conflict resolution or escalation toward wider war. Thus, the full-war scenario is highly likely if off-ramps are not found sooner in the escalation process. From an operational perspective, the U.S. military might prefer this scenario to a limited convoy battle, as it would give U.S. planners more control over events and an ability to strike back freely instead of simply sending ships through a shooting gallery. This Wider War scenario demonstrated a plausible path to U.S. success (defined as keeping Taiwan supplied at a relatively high level) and the destruction of China’s air and naval capability. However, Taiwan’s position was often precarious for the first 5 to 10 weeks, and success came with high losses that U.S. political leaders would need to accept as they continued operations to the point of final success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Iteration 18: China Wider War vs. U.S. Wider War (4x4) Base&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, China was less effective in sinking merchant ships when it was forced to engage in a broader war. The first convoy, sent in week 3, suffered losses of 53 percent (sunk and CTL). The following six convoys, sent between weeks 5 and 10, suffered 24 percent losses on average, while subsequent convoys were effectively unmolested. Overall, merchant ships suffered losses of 5 percent (sunk and CTL) of the 1,808 ships that departed for Taiwan, a loss rate that was half that suffered in the 3x3 Base case (limited war convoy battle).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The improvement in merchant fortunes came at the cost of a much wider and more destructive war in which military losses on both sides were high. For the first weeks of the conflict, China’s land-attack missiles deterred the U.S. command from bringing large numbers of aircraft to Japan. China subsequently launched periodic attacks on those bases until its inventory of long-range munitions was exhausted. Following China’s use of long-range antiship missiles (particularly the DF-26B) to sink a U.S. carrier early in the conflict, the U.S. Navy decided against bringing additional full-sized carriers into striking distance for the remainder of the game. Instead, the U.S. team restricted sea-based airpower to two “lightning carriers” (America-class amphibious assault ships loaded with aircraft instead of infantry), which the United States may regard as more expendable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9kt0FWq.png&quot; alt=&quot;image54&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 5.18: Results Summary (4x4) Base.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS Defense and Security Department.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. submarines and ASCM-equipped aircraft kept Chinese surface ships largely bottled up in port, where they served as floating missile batteries but were vulnerable to U.S. land-attack fires. The rate of attrition against the Chinese surface fleet in port was steady but slower than it would have been had they remained at sea and vulnerable to submarines and coalition ASCMs. U.S. submarines were themselves at risk until China’s nascent fleet of MPAs was destroyed by missile attack on their bases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the course of the conflict, U.S. bombers launched large salvos of long-range missiles (e.g., JASSM-ERs and JASSMs), and warships and submarines fired salvos of Tomahawks to gradually attrit Chinese ISR, airpower, air defenses, and ships in port. China responded with antiship missiles against the SAGs. Like the Chinese threat to U.S. air bases, however, this was an uneven battle. With Chinese ships pinned in port, the number of Chinese antiship missiles that could range U.S. SAGs beyond 1,000 km was far smaller than the number of land-attack missiles that the U.S. Navy and Air Force could employ against ports and air bases. Both sides conducted strikes with tactical airpower, with China more active during the early stages and the United States becoming dominant later in the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in other higher-end scenarios, a United States that was willing to sustain heavy losses translated into relatively stable deliveries to Taiwan. After the opening month of fighting, and especially once China began to exhaust its long-range munitions, deliveries of cargo and key energy supplies returned to pre-blockade levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/0uGqIKI.png&quot; alt=&quot;image55&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 5.20: Economic Impacts (4x4) Base.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS Defense and Security Department.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the problem now was that Chinese bombardment of Taiwanese energy infrastructure limited Taiwanese recovery. Despite sufficient energy inventories, Taiwan’s energy production had not recovered even by the end of the 20 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Iteration 19: China Wider War vs. U.S. Wider War (4x4) Prepared&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 4x4 Wider War Prepared variant explored the potential impact of U.S. and Taiwanese peacetime preparations, including the ability to quickly assemble a large group of merchant ships for convoy operations in the event of conflict. Not surprisingly, this produced a major improvement in the amount of shipping that arrived safely in Taiwan. Although the impact was seen throughout the duration of the conflict, the most important gains were at the outset of conflict—during the initial weeks when very little shipping succeeded in reaching Taiwan in the 4x4 Base scenario. Whereas only one convoy ran during the first four weeks of the Base case (with 8 merchant ships reaching Taiwan), in the Prepared scenario, six convoys were run during the same period (with 389 merchant ships reaching Taiwan).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the 5,752 merchant ship sorties over the entire 20-week period, 171 were destroyed (sunk or CTL)—a loss rate of about 3 percent. The highest loss rate in any given week was 21 percent. While overall merchant losses were higher in absolute terms than in the Base case, the percentage lost was lower—and 2.6 times as many ships succeeded in making the passage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military losses for both sides were roughly comparable to those suffered under the 4x4 Base case. A generally more aggressive China team in this iteration led to slightly higher casualties on both sides. As in the Base case, China’s ability to strike U.S. air bases in Japan largely offset U.S. advantages in other areas, especially early in the conflict. The United States employed a wide variety of platforms and missiles to force China to disperse its aircraft in depth. As in the invasion scenario covered by the First Battle report, the U.S. shortage of long-range antiship missiles limited the attrition rate against China’s fleet, but U.S. submarines and, eventually, airpower succeeded in blunting the PLAN’s considerable ship-launched missile forces. The relatively large loss of U.S. submarines reflects their campaign against both Chinese surface ships and Chinese submarines. The additional supplies, particularly early in the war, would give authorities on Taiwan and in Washington far more leeway in decisionmaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/I2y5jLD.png&quot; alt=&quot;image56&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 5.19: Results Summary (4x4) Prepared.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS Defense and Security Department.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the iteration, U.S.-escorted convoys suffered losses week to week while traveling to Taiwan’s ports; however, cargo levels dropped below pre-blockade demand only during week 2 and 3. Oil and coal inventories stayed above pre-blockade levels for most of the iteration. Natural gas inventories, alternatively, dropped to zero in the early weeks of the game and then rose to 200 percent of pre-blockade levels for the remainder of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, the limiting factor for Taiwanese energy production was the status of energy infrastructure. Increasing energy deliveries resulted in healthy stockpiles that could not be used in an electrical grid degraded by bombing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Iteration 20: China Wider War vs. U.S. Wider War (4x4) Prepared + Hardened&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hardened electrical system produced a higher level of electricity production (worst week: 73 percent) than both the Base (worst week: 13 percent) and Prepared cases (worst week: 21 percent). Indeed, the electricity production level returned to pre-blockade levels, unlike any other iteration where China bombarded Taiwan’s electrical system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 5.22 shows electricity production in a hardened (iteration 20) and unhardened (iteration 19) system. In this iteration, China’s attacks on the electrical system were not as severe as in the 4x3 scenarios (iterations 16 and 17) So both hardened and unhardened could recover. However, the hardened system had returned to 100 percent by week 9. The unhardened system had only reached 78 percent by week 20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/tPkmEDK.png&quot; alt=&quot;image58&quot; /&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Iteration 21: China Wider War vs. U.S. Wider War (4x4) Enhanced Chinese Missiles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A variant of the Wider War scenario is one in which Chinese antiship missile capabilities are better than in the Base case. Specifically, this variant assumed that Chinese missiles are highly effective in finding and targeting escorting warships within the larger convoy, that China is better able to coordinate its missile brigades and other forces to launch larger salvos, and that its ISR and command and control is sufficiently adept to target warships first and then attack cargo ships. In this case (as in the 3x3 Enhanced Chinese Missiles variant), the results did change somewhat. The U.S. team held the second convoy back but prosecuted a more aggressive strategy to attrit Chinese forces faster. Compared with the Base case, merchant arrivals were about the same, but merchant ship losses were up about 50 percent (94 versus 145). Chinese losses were the same, and Taiwanese and Japanese losses were down about 10 percent. The big change was the increase in U.S. losses, up nearly 400 aircraft (45 percent). During the conflict, the United States lost a total of 14 squadrons of tankers and 43 squadrons of fighters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Energy inventories fared relatively well. Although natural gas and coal declined to zero, both started to rebuild as a result of robust deliveries from U.S. escorted convoys, coal in week 11 and natural gas in week 16. The problem was that China’s attacks on electricity production prevented energy arrivals and inventories from being fully used. Electricity production levels, though gradually recovering after week 10, did not get above 50 percent until week 17 and ended week 20 at 80 percent. Without the attacks, electricity production would have been at about 100 percent in week 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cargo import levels, which were not affected by Chinese attacks, returned to pre-blockade levels at week 12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;free-play-games&quot;&gt;Free-Play Games&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted earlier, free-play games did not lock the players into particular escalation levels; instead, players could increase escalation, decrease escalation, or explore an off-ramp. Although the 50 participants in these games were experienced professionals, many with expertise related to their country team, it cannot be known whether their decisions would reflect those of real-world decisionmakers. Nevertheless, the results give useful insights into escalation dynamics. The games also show how variable results can be when different groups face the same problem and why multiple game iterations are needed to illuminate the range of possible decisions and outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In two of five free-play iterations, the teams escalated to the highest level of violence. This resulted in heavy casualties to both sides.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In two other games, the teams found or discussed off-ramps. The form of coalition concessions ranged from symbolic (agreeing to hold bilateral talks) to substantive (ceding offshore islands). Of note, when Taiwanese citizens played on the Taiwan team, they were unwilling to discuss concessions to China.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In all games but one, there was a reluctance to escalate. (In the exception, China struck Taiwan early and hard.) Instead, teams tried to maintain their current escalation level. Often, they made small escalations to respond to a perceived escalation and send a signal. However, these escalations sometimes produced counter-escalations all the way up the escalation ladder.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Signaling with actions was often misunderstood. To be effective, signals had to be accompanied by direct or indirect communication.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In all the iterations, naval forces exchanged fire and inflicted casualties.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Attacks on homelands were highly variable, as Table 5.21 shows. In one iteration, Taiwan, China, Japan, and Guam were all struck. In another, Taiwan, China, and Guam were struck but not Japan. In two others, Taiwan or its islands were struck but no other countries were. In one iteration, no homeland was struck.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tables below summarize the five game iterations. Appendix I (forthcoming) contains turn-by-turn descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;FREE-PLAY GAME 1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This game featured rapid escalation between China and the United States, ending with strikes on each other’s territory and major losses on both sides. Coalition personnel casualties (20,634) were much heavier than China’s (3,620) because of the need to push convoys through to Taiwan while under attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/MgSBXQp.png&quot; alt=&quot;image62&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 5.22: Free-Play Game 1 Results Summary.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS Defense and Security Department.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this game, China began with a fire strike that destroyed a major part of the ROCAF and ROCN. China expanded these strikes to Taiwan’s energy system. The United States responded by escorting convoys from Japan to Taiwan. U.S. antiship missile forces landed on Taiwan, but then the United States halted convoys for a week due to high losses. The United States also attacked Chinese airfields with missiles from ships and bombers. In response, China attacked bases on Guam and Japan. When China attacked U.S. bases in Japan, Japan entered the conflict and provided additional convoy escorts. Most U.S. aircraft losses occurred on the ground in these strikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;FREE-PLAY GAME 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This game also featured rapid escalation between the United States and China, resulting in an unrestricted conventional level of escalation on both sides. Unlike in the first game, Japan remained largely uninvolved beyond providing light convoy assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Sbck81o.png&quot; alt=&quot;image63&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 5.23: Free-Play Game 2 Results Summary.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS Defense and Security Department.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game began with the United States and Taiwan escorting a convoy that skirmished with Chinese forces. The skirmish escalated into a full-scale convoy battle. China launched a mass missile attack on Taiwan, destroying large parts of the ROCAF, ROCN, and ground-based ASCMs. China also attacked Guam. In week 4, China launched a missile attack on U.S. and Japan Self-Defense Forces aircraft on Japan. Japan took defensive actions only, and convoy battles continued throughout. China landed forces on Penghu Island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S./coalition personnel losses greatly exceeded those of China because of China’s airfield attacks. However, Taiwan’s energy and import levels remained high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;FREE-PLAY GAME 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this game, the United States and Japan focused on economic attacks on China rather than military attacks. The game still featured combat, but direct conflict remained solely between China and Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan formed convoys, and China intercepted them with the CCG. Fighting escalated to a full convoy battle but was limited to the CCG and Taiwan’s military forces. The United States refused to provide forces for convoy escort. Instead, it imposed a distant blockade on Chinese shipping, implementing a board and seizure operation at key straits such as Malacca and Sunda. The United States also airlifted military supplies into Taiwan. During week 4, three U.S. transport aircraft were destroyed on the tarmac in Taiwan. Meanwhile, the United States prepared to escalate horizontally by striking Chinese infrastructure near the Suez Canal, Panama Canal, and Singapore. Japan stayed neutral throughout, not allowing military operations from its territory or transshipment from its ports, but it did participate in sanctions and freezing Chinese assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S./coalition casualties were much lower than in games 1 and 2, but electricity production and import levels were also much lower. This would be a contest of endurance between Taiwan and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;FREE-PLAY GAME 4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This game featured escalation directly followed by de-escalation and ceasefire negotiations between China and Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/m75H1eB.png&quot; alt=&quot;image65&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 5.25: Free-Play Game 4 Results Summary.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS Defense and Security Department.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This game began with Japan sending ships with humanitarian supplies to Taiwan, escorted by the Taiwanese navy; China interdicted them. The United States sent a Patriot battery and advisers to Taiwan, attacked Chinese ships with aircraft, and hunted Chinese submarines. Fighting escalated to full-scale convoy battles involving U.S., Taiwanese, and Chinese forces. China reached out to Taiwan to propose a deal, demanding that the Taiwanese president step down and U.S. forces leave Taiwan in exchange for the end of the blockade. Gameplay ended before a final settlement was reached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The de-escalation resulted in fewer casualties than in games 1, 2, and 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;FREE-PLAY GAME 5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last free-play game also featured escalation, which was resolved by an arrangement in which Japan and China would jointly escort Taiwanese merchant ships into Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ttm3RpW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image66&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 5.26: Free-Play Game 5 Results Summary.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS Defense and Security Department.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this game, China began by occupying Taiwan’s outlying islands of Quemoy/Kinmen and Matsu and deploying mines. The United States and Taiwan responded with convoys, which China attacked. The United States, Japan, and Taiwan arranged for additional merchant shipping, both mobilized and purchased. Japan organized Japanese-flagged ships for convoys with humanitarian aid. China attacked a humanitarian convoy. The United States and Japan reinforced Okinawa and Kyushu. Convoy battles took place between China on one side and the United States, Japan, and Taiwan on the other. The battles led to negotiations between China, Taiwan, and Japan, and ultimately an agreement for convoys to Taiwan to be escorted jointly by China and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the ceasefire agreement, this game produced the least casualties overall, about 500; at the other extreme, free-play game 1 produced 13,000 casualties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-recommendations-and-conclusion&quot;&gt;Policy Recommendations and Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter lays out recommendations arising from analysis of the wargame results described in the previous chapter. The recommendations are divided into four groups: (1) preparing the merchant fleets, (2) preparing Taiwan’s energy infrastructure, (3) preparing the United States to assist Taiwan during a blockade, and (4) actions for countering and ending a blockade, were one to occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These recommendations have three goals. The first is to enhance deterrence by showing China that Taiwan and the United States are prepared and cannot be intimidated. The recommended actions would do this by raising the potential cost to China, as well as increasing the likelihood that a conflict would be long, hard, and unsuccessful. The second is to prepare for faster and more effective action in an emergency. Although plans can be developed on the fly, that takes time, which may not be available in a crisis. The third is to discourage other countries from pressuring Taiwan to submit because they hope that a quick resolution would restart the flow of semiconductors. The United States and Taiwan want to be clear that any encouragement of China would be worse for the global economy, in both the near and long term, than supporting Taiwan in its autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the event a blockade does occur, these actions may not necessarily thwart the blockade outright, but they would buy time. Time is critical because it allows Taiwan’s supporters, like the United States, to build diplomatic coalitions and put pressure on China to cease coercive action. It also allows the United States to prepare its forces in case military action is needed. Prior planning and preparation—the main theme of these recommendations—would therefore decrease escalatory pressures and strengthen deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;prepare-the-merchant-fleets&quot;&gt;Prepare the Merchant Fleets&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because countering a blockade would primarily involve a maritime fight with outcomes determined largely by the number and type of merchant ships that arrive on Taiwan, the most important area for pre-conflict preparations involves measures to increase the availability of merchant ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Arrange for mobilization of Taiwanese-owned shipping.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In Prepared variants where Taiwan was able to mobilize its owned ships (in addition to ships flagged to Taiwan), the increased number of available merchants greatly eased escalatory pressures. Additional merchants also make China’s task more difficult; China is more likely to run out of antiship munitions if it has to attack more targets.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Taiwan should ensure that all ships whose beneficial owners are Taiwanese are legally subject to requisition with appropriate compensation when ordered by the government. The Legislative Yuan should be prepared to implement requisitioning immediately after blockade begins—before owners might sell or otherwise dispose of ships. Taiwan should also require the contracts of Taiwanese seafarers to stipulate that they would be required to serve at the government’s behest during times of national emergency and establish incentives for non-Taiwanese seafarers to similarly continue their service.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Contract LNG tankers into the Tanker Security Program (TSP) and a Taiwanese equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s energy supply depends heavily on imported LNG, and in all of the scenarios, natural gas inventories invariably run out long before coal and oil. However, as the data in Module 1 show, there are few LNG tankers that Taiwan or the United States could acquire quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Both the United States (through the U.S. Maritime Administration, or MARAD) and Taiwan should buy or contract for LNG tankers. Today’s depressed market for LNG tankers creates an opportunity. This would provide a low-cost but highly visible demonstration of both countries’ commitment to resist coercion. As far back as 2022, Taiwan’s Maritime and Port Bureau suggested the country needs to build a national fleet of up to 16 LNG tankers, so this is not a new proposal.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;For the United States, securing LNG tankers would be relatively straightforward since MARAD already maintains two mechanisms for doing this. One is the ready reserve fleet. Although that fleet is intended to support military operations, adding a few LNG tankers to hedge against a blockade would be a modest expansion of the program. The number required would be small, and a contested blockade would meet the statutory requirements that the ships be used for “national defense or military purposes in time of war or national emergency.” The other is the TSP, which currently contracts tankers to support military operations but could be expanded to include LNG tankers. The statutory language seems to allow such an expansion under “national defense and other security requirements.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Taiwan would need to establish a similar, small program with perhaps only five LNG carriers, enough to provide one week of Taiwan’s LNG requirements. These tankers would bridge the gap as Taiwan’s LNG inventory runs out and before Taiwan is able to acquire LNG tankers from other sources, such as reflagged vessels and purchases on the open market after conflict begins.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make plans for managing war risk in the commercial sector.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As discussed in Chapter 2, commercial shipping companies are risk averse and will avoid sending ships into combat zones without compensation. Insurance rates will rise, perhaps to astronomical levels, in any sort of blockade. Moreover, virtually all maritime insurance includes a “five powers clause” that excludes losses resulting from war between the United Kingdom, United States, France, Russia, and China. Special financial structures will thus be needed to allow the operation of shuttle merchants. Crews will also need incentives.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In an emergency, both Taiwan and the United States will need to replace or supplement commercial insurance with guarantees, subsidies, or reinsurance to keep maritime and air traffic flowing. There are precedents for this in both world wars. The legal and administrative requirements of such preparation should not be underestimated, and the foundations must be established during peacetime so they are ready in an emergency. Although Taiwan would be expected to take the initial steps in these areas, the United States should be prepared to step in with its larger financial resources.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plan for transshipment via Japan, Guam, and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The most important factor to the throughput of Taiwan’s merchant fleet during a blockade is the ability to use Japanese harbors to transship goods. The ships involved in global trade are not the same ones that would make an opposed run into Taiwan. Japan is preferable as a transshipment point because it is closer to Taiwan and has excellent port facilities. Guam is a potential fallback, but it is farther away than Japan and has limited port capacity that would already be in high demand during a conflict. Australia has significantly more capacity than Guam but is farther still from both Taiwan and other trade partners and routes. However, it could provide coal, gas, food, and assorted other supplies from its own resources.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Coordination between Taiwan, the United States, Japan, and Australia on transshipping is critical. Infrastructure in Japan should be surveyed for its amenability for use in transshipment. For a transshipment point to be operational in an operationally relevant timeframe, Japan would have to authorize such use in the first hours or days of a conflict. Pre-conflict planning for transshipment via Japan would be provocative to China and thus politically sensitive in Japan, so it should be done quietly. Transshipping might be introduced in Japan as one element of contribution to alliance security in the Western Pacific. Similar discussions should be held with Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;prepare-taiwans-energy-infrastructure&quot;&gt;Prepare Taiwan’s Energy Infrastructure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Energy is the weakest element in Taiwan’s resilience against coercion. The overwhelming preponderance of energy must be imported and would thus be vulnerable to a blockade. This is not a new observation; every analysis of Taiwan blockade scenarios highlights this vulnerability. Although Taiwan has already taken measures to mitigate the problem, more remains to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Increase Taiwanese energy reserves.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As a result of laws mandating large inventories, Taiwan’s energy reserves are substantial for a country without any significant domestic energy resources. Taiwan’s oil reserves, at 146 days of consumption, far surpass that of the United States and the European Union, which have 21 days and 69 days, respectively. Its natural gas (11–12 days) and coal reserves (40–42 days) are lower than those of the United States and the European Union, which both have substantial production, which engenders large “in process” inventories. The United States has 29 days of natural gas reserves and 83 days of coal reserves, while the European Union has 63 days and 6 days, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, these inventories are inadequate for meeting Taiwan’s electricity demands in most of the scenarios studied.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;One obvious approach is to expand inventories. The Prepared scenarios hypothesized such an expansion before a conflict. This could come from building additional storage facilities or filling the existing logistics chains on the island.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Building additional storage facilities requires new tanks for natural gas and oil and specialized storage yards for coal. The advantage of building and filling new storage is that the inventories are always available. The disadvantage is cost. Not only do these facilities need to be constructed, but there is also the carrying cost of maintaining additional inventory. For oil and natural gas, there is the additional risk of attack on these storage facilities if a blockade becomes kinetic. Natural gas poses unique problems, as it requires refrigeration to -260 degrees Fahrenheit (-162 degrees Celsius) or very high-pressure containers. Natural gas also experiences continuous evaporation as some liquified gas turns into vapor. This requires active management and may not be viable.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;For oil, building tanks underground is attractive for survivability, but these have the potential to become an environmental nightmare due to the risk of leakage in the near term or long term. After the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States built extensive underground fuel tanks there. These are now leaking. The Navy is spending nearly $2 billion to drain and clean the old tanks and faces lawsuits about environmental damage and health effects from seepage. Underground tanks would therefore need to meet high environmental standards.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Alternatively, Taiwan could take advantage of the fact that international crises often develop over weeks or even months. Taiwan’s energy system could top off centralized storage facilities and those of distributors and customers, thus using all available storage to the maximum extent. This would require a government directive early in a crisis to start the process while there is still time.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The advantage is that peacetime costs would be relatively low. The chief disadvantage is timing. Filling all the storage facilities would require additional ship deliveries and take some time. A blockade could occur while the plan was still being put into action. A second disadvantage is persuading the supply chain to accept additional deliveries. The government might have to provide incentives for energy users and suppliers to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maintain and expand resilient energy sources.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Over time, Taiwan has shifted its sources of energy from coal and nuclear to natural gas and renewables for environmental reasons. However, this has greatly increased Taiwan’s energy vulnerability. As noted above, natural gas poses several storage problems, and continuous resupply is needed. Solar and wind power do not depend on imports but are intermittent. Hydro sources are excellent, but Taiwan is running out of locations to install additional capacity at economical rates. In contrast, nuclear power provides the ultimate energy resilience because it can run continuously and without significant imports through any blockade. Coal has the advantage that it can be stored indefinitely and in large quantities, though it poses environmental hazards.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Building energy resilience is difficult both politically and environmentally. Nevertheless, Taiwan cannot ignore the connection between energy sources and national security. Nuclear power could provide an immediate gain. Taiwan should consider reopening its last nuclear plant rather than continuing its closure as currently planned. It should certainly investigate new forms of nuclear power plants, which might not only provide resilience but also save Taiwan from having to pay other countries $60 billion per year for energy imports. The siting flexibility and fast build-speed of small modular reactors make that option particularly appealing for Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Instead of converting from coal to natural gas and then, in the future, to renewable sources, Taiwan might skip the first conversion and wait for more renewables to come online. This would ensure that more plants could continue to operate in case of a temporary cessation of maritime traffic to Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Harden energy infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Direct attacks on an adversary’s electrical system have occurred in every conflict of the last century. China might take this escalation step later in a campaign if other blockade actions were not producing the desired result, or it might pursue such an action immediately to produce a “shock and awe” effect. Wargaming showed that such attacks would be devastating if conducted in volume and sustained over weeks. Conversely, a hardened and resilient system could continue to operate at acceptable levels.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Taiwan has done a lot to make its electrical system more resilient in the face of extreme weather conditions. More hardening is needed for national security reasons. The additional resilience would not only reduce hardship on the population in the event of Chinese missile attacks but would also strengthen deterrence by reducing pre-attack estimates of the effectiveness of those attacks. Making China’s task more difficult adds to deterrence. These actions have the added benefit of engendering more reliable utilities in peacetime.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Taiwan should also build additional dual-fuel plants or adapt an existing plant for dual-use in an emergency. Taiwan has recognized LNG as a security vulnerability; allowing LNG plants to use more easily stockpiled diesel would mitigate this. This also provides flexibility in both peacetime and conflict, allowing electricity generation to continue with a wider variety of fuel deliveries. Replacement turbines, transformers, and other critical spare parts should be stockpiled in peacetime, as these might be targeted during a Chinese bombardment and replacements might not otherwise be available.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Expand plans for allocating resources on Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Even under the best of circumstances, shipping would be in short supply during a blockade, and space onboard those ships would be scarce. There will inevitably be competition for that space. Normally, space would go to the highest bidder. However, the highest bidder might not prioritize the goods necessary for national survival. As described in the discussion about Module 3, energy, health and emergency supplies, and chip production should be the top priorities. Consumer goods and construction materials should be lowest.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;To ensure the most effective response during an emergency, the government will need to control imports to ensure they prioritize the most critical items and distribute these for greatest effect. Without an allocation process, import priorities will become a free-for-all, with the most powerful and well connected getting what they need and others being left out. This will undermine the legitimacy of resistance as well as be inefficient, with resources going to lower-priority activities. Taiwan should build on its existing plans for allocating imports during a blockade and develop decision criteria for how to use inventories. Additional steps might include planning for rationing food, fuel, and certain consumer products.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Countries at war have always had some government allocation and rationing process. In World War II, the United States had the Office of Production Management, which was replaced by the more powerful War Production Board in January 1942. The United Kingdom had the Ministry of Production, and Nazi Germany had the Ministry of Armaments. A Taiwan equivalent would need sunset provisions, lest it hang on after the conflict and undermine Taiwan’s free enterprise system.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The government has many ways to prepare the population and send the message to China that “we can overcome any attack.” For example, the government could have educational materials ready to help the population. For energy, this would cover the voluntary and mandatory reductions discussed earlier as well as establishing a standby rationing system, should supplies fall substantially. For food, it could include instructions on how to build a “victory garden.” The United States encouraged these in World War II, and unlike with some symbolic actions like scrap metal drives, home food production had a significant economic impact by replacing half of vegetable and fruit production. Taiwan already has a volunteer training system to build on.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;prepare-contingency-plans-for-the-united-states-to-assist-taiwan-during-a-blockade&quot;&gt;Prepare Contingency Plans for the United States to Assist Taiwan During a Blockade&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most scenarios, Taiwan cannot face China alone. While Taiwan can prevail in a scenario that pits the Taiwanese military against Chinese nonmilitary boarding parties, China will prevail in all other Taiwan versus China scenarios. In those scenarios, Taiwan needs U.S. assistance, likely in direct combat operations, if it is to remain autonomous and democratic. If the United States wants to retain the option of continuing an autonomous and democratic Taiwan in the face of a Chinese blockade, then it needs to have plans ready to support Taiwan at a variety of blockade levels. These preparations would aid deterrence against China by making the prospects of a successful blockade seem less likely, and as contingency plans, they are entirely consistent with the policy of strategic ambiguity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rebuild skills and prepare contingency plans to conduct convoys during a blockade.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Conducting convoys is a basic naval task, but the U.S. Navy is out of practice because convoys have not been a priority mission since the end of the Cold War. Deprioritizing was appropriate for the immediate post–Cold War era, when prospective adversaries had weak naval fleets. It is not appropriate for the current great power era, where prospective adversaries like China can threaten shipping far out into the global commons. With the exception of LNG tankers (as discussed earlier), the United States has enough merchant ships in the National Defense Reserve Fleet (NDRF), accessible through the Voluntary Intermodal Sealift Agreement (VISA), and from other programs; however, it lacks the wartime tools to recruit crews.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The United States cannot wait weeks or months for the U.S. Navy to develop convoy procedures while a blockade is squeezing the economic life out of Taiwan. It must act swiftly once the president directs action. The experience in World War II is a warning. The Navy was slow to adopt convoys, generating heavy costs. U-boats sank 240 cargo ships on the eastern seaboard from January to June 1942 before the United States established a convoy system. Japan never developed an effective convoy system and paid a terrible price.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The United States therefore needs to develop plans for conducting convoys:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Navy has recently focused attention on contested logistics, and convoys should be part of that larger effort. For example, it would be worthwhile to conduct some convoy exercises in the western Pacific to renew these skills and signal U.S. resolve. These should be done with allies and partners and characterized as ensuring freedom of navigation and the open use of international waters, so they are not perceived internationally as provocative.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;U.S. Transportation Command (TRANSCOM) and Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) should have a plan for where mobilized merchant ships will go and a plan for the operation of convoys to Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;MARAD, in conjunction with TRANSCOM, needs a plan for recruiting crews to operate mobilized shipping in a war zone. One possibility is to revive the U.S. Maritime Service of World War II, but there are many other possible approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make joint plans with allies and partners, especially Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Access to the U.S. bases in the region, particularly in Japan, is critical at all levels of escalation in wargame scenarios. At the lower levels, the bases provide home ports for U.S. reconnaissance assets and minesweepers when the United States decides to intervene. In convoy battles, the ports provide secure staging areas for convoy formation. At high levels of escalation, Japan provides airfields close enough to Taiwan and conflict areas that U.S. fighter aircraft could enter the fight; additionally, the Japan Self-Defense Forces are a valuable ally.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Because there is no alliance structure in Asia comparable to NATO, arrangements must be mostly bilateral. For the same reason, the United States cannot turn leadership over to another organization or country. Other countries will help Taiwan only if the United States does. (See Appendix F, forthcoming, for a country-by-country analysis of what allies and partners might provide to counter a Chinese blockade of Taiwan.)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;If the United States regards competition with China and the defense of Taiwan as its top military priorities, then it needs to align its other policies, such as trade and demands for host-nation support, with that priority. Otherwise, it may find that allies and partners hang back in the hour of crisis, having been alienated by their prewar treatment and having developed doubts about U.S. reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make contingency plans for an airlift and military resupply of Taiwan while recognizing their severe limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Some experts think of the Berlin Airlift and the Ukrainian aid mission when faced with the problem of supporting an isolated ally or partner without engaging in direct combat. Both efforts arguably succeeded. However, when applied to Taiwan, neither provides more than an emergency stopgap. They are not viable strategies for dealing with a Taiwan being blockaded by China.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, in some circumstances, an airlift could have a powerful moral effect and provide some breathing room. In all the project’s free-play and unrestricted warfare games, the U.S. team either considered or implemented an airlift. In free-play games, this sometimes created dilemmas for the China teams at lower levels of escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;TRANSCOM and INDOPACOM need to develop an operational plan for an airlift into Taiwan. TRANSCOM has a history of being able to respond rapidly in crises, so this is just an extension of its long-standing expertise. However, the scale of such an airlift would be unprecedented in recent history. Airlift planning will need to examine all the relevant airfields and estimate what would be needed for the high level of operations in forward locations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;prepare-to-counter-and-end-a-blockade&quot;&gt;Prepare to Counter and End a Blockade&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although deterrence is the first goal for Taiwan and the United States, China may nevertheless launch a blockade. This section describes actions that the United States and Taiwan might take during a blockade to thwart its intentions and mitigate damage to Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do not treat a blockade like an invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A blockade is a different challenge than an invasion. In invasion scenarios, China must be committed to use all of its conventional military forces and escalate to high levels from day one. The U.S. response therefore has to be similarly forward leaning, requiring U.S. forces to engage in direct combat against Chinese forces almost immediately, lest China rapidly occupy Taiwan and end the conflict before the United States can bring its military power to bear.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In contrast, the success or failure of a blockade depends on whether Taiwan accedes to Chinese demands. There are many scenarios where China could hold some or even most of its military forces in reserve, escalating only if its political goals were not met. A blockade therefore has more in common with the coercive dialogue typical of nuclear scenarios than with an invasion. In these scenarios, both sides have unused military force that they would prefer not to use if they could get a satisfactory diplomatic resolution: Therefore, finding off-ramps that secure key coalition goals yet provide China with a face-saving exit are critical. Total military victory is unachievable.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;U.S. authorities should not react to a Chinese blockade in the same way that they would react to an invasion attempt. Separate plans are required for these scenarios because plans for countering a blockade would diverge in important ways from war plans to counter an invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;While some immediate actions would be required due to their long lead times (e.g., activating VISA, implementing plans for transshipping in Japan, and alerting forces for possible deployment), direct military action against Chinese forces could wait for a week or two if that allows diplomatic and military coalitions to be built. This is particularly true because an extended blockade is a poor prelude to invasion. This operational patience by the United States would ensure China’s diplomatic isolation, set up negotiations for a ceasefire, and, if necessary, prepare a coalition military response.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provide Beijing with off-ramps.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A blockade would be a risky strategy for China. While political circumstances might make it appear an attractive and flexible option, it could easily produce a political and diplomatic disaster. The Berlin blockade was catastrophic for the Soviet Union. The Berlin Airlift’s success showed what concerted military action could do. As a direct result of the blockade’s challenge and the airlift’s success, both the Federal Republic of Germany and NATO came into being.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A failed Chinese blockade might have similar effects. Squeezing Taiwan into submission could take a long time; it might fail outright, especially if the United States and its coalition are willing to contest the blockade actively. As China’s blockade was squeezing Taiwan, China’s own economy would be suffering from foreign capital flight and the disruption of its trade.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Further, a blockade would inflict suffering on civilians, kill seafarers and service members, destroy shipping, and disrupt the global trade on which many countries depend. This could undermine China’s efforts to make itself an attractive alternative to U.S. regional leadership and potentially drive regional states toward the United States. Faced with the prospect of disastrous failure, China might escalate, with all the risks involved, but it would also consider off-ramps if they were available.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Creative offers by the United States and Taiwan might allow China to declare victory and lift the blockade at an acceptable cost to the coalition (e.g., Taiwan agreeing to international observers in customs houses; reiterating the 1992 Consensus verbatim). Developing a menu of offers and responses ahead of a conflict would greatly help the process of finding a mutually agreeable off-ramp during a conflict. In two of five in-person games, teams looked for off-ramps to avoid a destructive conflict. These can be developed from pre-conflict wargames, analyses, and exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This needs to be done in conjunction with allies and partners, especially Taiwan and Japan. If they are not on board, the effect will collapse.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project is the third in a series that this team has done on China’s threat to Taiwan. Along with one-off wargames for organizations such as the Naval War College and Business Executives for National Security, these projects have run over 70 wargame iterations covering dozens of scenarios. These provide a broad view of what might happen in a U.S.-China conflict over Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first project, The First Battle of the Next War: Wargaming a Chinese Invasion of Taiwan, looked at invasion. It concluded that the United States and its coalition partners could maintain an autonomous and democratic Taiwan, but at a high cost. It recommended a variety of actions to enhance deterrence, build strength, and abet warfighting, if conflict should break out. These measures included fortifying air bases, acquiring more antiship missiles, deepening diplomatic and military ties with Japan, and recognizing the need to continue operations in the face of heavy casualties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second wargaming project, Confronting Armageddon: Wargaming Nuclear Deterrence and Its Failures in a U.S.-China Conflict over Taiwan, used the same basic methodology but added the possibility of each side using nuclear weapons. It concluded that the greatest pressure to use nuclear weapons came when China was facing conventional military defeat. There was a high risk of escalation to general nuclear war. The project recommended against the United States acquiring more nuclear weapons beyond the planned modernization; rather, what was most important was the development of off-ramps for China to take in lieu of nuclear escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many common elements in the recommendations across the three projects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even successful campaigns exact heavy casualties. This will be a shock in the United States, which since the end of the Cold War has been accustomed to fighting wars with few personnel or weapons losses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Off-ramps are valuable because total victory is unachievable when both sides have secure homelands and nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strong military forces and determined policies strengthen deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Military operational planning needs to include all these many scenarios. Planning is a tool for better senior-level decisionmaking, not a statement of intent to fight a war.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Above all, the unexpected can happen. Although war with China is unlikely, it is not impossible, and unlikely events occur. Preparation is therefore vital.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also important differences. In high-intensity conflicts where China decides to attack U.S. air bases, most U.S. aircraft losses occur on the ground. In the invasion project, that raised questions about the value of pursuing advanced fighter aircraft if so many were lost on the ground and could not use their advanced capabilities. In blockade scenarios where China did not attack air bases, more U.S. aircraft survived and had more kills against Chinese aircraft in air-to-air combat. For example, in free-play games 1 and 2, which escalated to high intensity, the United States lost five to seven times as many aircraft as China, mostly from ground attack. In the 3x3 dyad games, the ratios were reversed, with the United States inflicting two to three times as many aircraft losses on China as it suffered itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although nearly all blockade scenarios had significant personnel casualties, these were generally much lower than in a typical invasion scenario. Total personnel losses, including all countries, did not reach the 10,000 level until the 3x3 scenarios. Even then, the main reason for the disparity is that ground forces were not in contact in a blockade, and ground combat is the major driver of casualties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also some tensions. Preparing for a high-intensity conflict will drive Taiwan to adopt a porcupine strategy that relies heavily on defensive systems like ground-based antiship missiles, ground-based air defenses, and sea mines. Countering blockades below the high-intensity level requires surface ships, aircraft, and some offensive capabilities. In high-intensity conflicts, the United States needs to pull its surface fleet back and minimize massing aircraft on bases inside China’s missile range. In most blockade scenarios, surface ships need to be forward deployed to operate as convoy escorts, and aircraft need forward bases to maximize time on station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Evan Montgomery and Toshi Yoshihara, two experts at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, point out, “As the side looking to overturn the status quo, Beijing can already choose when to strike. But it can also choose how to strike. That means Washington cannot afford to focus too closely on one particular threat, even as it cannot take its eye off the invasion ball.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the United States and its coalition must be prepared to deter and, if necessary, fight a wide range of scenarios. There is no magic bullet that can bring success across all scenarios. Instead, success requires a deep toolbox of capabilities. While some tools are useful across many scenarios, others are needed, even vital, in only a few. All are needed for credible deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia-Iran ties are complex and do not fit neatly into simplified IR categories. Andrei Kortunov notes that while Russia and Iran share a broad opposition to Western influence in the Middle East, in practice “the balance of common, overlapping and diverging interests between Russia and Iran is far more complex than it appears to those who are fond of simplified geopolitical constructs.” However, analysts have struggled to describe it other than by placing it somewhere in between these very “constructs.” Kortunov himself suggests that claims of a strategic partnership are far too strong and that, at best, ties between Moscow and Teheran can be characterized as closer to a “tactical alliance between countries with diverging foreign policy aspirations and ambitions.” Nicole Grajewski argues that “Russia-Iran relations are best understood as a tenuous partnership that oscillates between ‘strategic’ and ‘tactical’ cooperation on common security issues despite long-lasting mistrust, unmet expectations and weak economic ties.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from military cooperation after the Russians invaded Ukraine in 2022, which the Iranians tend to minimize or deny altogether, bilateral ties have always been limited, with limited cultural and social links and little success in boosting economic links. Russia and Iran do have a track record of effective cooperation in regional diplomacy, such as on the Caspian Sea and the two countries’ overlapping reactions to major conflicts in the greater Middle East, including the Tajik civil war in the 1990s and Afghanistan from the 1990s onward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper looks at the political and diplomatic relationship between Russia and Iran in the wake of the Syrian civil war, treating it as a litmus test of the nature of the relationship. The Syrian war offers plenty of material for such a study, given its preeminence for 13 years and the fact that Iran’s and Russia’s strong presence on the ground there offered unique opportunities for directly interviewing some of their officials involved. This article provides new empirical data from interviews with key participants to provide more detailed data on how the Russia-Iran relationship evolved on the ground in the conflict during 2016-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper therefore seeks to answer two main questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a) What drove the divergence between Iran and Russia;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b) How did Russia and Iran seek to manage their diverging aims?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper is organized into three main sections. The first outlines the state of Russia-Iran relations before Russia’s intervention in Syria and in the early months of it. The second section identifies and discusses each of the drivers of the Russia-Iran divergence, while the third looks at how Russia and Iran sought to manage them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researching this topic has required a number of methodological compromises, given that conducting primary research in Syria was extremely difficult until 2024. There are other obvious limitations to the research methodology adopted, with the research, by necessity, mostly limited to oral sources, with support from the literature and news reports but without access to primary written sources: the body of data collected is inevitably incomplete, gaps abound, and following up on specific themes was often impossible. The analysis contained in the paper inevitably reflects this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the oral sources proved to be quite approachable. The risk inherent in this type of research is therefore not obtaining access. There are other risks, however: that interviewees might be affected by a social-desirability bias, resulting in overstating their achievements, capabilities and/or resources; or by reverse causation, leading sources to provide prejudiced information about rival organizations. Mitigation measures are discussed below. The research methodology was a hybrid of investigative journalism and ethnographic interviews. The questionnaires were adapted to each interviewee; there were, in fact, as many different questionnaires as there were interviews. The questions evolved as knowledge of ongoing trends and developments expanded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the researchers have a background in journalism and/or research, had participated in previous research projects with a similar typology of interviewees and have been trained to undertake research with a similar methodology. The interviews were commissioned to local researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The risk that respondents might use the interviews to influence external observers or misrepresent the facts was assumed from the start. It was mitigated by using different types of interviewees – such as government officials and military officers, Iranian and Russian officers and diplomats, members of militias – who represented contrasting points of view; by interviewing individuals separately and without their being aware of other interviews taking place; and by inserting questions to which the answer was already known, in order to verify responses. It proved particularly helpful to present interviewees with information gathered from other sources. Public-domain sources, such as media reports and analytical studies, were also used, where available, to check the credibility of interviewees. Researchers were chosen who did not know each other to avoid the risk of researcher collusion to manipulate the content of interviews, for example, by inventing content to produce whatever they might have believed the project team wanted to hear. This is always a risk when interviews are carried out by field researchers in a project that is being managed remotely. The field researchers were informed that the purpose of the effort was simply to ascertain facts and that there was no premium placed on specific findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interviewees were told that their answers would be used in an open-access publication, the type of which was not specified. The interviews were in part carried out face-to-face and in part over the phone – some interviewees were in locations that were difficult to access. All the interviews have been anonymized and all data that could lead to the identification of interviewees has been removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 38 interviews were held in 2016-24 with senior Syrian government officials (11), armed forces and intelligence officers (8), mid-ranking members of militias (4), Iranian diplomats and IRGC and Iranian army officers (13), and Russian diplomats (2). Cooperation of those contacted for interviews was surprisingly forthcoming as most interviewees were keen to reflect on our questions in detail, even when they touched on highly contentious themes. We cross-checked, contextualized and supplemented interviews inside Syria through a number of interviews with Russian analysts, as well as media reporting and work by colleagues in academia and think tanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;from-tactical-to-strategic-alliance&quot;&gt;From tactical to strategic alliance?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grajewski argues that the transactional relationship between Russia and Iran mutated into a much deeper relationship because of the Syrian war. That indeed seemed to be the case in early 2016. This section shows what took the countries’ leaderships to that point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russia-iran-relations-before-the-syrian-civil-war&quot;&gt;Russia-Iran relations before the Syrian civil war&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scholars and analysts of Russia-Iran relations can be broadly divided into three groups. One group tends to argue that the strategic relationship between Iran and Russia has been getting closer. The Russian version of this view is that Russia and Iran are natural strategic partners. Another group argues that the two countries are essentially rivals in disguise. A third contends that Russia has a tactical, transactional relationship with Iran, with an overarching strategic strand in the relationship that can be characterized as alignment. Russia-Iran ties, in the third view, are therefore best understood as a form of “competitive alignment,” in which an overarching framework of relations managed by political leaders on both sides contain numerous competitive dynamics that work themselves out on the ground inside areas of conflict, such as Syria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As early as the late 1980s, Iran started looking at better relations with the Soviet Union and Russia as a way to counterbalance US hostility. Iran showed its understanding for Moscow’s war in Chechnya and cooperated with Russia in finding a solution to the Tajik civil war. Long before the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 was to drive an intensification of military sales and military/technological cooperation between the two countries, in the 1990s Russian arms sales to Iran had started picking up, and Russia even sold a nuclear power station to Iran. This led some US officials to speak of a “a full-fledged defense partnership.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the two countries competed in the Caspian Sea, and in 1995-2000 Russia agreed with the US to limit nuclear cooperation with Iran. Later, Russia agreed to freeze the sale of advanced weaponry to Iran. Russia’s cooperation with OPEC countries to manipulate oil prices, to Iran’s detriment, was another contentious point that emerged regularly. Typical Iranian complaints about the Russians include criticism of Moscow’s sense of superiority. Russian shifts in relations with Iran, which continued until 2016, raised substantial doubts in Teheran that the Russians were using Iran as a bargaining chip with the Americans. More broadly, within the Iranian leadership concerns existed about the risk of becoming too dependent on Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russians, on the other hand, were often frustrated by Iranian intransigence while negotiating over their nuclear program. However, especially after the failure of President Mohammad Khatami to break the ice with Washington,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Although Tehran is far from placing absolute trust in Moscow, […] the precedent of relative continuity in their relations has left powerful factions within Iran’s security establishment with the impression that Russia is more predictable than the West.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, once Mahmoud Ahmadinejad took power as president in Iran in 2005, relations gradually improved. Under his presidency, Russia was not worried that Iran would drift toward the West. Fluctuations in the relationship continued to occur. When Russia remained isolated from the West following its annexation of Crimea and Iran signed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with the Obama administration, it seemed that the tables might be about to turn and that Iran would gravitate toward the West. However, in the end under Hassan Rouhani, Russia and Iran remained close, not least because of the start of the war in Syria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russias-and-irans-investment-in-syria&quot;&gt;Russia’s and Iran’s investment in Syria&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It did not take long after its start in 2011 for the Syrian civil war to emerge as a very serious challenge, initially for Iran but soon for Russia as well. Cooperation between the two countries on Syria started getting closer in 2012, as Russia, opposed to regime change and worried about its Tartus naval base, lent diplomatic support to Iran and Syria, especially in the wake of Syria’s alleged use of chemical weapons in 2013. The Russians also started sharing intelligence. By 2014, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was calling Iran a “natural ally.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The loss of Idlib in spring 2015 raised the fear that the opposition could overwhelm even Latakia and the coastal region, including Russia’s base in Tartus, and neither the Iranians nor their allies believed they were in a position to prevent that. (Intensifying Turkish support for opposition groups was in part responsible for this development.) At the same time, the rise of ISIS increased the pressure on the Assad regime in parts of western and eastern Syria, while also dragging the US into the conflict and resulting in the creation of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). This prompted the Iranians to seek Russia’s direct intervention. For Russia too, intervention in Syria made more and more sense, not just to protect its own interests there, but also as a way to tie Iran more closely to itself and prevent any westward drift by Teheran, like the one that occurred in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is not possible here to describe in any detail the enormous challenges faced by the Assad regime after 2011, the degree to which Iran and Russia considered the situation extremely serious is well borne out by the amount of financial and human resources that they committed to supporting the regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2014, Russia provided at least €240 million to Syria, but this was just the beginning. By 2017, Russia was reportedly contributing $200 million a month in support of the regime, or half of the $400 million per month that a Syrian government official estimated in 2017 the war was costing Syria. By spring 2017, according to a Syrian government source, Russia had already paid $7.2 billion to Syria, to which £3 billion of grants for weapon purchases should be added. At the peak of the war, in 2016-17, Russia was reportedly spending around $2.5 billion per year to support the Syrian regime. In 2022-23, Russia still provided a total of $3 billion in financial support. It is unclear to what extent economic aid and financial support was in the form of grants or of loans. The latter appear to be more likely. We do know that in 2015, the regime obtained a $3 billion loan from Russia. Other loans followed later. Moreover, Syria is believed to owe between $30 billion and $50 billion to Iran and Russia together as of 2025, which suggests that it was receiving mostly loans. Even before the regime collapse in December 2024, these loans were clearly at risk of never being paid back (also taking into account Syria’s past record of failing to repay debts), so the Russians might well have lumped loans and grants together as “support.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran, by contrast, had provided $4.4 billion in aid by May 2017, on top of the $6-8 billion it was directly spending in Syria annually. The following year, Ali Akbar Velayati, senior foreign affairs advisor to the supreme leader, stated that Teheran was providing $8 billion a year to ensure the Syrian regime’s survival. An Iranian MP claimed that Syria owed Iran around $30 billion at the end of 2024, suggesting that the overall financial commitment of Iran was even higher than Russia’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With regard to human resources, on the eve of Russia’s intervention, in October 2015, external sources estimated IRGC forces in Syria at 7,000. This is close to what Iranian sources also reported. As of January 2016, the IRGC reportedly had 6,500 men in Syria, according to an Iranian army officer. A month later, an IRGC source put the number at 9,000, noting that the number was increasing, because the “Syrian army is not good at fighting.” In April 2018, however, another IRGC source mentioned that after the April 2018 missile strikes against Syria, plans were being drafted to increase the number of IRGC personnel to 7,000 and that of the Iranian army in Syria, until then quite low, to 20,000. The 9,000 figure may therefore have included Iranian army forces, which were present in relatively modest numbers. Interestingly, Israeli intelligence estimates were more modest, at 2,500 IRGC and army personnel in late 2015 and declining afterward, to reach 1,000 in spring 2017. By 2019, an Iranian source put at 2,300 the overall number of Iranian servicemen who had lost their lives in Syria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exact numbers of Russian forces deployed in Syria for military operations have never been made public. Russia already had a presence in Tartus at its naval base and had to send several hundred air force personnel to fly and service the combat planes it deployed. Michael Kofman and Matthew Rojansky estimated the number of ground troops at 3,000. As of July 2017, according to a Syrian official, Russia had 671 advisers in Syria, 326 more than a year earlier. Their numbers reportedly kept increasing afterward, and they even started being deployed to the front line. Military contractors took the brunt of frontline operations and correspondingly took heavier casualties. Total losses were reported to be up to 197 servicemen and 346 military contractors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;irans-and-russias-apparent-honeymoon-in-syria&quot;&gt;Iran’s and Russia’s apparent honeymoon in Syria&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no question, therefore, that the Syrian civil war shaped up as a crucial test of the relationship between Russia and Iran. For the first time, they confronted a major challenge to a key ally together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia and Iran started getting closer in 2014, and in October 2014 they signed a memorandum of understanding on fighting terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikolai Patrushev, the head of [the] National Security Council and a close aide of Putin, stated that “Iran has been one of Russia’s key partners in the region, and it will remain so in future” after meeting with his counterpart Ali Shamkhani.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a Hezbollah newspaper, the first agreement featuring battlefield cooperation between Russia, Iran and Iraq was reached around September 2014. Reportedly, the first Russian military delegation arrived in Syria at this point, to assess the military needs. On September 30, 2015, Russia finally deployed military forces on the Syrian battlefield, primarily its air force, supported by protection units, some special forces units, trainers and advisors, and military contractors tasked, among other things, with supporting Syrian units on the front line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, the Russian intervention seemed on the surface to be welcome by both Teheran and Damascus. Nobody within the Assad regime denied that the Russian intervention and especially the Russian air campaign dramatically boosted the Assad regime’s fortunes. The same largely applies to the Iranians too, be it support from the IRGC or army. An IRGC colonel commented that “The Russian air strikes helped a lot in the current political situation.” An Iranian army general commented in early 2016 that the Russian airstrikes “are matching our targets 100%, there are no contrast or differences.” “It was Russian air strikes that are making the opposition start peace negotiations,” he said. It is worth noting that, at that time, the Iranian general did not seem to view negotiations with the opposition as something negative, but as an achievement. Around the same time, an IRGC commander assessed that “Rebel groups like Al Nusra, Al Sham are ready to start peace talks with Bashar al-Assad’s government.” In sum, as external observers commented, in Syria the alignment of Russian and Iranian interests was “unprecedented.” The Syrian crisis undoubtedly allowed Russia and Iran to make a qualitative upgrade of their relations toward a military partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon, however, it started becoming clear that the alignment was far from complete. There were lingering doubts over Russia’s long-term aims. Another Iranian fear was that Russia’s intervention in Syria could be “a way of controlling Iran’s links to Europe, helping the Russian state-owned energy company Gazprom to continue its dominance of European energy supplies.” There were also serious shorter-term diverging interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russia-iran-divergence-in-syria&quot;&gt;Russia-Iran divergence in Syria&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the surface, Iran’s and Russia’s aims in Syria diverged from the start, even if the respective leaderships thought that differences would be manageable. From the beginning of Russia’s direct involvement, according to Dmitri Trenin, Russia felt “uncomfortable with this alliance with Shiite power.” Yezid Sayegh similarly pointed out that some degree of competition between Russia and Iran existed in Syria from the start, although it never reached the stage of a “comprehensive competition.” Off the record, two IRGC sources in early 2016 did not hide that they rejected any prospect of a ceasefire and talks with the opposition until the war was essentially won, and the armed opposition reduced to a marginal role. This was in clear opposition to Russia’s aim of granting a significant share of power to elements of the opposition (see Reconciliation and peace talks below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common attitude in Moscow seemed to be characterizing the relationship with Teheran more as marriage of convenience than a strategic alliance, with “a high level of suspicion and mistrust between the two sides.” Some observers, however, still believed that Moscow saw Iran as a useful partner and a stable actor, a functioning state that could advance Russian interests on the ground in Syria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even in the early stages of Russia’s intervention in Syria, some incidents revealed to external observers tension beneath the surface. A case in point was Iran’s granting access to its Shahid Nojeh air base to Russia to facilitate an air bridge to Syria – that lasted one week before Iran annulled the agreement because Russia had publicized the fact in public statements. The Iranians felt that Russia’s use of the air base undermined Iran’s image of independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;tensions-intensify-starting-in-2017&quot;&gt;Tensions intensify starting in 2017&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already by the end of 2016, an IRGC colonel acknowledged that cooperation with Russia was in decline. In March 2017, an Iranian diplomat too noted the same trend:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Before, Iran and Russia were consulting each other before taking action, but now, unfortunately, they are not consulting with us, and Russia is taking actions without informing us. Russia distanced itself from us when they established relations with Türkiye and the new Trump administration.[…] We told them if you do anything, you should consult with us.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2018, signs of divergence and disagreement started intensifying. As the Syrian armed opposition was marginalized, the Russians and Iranians started needing each other much less, and competition between them increased. The competition for influence aside, it became increasingly clear that Iran’s and Russia’s strategic aims were different. Opinion among external observers remained nonetheless divided about how serious the Russia-Iran divergence was from 2018 onward. For its part, the Syrian regime openly complained about the two allies pushing it in opposite directions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can group the major points of diplomatic divergence between Iran and Russia into two main issues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The approach toward a political solution (including with the Kurds) and the fact that the Russians did not see the need to keep Assad in power at all costs; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Iran’s determination to consolidate its long-term military and political presence in Syria, especially within the context of its ongoing confrontation with Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at each of these points of divergence in detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reconciliation-and-peace-talks&quot;&gt;Reconciliation and peace talks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Iran’s initial endorsement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russians were already trying to promote reconciliation before they intervened in Syria at the end of 2015. After the situation in the Ukrainian Donbas stabilized, the Russians organized meetings between opposition groups and regime representatives in January and April 2015. At the same time, efforts by the Gulf monarchies to persuade Moscow to dump Assad were going on. Although formally Damascus and Teheran endorsed the Russian diplomatic efforts, there were reports that both capitals were concerned about the possibility of Moscow making a deal behind their back. Before intervening directly in Syria, Putin invited Assad to Moscow, reportedly to make sure that he would buy into Moscow’s idea of a political settlement, which involved making the regime more inclusive. Perhaps to gain leverage, the Russians also publicly signaled that keeping Assad in power was not essential to them, to the chagrin of the Iranians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, as the Iranians were encouraging Moscow to intervene, they initially had to endorse the Russian approach of negotiations. At the top of the Islamic Republic there was a strong majority in favor of Russian intervention. Velayati, with the full endorsement of Khamenei, expressed support for Russia’s views on a negotiated settlement of the Syrian conflict in November 2015. Parliamentary speaker Ali Larijani was then speaking of Russia as a priority partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, even in those early stages, the actual Russian intervention ended up irritating “the traditional supporters of Tehran’s active role in the Syrian crisis – Iranian radical conservatives and IRGC members.”These tensions were reflected in Iran’s media, which started expressing the fear that Russian air power could make the Syrian regime forget about all Iran had done for the survival of the regime, hence compromising Iran’s long-term position in Syria. The fear that the Russians might make a deal with the Gulf monarchies in exchange for investments by them was also clearly expressed in the media. According to Nikolay Kozhanov,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;These people believe that [the] immense military efforts made by Tehran in support of the Assad regime bought the Iranian authorities the right to decide the destiny of Syria. Indeed, Iran deployed its military advisors and special forces in Syria long before Putin’s decision to send Russian troops to Syria. Tehran’s proxies (such as Lebanese Hizbollah and Shia militia) were the first to come to the aid of Assad, as well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The IRGC’s approach: Negotiations only after military victory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the abovementioned jealousy toward Russia’s growing influence in Syria, the real driver especially of IRGC opposition to Russia’s plans for negotiations was the objection to incorporating opposition groups into power to any substantial degree, which would have been the case if agreements had been signed before those groups were defeated militarily. The Russians wanted to concentrate the military effort against Daesh and Al Nusra, but the Iranians insisted on the need of destroying all opposition groups. For the Iranians, a political solution was possible only if the sponsors of the opposition (especially Saudi Arabia and the US) stopped supporting it, implying that they were ready to deal only with a dramatically weakened opposition, starved of resources. While Moscow positioned itself as a “third side” in the conflict and was “flirting” with the moderate opposition, the Iranians positioned themselves as the staunchly loyal ally of the regime. The IRGC position was summed up well by an IRGC colonel:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[We] are telling them that if we solve the problems by fighting, this will solve them permanently, but if the problems are solved through negotiations, they will start again.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were also tensions among different Iranian state agencies. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs was closer to Russia’s position. According to an Iranian diplomat, Foreign Minister Mohammad Zarif was a genuine advocate of a peace settlement and was supported by President Rouhani, also because Zarif was trying to maintain or improve Iran’s relations with Türkiye and Russia. By early 2017, the Iranians were looking to be able to achieve complete victory in Syria within 2-3 years, thanks in part to the collapse of IS in Iraq. In the view of Zarif, according to an Iranian diplomat, that would allow Syria to return to the status quo ante of 2011, except that Assad would leave power, to be replaced by another Ba’athist, and the government would become more representative of the population, incorporating more Sunni Arabs and some Kurds. This was quite close to Russia’s view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Zarif’s participation in the 2015 Vienna talks was criticized by the IRGC, which argued for a military victory as the only solution to the conflict. Four IRGC sources stated bluntly that the IRGC was able to veto anything Zarif might want to agree to. IRGC and the Iranian MoD believed instead in a complete military solution. The diplomat admitted that the IRGC would always prevail over the MoFA. The dominance of the IRGC (endorsed by Khamenei, who actually controlled the entire Syrian portfolio) was highlighted in early 2019, when during Assad’s visit to Teheran, Zarif was left out of the process and did not take part in any meeting. Zarif resigned, but Rouhani refused to accept his resignation. Clearly, Khamenei meant to snub Zarif.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, even within the usually more moderate Iranian MoFA there were different views: one diplomat viewed the prospects of peace in terms similar to the IRGC, rejecting negotiations and arguing that Iran had not sacrificed so much for just peace talks. According to a senior official in Damascus, even the Iranian ambassador to Syria, Jawad Turk Abadi, was close to the IRGC and reportedly answered to IRGC head Mohammad Jafari more than to the MoFA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ceasefires were seen by the IRGC merely as opportunities for the opposition to recover and reorganize. When Assad, with the support of Ali Mamlouk, nonetheless tasked General Qais Al Farwah of the Republican Guard to pursue reconciliation with opposition groups in the Damascus area, the Iranians started spreading rumors that the general was distributing weapons to the opposition, trying to discredit him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s military combined counterinsurgency operations with local truces and talks to persuade opponents to change sides or to evacuate strategic areas. The IRGC, however, opposed even local reconciliation deals, where small commanders either gave up fighting or agreed to fight on the government’s side, arguing that these commanders reconciled only because they had issues with their leaders or because they were cut off from supplies, meaning they could not be trusted in the long term. Moreover, the number of small commanders reconciling would never be such as to have a significant impact on the conflict. A commander of the Iran-trained and -funded Fatimiyun militia acknowledged that the first ceasefire agreed between Russia and Türkiye was more effective than previous ones, because Türkiye played a role in enforcing it among opposition groups. However, this commander opposed ceasefires on the ground, arguing that the Turks only wanted their proxies in Syria to recover strength after the defeat in Aleppo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A senior official in Damascus confirmed that in 2017, the Iranians were bringing heavy pressure on the Syrian government to violate the Russia-sponsored ceasefires with opposition groups, including with chemical attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The chemical attack that took place in Idlib was done because of Iran bringing pressure on General Issam Hallaq to perform it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a Syrian official, the Russians complained about the gas attacks by Syrian forces, fully aware that these were going to seriously hurt Russian efforts to make progress in reconciliation talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Assad’s future&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moscow was skeptical of Assad from the start. Moscow criticized the initial repression of the protests in 2011-12 and, in June 2013, Putin openly criticized Assad for not having undertaken any reforms before the revolt. Putin clearly said that he was worried about Assad doing the “Sadat turn of alliances.” Some interpreted these comments as a nod to Arab countries, as removing Assad from power was a major red line for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2017, it was painfully clear to all in Damascus and to the Iranians that the Russians were quite serious about looking for a replacement for Assad. The rumors were that Rami Makhlouf, Hassan Abdullah Noori (a candidate in the 2014 election), Maher al Assad and former foreign minister and vice president Farouk al Sharaa were being considered as alternatives. The Iranians opposed all these options, according to a senior Syrian source, but reportedly indicated that they could tolerate somebody like Abdullah al Ahmar (a senior Ba’ath politician) in the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toward the end of 2017, the Russians made quite an effort sponsoring Farouk al Sharaa as a replacement for Assad, to be the head of a transitional government. The transitional government was meant to allow for reconciliation talks and eventually for elections within three years. Born in 1938, al Sharaa was an elderly Syrian diplomat of Sunni background, former deputy foreign minister, former minister of information and former vice president who had fallen out with Assad. He was also reportedly supported by Bashar’s brother, Maher al Assad, and by dignitaries of the regime such as Ali Mamluk, Ali Turkmani, foreign minister Walid Muallen and several others. Maher al Assad supported al Sharaa due to his own poor relations with his brother and to his own good relationship with Russia. Al Sharaa’s supporters in Syria and in Russia believed that he would be acceptable to the Kurds, as well as to many Sunni Arabs, including at least some opposition groups. Because al Sharaa had fled to Jordan, he was also seen positively in Jordan itself and in Saudi Arabia, UAE, Türkiye and Europe, and possibly the US too. Bashir al Assad of course bitterly opposed the plan. The Syrian military by and large was also opposed. Russia’s approach was bound to meet Iranian opposition, and indeed it ended up going nowhere (see How to keep Assad in power below). Iran’s opposition was so obvious that one wonders whether the Russians really expected their proposal to succeed, or whether they were just posturing to strengthen their credibility with their Arab interlocutors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Russia’s exploration of a settlement with the Kurds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fostering reconciliation between Damascus and the Syrian Kurds was part of Moscow’s plans, which included some form of Kurdish autonomy. The Iranians, on the issue of Kurdish autonomy, were instead aligned with the Turks, who bitterly opposed it. According to an IRGC adviser, the Turkish authorities did engage with the Iranians once to get them to lobby the Russians to drop their support for the Kurds. The Iranians also complained to the Russians for their own reasons and even clashed with Kurdish forces, but they met a stern Russian reply:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Russia told Iran, “You must not do such things because they are against Daesh.” They said that “If you do such things, we will stop support with you.” We are not supporting you to engage in tribal fighting, we are helping you here to finish off Al Nusra. Leave them alone because they are helping us to finish off Daesh.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Iranians sometimes went as far as to deny that the Kurds had played a useful role against Daesh, as an army general interviewed in January 2016 claimed, and were highlighting the risk of weakening Syria’s central government with any concession of autonomy to the Kurds, despite their own demands for devolution to the Shi’as. An IRGC source, while acknowledging the role of the Kurds against Daesh, openly stated that Iran would support a Syrian armed campaign against them if they eventually refused to fully accept Assad’s authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2018, the Russians were nonetheless decreasing their support for the Kurdish militias, although they did not suspend funding altogether. Reportedly, this reduction was a result of an agreement with the Turkish government according to which Türkiye would stop supporting some anti-Assad groups and Russia would stop supporting Kurdish groups. Before reaching their agreement with the Turks over Idlib in 2017, the Russians were lobbying the Syrian Kurdish militias to accept Russian protection and negotiate a power-sharing deal with the Assad regime. Thus, the Kurdish issue lost importance as a bone of contention between Russia and Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russias-and-irans-regional-diplomacies&quot;&gt;Russia’s and Iran’s regional diplomacies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Arab ambitions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the short and medium term, Russia’s strategy of using the leverage gained with its direct intervention to gain diplomatic traction seemed to work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moscow was able to draw the U.S. and the UN into multiple ceasefire deals, each ostensibly a building block toward implementing UNSCR 2254, without demonstrating any serious ability to force Assad to uphold them. The U.S. and Europe repeatedly accepted these superficial attempts to reduce the violence in Syria.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russians aimed at establishing themselves as the leading powerbroker and mediator in the region on the basis of successful management of the Syrian crisis. Hence Russia’s efforts to reintegrate the Assad regime into the Arab fold. The agreement with Jordan and the US for a ceasefire in southern Syria (July 2017), which excluded Iran and Hezbollah from the area, “helped legitimize Russia’s role as mediator and guarantor in Syria.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russians always remained keen to have other partners in the Middle East, aside from Iran. That became even more of a necessity as the war in Syria wore on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In order to make its military and economic presence in the country an asset and not a burden, Moscow needs a stable government with working institutions which will prevent the country from sliding back into chaos. That is only possible if the government, military/security apparatus go through certain changes, if U.S. sanctions are lifted and economic reconstruction is launched with the involvement of international donors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas Iran’s priority was buying time to entrench itself further in Syria, the Russians wanted to use negotiations about Syria to establish closer relations with a number of Arab states, even through coordination with the Americans. Russian efforts were helped by changes in the strategic views of some of the Arabs. In particular, the UAE was strongly opposed to the Assad government in the early years of the civil war, but around 2015 its position started shifting, and the UAE authorities supported Russia’s intervention, due to the growing role of Türkiye among the opposition groups and the growing role of Islamist groups. Eventually the UAE restored diplomatic relations with Syria in 2018. The UAE saw the relationship with Russia and with Assad as a way to limit or reduce Iran’s influence in Syria. Russia appears to have hoped to get the UAE and other Gulf states to fund part of the reconstruction of Syria, although some observers saw an UAE intent to sabotage the Russia-Türkiye entente as well. More generally, the Russians saw the opportunity for a general improvement of relations with the UAE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Iran’s fear of Arab influence over Assad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Assad’s future above, it was shown how the Iranians opposed Moscow’s idea of sacrificing Assad in the name of regional reconciliation. Iran’s resistance to Russian efforts to edge closer to the Gulf Arabs continued in later years. Eventually, however, Iran’s own approach to the Gulf Arabs evolved amid Chinese mediation, leading to an Iran-Saudi agreement on March 10, 2023. Thus, in April 2023 the Iranians viewed the fact that Saudi ministers were visiting Syria and vice versa as a positive achievement. They also expressed satisfaction that Syria might rejoin the Arab League. The actual decision to readmit Syria into the Arab League on May 7, 2023, came two months after the Iran-Saudi deal. Sources within Iranian diplomacy argued they were in favor of the shift. Officially, Iran congratulated Syria on its readmission. Likely Iran appreciated the legitimizing impact for the Assad regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon, however, the readiness of the UAE to spend billions of dollars in supporting Syria and its armed forces, along with an Arab request that the Iranian presence be scaled down, reawakened fears in Teheran that its influence there would be eroded quickly. The Iranians were perfectly aware that the Saudis, the Kuwaitis, the Emiratis and the Egyptians were all against Syria’s close relationship with Iran and demanded that Damascus curtail it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During 2024, the Iranians were therefore putting renewed pressure on the Syrian government to stay away from the Arab states, especially the Gulf ones. Some Syrian officials were aligned with Iran and rejected countries like Qatar and the Saudis gaining influence, after they had supported radical opposition groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Syrian tilt toward the Gulf proved too strong, however. The UAE played a pivotal role in linking Syria back to the other Arab states. By 2024 and probably earlier, some Syrian officials were describing the UAE as “one of Syria’s allies” and a likely source of financial support in the future, including for the Syrian armed forces. There reportedly were explicit promises in this regard. The Arabs’ worries about the extent of Iranian influence within Syria was shared by many within the Assad regime as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Russia seeks a deal with Türkiye&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran’s and Russia’s attitude toward Türkiye fluctuated over time. The Iranians supported engagement with Ankara from 2012 until 2017, seeking to counterbalance US pressure. In 2017, Russia and Iran swapped positions, and it was the Russians who were insisting on involving the Turks: “Russia is moving on peace talks with Türkiye and opposition groups, but this is not acceptable for us.” By 2019, the two sides had swapped positions again, and now Iran wanted Damascus to improve relations with Türkiye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s relations with Türkiye over Syria were initially tense, not least because of Türkiye’s shooting-down of a Russian Su-24 bomber over the Syrian border on November 24, 2015. As Russia kept working at its diplomatic strategy in Syria, however, it sought to engage Ankara too, perhaps with the intent of building on the thaw in relations following Russia’s help against the plotters of the July 16, 2016, coup. The Astana talks, launched in January 2017, were cosponsored by Russia, Türkiye and Iran, but Russia was clearly the prime mover. Indeed, a common assessment is that the Astana Process proved a success for Russia’s wider goal to gain diplomatic stature through its role in Syria. Russia used the framework of the talks to start a successful long-term effort to co-opt Turkey, away from NATO towards an alignment with Russia and to gain disproportionate influence within international efforts to implement UNSCR 2254. The UN released a statement in late January 2017 praising the Astana Talks as an “important step towards the resumption of intra-Syrian negotiations under the auspices of the United Nations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial Iranian support for the Astana Process abated once it became clear that the talks produced a de facto temporary partition of Syria, with the Idlib pocket and the northern areas becoming a de facto Turkish protectorate. This irritated Assad and his regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Initially, the Syrian government clearly communicated its intentions to the Turkish government, but afterward the Russians interfered and allowed the Turkish government to enter northern Syria.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russians had to calm Assad down, reassuring him that the Turks would withdraw once their clearing operation was completed and warning him that Russia would not support Syria in an open conflict with Türkiye. The Russians might also have seen the Turkish operation as a chance to increase their leverage vis-à-vis the PKK and PYD, which had been refusing to reduce their links with the Americans. The Iranians, by contrast, sided with Assad and lodged a complaint with the Turkish authorities. The Iranians even helped Assad to deploy militias to the area in the early days of the crisis. Despite having cosponsored the Astana talks, Iran soon developed strong reservations. By February 2017, following the steady collapse of IS control in northwestern Syria, Iran and Türkiye were in direct competition for filling the vacuum. Even before Türkiye entered Syria, the Iranians were irritated by Russia’s efforts to negotiate with the Turks and agree a ceasefire in the Idlib area. According to an Iranian diplomat,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The relationship with Türkiye is becoming a matter of disagreement between Russia and Iran, and it is causing problems to take place between Russia and us. […] Now, the ceasefire will just allow Türkiye to support these opposition groups financially and logistically and send them volunteers and stand them back on their feet to fight against Assad’s government. The IRGC did not want a ceasefire, but due to Russia pressure they accepted it. […] Russia is saying that if we have a relationship with Türkiye, peace will come to Syria, but this is a big mistake by Russia; Türkiye is playing a trick here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The source confirmed that there was some suspicion in Iran that Russia and Türkiye might agree to a de facto partition of Syria for the foreseeable future, a plan that Iran would strongly resist, especially if it was left out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russians were clearly very keen on developing a constructive relationship with the Turks, and they seemed confident that this was achievable through thick and thin. Despite what seemed like extreme tension between Russian and Türkiye in February 2020 following the killing of 33 Turkish soldiers in an airstrike, Russian analysts were more worried by the evolution of their relationship with Iran. Finding a settlement of the Syrian crisis in collaboration with the Iranians was seen as deeply problematic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran’s attitude to Türkiye’s role in Syria improved again in 2023. In the immediate aftermath of the start of the Gaza crisis, Erdogan and the Iranian president seemed to be coordinating well, and Erdogan seemed open to revisiting his approach to the Assad regime. When Syria-Türkiye contacts were resumed in 2024 with Russian encouragement, the Iranians officially approved of this, responding to the Turkish media’s portrayal of the talks as an example of Iran-Russia divergence. However, the Iranians felt that Erdogan wanted to exclude them from the talks when he suggested a one-on-one meeting with Assad in Moscow, which was sponsored by Russia as well. Assad raised the issue of Turkish forces on Syrian territory and the meeting never happened. A Russian diplomat was by then treating Türkiye as an ally of Russia on almost a par with Iran, describing Ankara as ready to help maintain stability. The Russians seemed confident that they had the final say in Syria and that the Iranians were isolated, because even the Assad regime wanted to reach an understanding with other regional powers, meaning the Arabs and the Turks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russia-between-israel-and-iran&quot;&gt;Russia between Israel and Iran&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Iran’s strategic deterrence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran aimed “to forge a new layer of deterrence in its asymmetrical regional security structure by using Syria as a forward base to balance against Israel. This is what has come to be known as Iran’s policy of ‘strategic depth’ — that is, to take the fight as close to enemy territory as possible.” Iran’s forward deterrence was described as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;… strengthen[ing] its influence and consolidation in Syria and [deepening] the grip of its proxies in the country by means of profound and multi-faceted penetration of the Syrian systems – defense, economy, education, society, culture, and religion – while gaining control of critical infrastructure, supporting pro-Iranian militias, engaging in Syrian military buildup, and promoting an ideological and demographic transformation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Syrian intelligence source agreed that the IRGC also intended to use its presence in the south, in the event of a war with Israel, as a launchpad for attacks. Indeed, the source confirmed that the IRGC was moving to the south a large number of rockets and missiles, which were no use against the opposition. The Iranians were also busy assembling and gathering rockets and missiles in Syria for transfer to Lebanon. This presence was meant to be permanent. In the words of an IRGC commander:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It is our right to get a permanent base in Syria, as we sacrificed a lot and took part in the long war in Syria, so we deserve to have a permanent base in Syria. The Syrians at the beginning were not happy, and currently they are saying nothing about it, so it seems to be OK.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The diverging attitude of Russia and Iran vis-à-vis Israel is easily observable. While the Russians were keen to maintain good relations with Israel, the Iranians were widely believed to be aiming to turning Syria into a base for operations against Israel to enhance their ability to retaliate against Israel should need be. This divergence led Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov to deny that Russia and Iran were “allies.” Especially from May 2018 onward, the Russians themselves were clearly worried about Iran’s efforts to establish a strong presence near the Israeli border and at the same time started being more tolerant toward Israel’s “containment policy.” Said an analyst in July 2018:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Russian leaders, who once described Iran’s future presence as legitimate, are now asserting the need for the forces of Iran and Hezbollah to leave Syria following the end of the civil war.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Iranians came under “huge pressure” not only from Russia, but from the Assad regime as well, to withhold retaliation against Israel after it started striking their positions in southern Syria. The Iranians kept threatening massive retaliation if the attacks continued; however, they never took action. Syrian intelligence sources argued that what the Israelis were seeking was exactly an Iranian reaction, which would be used to invoke Western intervention, and claimed that the Russians fully agreed with such analysis. For the Assad regime, IRGC help in the south had been sought to achieve Damascus’ priority aim, which was taking control of the southern border in order to prevent infiltration into Syria. Being dragged into a war with Israel was the last thing they wanted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We will never let anybody put our country in a multisided war with regional countries, because it will weaken our country in this critical time, since we already face threats from international terrorism and the hostile actions of regional countries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Russia’s deal with Israel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already in late 2015-early 2016, the Israelis were worried about growing Iran-Russia cooperation. As the Israelis continued airstrikes in Syria, despite the establishment of a Russian air defense network there, they likely intended to remind the Russians of Israeli unwillingness to tolerate the status quo in Syria, which did not factor in Israeli security needs. The Russians sought to adapt to Israel’s posture and eventually seemed to have reached an agreement with Israel, probably in early 2018, committing to prevent the Iranians and allied organizations from getting close to the Israeli border. The Russians even established an ad hoc Syrian army unit (8th Brigade) under their direct control to the south to help keep the Iranians out. The implementation of the agreement was somewhat problematic, but by and large the Assad regime seem to have sided with the Russians on this matter. The Russians allowed the Israelis to carry out attacks on Syrian territory, as long as the Syrian armed forces and government were not targeted. The Iranians made clear that they would not leave Syria just because Russia asked them to do so. Hence the Russians had little choice but to allow the Israelis to take direct action. In Michel Duclos’ words,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The final purpose of this laissez-faire policy from Moscow regarding Israeli strikes in Syria is that Iranian leaders will one day realize themselves what is the “tolerable” level of Iranian presence in Syria from the Israeli point of view. […] The Russian gamble is that the dialectical relationship between Iranian expansion and Israeli strikes will resolve itself in a kind of self-regulation mechanism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Iranians pulled out their own forces from southern Syria, relying instead on a range of local proxies and on Hezbollah. The Russians and Israelis also increasingly converged on the preservation of the Assad regime, with which Israel hoped to reconfirm the de facto pre-civil war agreement on the stability of the border. A stronger central power in Syrian, so runs the argument, is more likely to be in a position to get the Iranians out, or at least to limit their activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Igor Delanoë, the Russians gained points with the Israelis for seemingly having the upper hand in the partnership with Iran in Syria, despite the prevailing belief in the US that Iran’s closeness to Assad gave Teheran the advantage. The Russians benefited from Israeli airstrikes in that they also served the purpose of warning Assad of the risk involved in letting Iran establish itself in Syria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite Iranian efforts to flout the restraints imposed by the Russians, as of early 2021 Lavrov was still saying that Russia will not allow Syria to be used as an “arena of confrontation” between Iran and Israel. At that time, there were even press reports that the Assad regime was negotiating with Israel about a deal to expel the Iranians in exchange for Israel’s acceptance of the status quo in Syria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Russia-Israel deal under stress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Russia invaded Ukraine, some Iranian actors in Syria appeared to be firmly convinced that the Russians would become more sympathetic toward Iran’s plight vis-à-vis Israel, due to Israel assisting Ukraine. In reality, the Russians never had any intention of siding with Israel altogether, but rather tried to maintain a balancing role between the Israelis and the Iranians, a view also shared by some in Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was only after the start of the Gaza crisis, however, that even the Russians started showing concerns that Israel’s actions might destabilize Syria. A Syrian army source reported that Russian advisers were involved alongside IRGC ones in preparations for the contingency of a crisis with Israel. At the same time, Putin had to intervene with Khamenei to make sure that the Iranians’ retaliation after the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran would be “restrained.” As Reuters mentioned on August 6, 2024, citing two senior Iranian sources, Putin advised Khamenei not to attack Israeli civilians through a message delivered on August 5 by Sergey Shoigu, the former defense minister and now secretary of the Russian Security Council, during meetings with senior Iranian officials. Iran was still considering its response to the assassination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, after reducing its commitment to Syria in the wake of the war in Ukraine, Russia increasingly struggled to keep Iran out of the Syrian south entirely. The Iranians still had a presence in 2023. According to a source, as of 2024 there were 49 positions of Iranian and allied forces in the south. Moscow’s determination to pursue close relations with Israel was always at odds with Iran’s determination to use the conflict with Israel to legitimize its quest for hegemony in the Middle East. Maintaining the right balance proved challenging, and Moscow struggled to deliver on its pledges to Israel. The Russians remained committed to keeping the Iranians and their proxies away from at least the Golan. Even delivering this was problematic, as Netanyahu himself alleged. But the Israelis continue to see the Russians as the only possible interlocutor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-russia-and-iran-sought-to-manage-their-divergence&quot;&gt;How Russia and Iran sought to manage their divergence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russias-dilemma-managing-a-marriage-of-convenience-with-iran&quot;&gt;Russia’s dilemma: Managing a marriage of convenience with Iran&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Signaling Russia’s unhappiness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unquestionably Russia and Iran were “mutually dependent on the ground”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Iran cannot conduct an effective ground campaign without the cover of Russian airstrikes; and for Russia to be effective in bolstering Assad’s hold on power, it needs ground troops from Syria and Iran.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original Russian understanding appears to have been that by delivering useful goods to the Iranians through their intervention in Syria, they would gain enough leverage to get the Iranians to agree with their plans. Undoubtedly, initially, “the Russian diplomatic umbrella particularly emboldened the Iranians.” Iran benefited from Russia’s readiness to assist Iran’s military leadership in Syria, introducing Iran and its proxies to “signature Russian campaign-design concepts such as cauldron battles, multiple simultaneous and successive operations, and frontal aviation in Syria.” Later Russia also gained leverage by using its military police as an interposing force on the Turkish border, relieving Iran from the unpleasant task of having to deploy its own forces there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, none of this sufficed. The Russians appear to have felt that the Iranians were not taking Russian demands seriously enough. From 2016 onward, the Russians sought to signal their dissatisfaction to the Iranians. Early signs of Russia-Iran tension included Russia’s failure in 2016 to provide air support for pro-Iran forces in Aleppo, as well as an alleged disagreement over Russian attempts to get the Syrian army to intensify operations in eastern Syria against IS. However, Russia subsequently increased air support for IRGC operations in Aleppo, presumably considering that the message had been delivered. In the end, the battle of Aleppo came to be seen as a success of the collaboration between “Iran, Syria, Russia and Lebanon’s Hezbollah.” During the Aleppo crisis, the Russians were still strongly motivated to stick close to the Iranians, perhaps because they too felt that the Assad regime was too weak for negotiations to work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;During the Aleppo crisis, John Kerry, Obama’s secretary of state, tried to negotiate a settlement which would have involved the moderate opposition. However, Sergei Lavrov, his Russian counterpart, strongly rejected a compromise, siding with Tehran which vehemently rejected any dealing with the opposition.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russians had not given up on asserting their views, however. They involved the Iranians in the Astana Process, as we have seen. This was seen by some see as an indication of an “understanding between the two countries about the future of Syria.” In reality, the Iranians were soon dissatisfied with the main outcome of those talks, namely the de facto Turkish protectorate of Idlib. The Astana Process itself could therefore be seen as yet another Russian attempt to manage the “marriage of convenience” – by pursuing Moscow’s interests while trying to keep the Iranians on board. The partial Russian military withdrawal announced in December 2017 was seen as improving Russia’s leverage vis-à-vis Iran as well, signaling that Russia’s demands had to be taken more seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This signaling continued thereafter. The muted Russian comments over Qasem Soleimani’s killing can be interpreted in the same way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Though Moscow certainly does not rejoice over Soleimani’s death, it is not felt to be a problem in itself. In fact, it is rather to its advantage insofar as the Iranian general was implementing on the ground Tehran’s diehard policy for Syria.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Denying Russia’s most treasured asset: Air defense&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How the Russians managed Iranian and Syrian requests for protection from airstrikes and Israeli requests to hit certain types of targets on the ground in Syria is a good example of Russia’s approach to its dilemma: they were the only ones able to provide air defense, and this gave them leverage, but at the same time Russia would not intervene in Israeli raids in order to safeguard its relationship with Jerusalem and gain additional leverage with the Israelis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the lack of Iranian air defense capabilities in Syria, Iranian and Hezbollah forces there were heavily dependent on Russian and Syrian air defense. Russian and Iranian analysts are cautious on Russia’s alleged complicity with Israel in allowing airstrikes against Iranian and proxy targets in Syria. Nonetheless, there is no question that the Iranians resented the Russian decision of not activating their air defenses in response to Israeli raids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Russians clearly showed they were unwilling to commit to defending Iranian forces from Israeli airstrikes, the Iranians upped pressure for the modernization and rehabilitation of Syrian air defense. The Russians only partially obliged, by starting to overhaul existing Syrian assets, while withholding new technology, despite repeated promises. When Israeli airstrikes extended to Jabal Azzan and Deir ez Zor in spring 2018, Iranian and Hezbollah irritation only grew. The attacks on the T-4 air base saw Iranian targets being hit in close proximity to Russian aircraft. The lack of Russian reactions suggests that the Russians had been warned about the strikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Regarding the Israeli air strike on April 9 on the air base, according to some secret-source information, then Israel had already shared their air strike information with the Russians, and as a result they had already evacuated the airfield, if not, it was not hard for the Russians to shoot down the Israeli missiles, but the problem was that they never wanted to intercept the missiles…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initial Russian reassurances were accepted by the Iranians. An IRGC officer expressed the view that the Russians were serious about helping Syria close the air defense gap and that they would make good on their overhaul of Syria’s air defenses with new equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Russians have clearly stated that they will protect the Syrian forces from possible air strikes, whether by Israel, the US or any other Western powers. […] They have also told us that they have warned Israel to avoid targeting Syrian territory in the future and if it happened again they would respond.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gradually, however, it became clear that the Russians kept colluding with the Israelis in allowing them to target Iranian assets with impunity. Aside from complaining about Russian failures to prevent Israeli airstrikes, the Iranians reacted by deploying their own air defense systems to Syria, such as Bavar, Sayyad and others. The Iranian authorities decided not to deploy their most advanced systems (the Russian-made S-300s) to Syria, preferring to keep them in Iran. As all these Iranian systems were found to be completely ineffective against F-35s and not very effective against any Israeli planes, the Iranians had no alternative but to go back to the Russians and enlist whatever help they could get to improve coverage of the Syrian airspace and to obtain technology transfers that could improve the capabilities of their air defense systems. To this end, Russian and even Chinese specialists deployed to Syria. In practice, however, as the source had to acknowledge, at the time of his interview no Russian technology transfers aimed at improving performance against stealth aircraft had taken place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian approach could only work in the short term, however. Russian reassurances and Iranian hopes in the end proved not to be enough to prevent Russia-Iran relations being damaged by Russia’s persistent “collusion” with Israel and by its refusal to share cutting-edge technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A solution that did not work: Spheres of influence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russians must have realized that managing the “marriage of convenience” by sending signals to the Iranians and playing tricks on them was hardly sustainable. Longer-term solutions were needed. Mona Yacoubian believes that the Russians, in response to the constraints they faced, aimed to create spheres of influence in Syria, with a Russian zone of control in the west, a Turkish one in the north and a US one in the east. The Russians even proposed a federal solution in Syria, which was reflected in its 2016 draft text of a new Syrian constitution. The Russians did not push this agenda hard, aware that neither Assad, nor Iran, nor Türkiye, nor Baghdad approved of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yacoubian believed that Iran was not in a position to establish its own sphere of influence because it did “not exert control over a specific territorial sphere of influence, given the more covert nature of its power in Syria. Instead, Iran and its proxies will project influence in strategic areas under regime/Russian control.” In reality, while the Russians could not raise the issue of an Iranian sphere of influence at the diplomatic level without condemning their plan to rejection, Iranian influence was pervasive in central and even parts of western and southern Syria. Iranian influence was so strong that the Russians were left with the need to carve out their own niches not just in coastal Syria, but also in the south. The arrangements made by the Russians in the south, with the formation of the 5th Corps’ 8th Brigade out of former opposition members and their intent of keeping Assad’s own security forces and the Iranians with their militias out, also looked like another “sphere of influence” being created, around a center of power represented by former southern rebels. In practice, the Russians failed to stop Syrian intelligence and 4th Division from reentering the area and undermining Russia’s deals with former opposition groups. The Iranians were upset by the creation of the 8th Brigade, which they accused of being Salafis and of having links to the Turks and the Arabs. Russia eventually renounced establishing its own sphere of influence on the southern border after it got entangled in Ukraine from 2022 onward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;irans-dilemma-how-to-keep-the-russians-in-without-losing-too-much&quot;&gt;Iran’s dilemma: How to keep the Russians in, without losing too much&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How to keep Assad in power, despite Russia’s plans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even before Russia’s direct intervention, some in Iran were worried about a Russian-Saudi rapprochement, especially the IRGC, and were unhappy about Russia’s preference for saving the Syrian state as opposed to saving Assad. Only Russia’s annexation of Crimea changed the predicament of the Iranians, as Putin sought to add pressure on the Americans and edged closer and closer to intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the immediate aftermath of Russia’s intervention, the Iranians were adamant that they wanted Assad to remain in power, although three Iranian sources admitted that if keeping Assad turned out not to be possible, they could consider seeing him replaced by another Ba’athist, such as senior politicians Hilal Hilal or Mohammad Saeed Bakhtawani. Even a replacement from within the ranks of the Baath was not a consensus opinion, however. An IRGC commander in early 2016 rejected this option, on the grounds that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bashar al-Assad is trustworthy for us, and he always kept a good relationship with Iran, but if another person comes instead of him by the choice of Russia and America, then we do not know how that president will be, whether he will be honest with Iran and the IRGC.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Iran showed strong opposition to the individual who emerged as Russia’s favorite in 2017, Al Sharaa, as president of a transitional government. Allegedly the Iranians did not want a Sunni president and even more so one with good relations with opposition groups and Gulf countries. The Iranians reportedly even threatened an insurrection of their proxies if Al Sharaa replaced Assad. Summing up Iran’s official position, Daniel Brumberg assessed that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Iran’s leaders are united in their conviction that no effort to rebuild Syria will work without Assad (and by implication, his readiness to use force). Thus, Tehran believes that whatever political process emerges, it must include Assad and his allies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in a frank November 2017 interview, an IRGC commander commented that, for Iran, the purpose was not making Syria strong – quite the contrary, Syria under Assad would never recover its former strength, but that would suit Iran’s aim to bring Syria into its sphere of influence:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;… our purpose is that the government of Syria must be weak, and we want to reach our purpose in Syria, like in Lebanon. Syria is at the heart of Iran’s strategy to create a Shiite crescent across the region.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The source insisted that this aim was important enough for Iran that it could possibly lead to serious damage in the relationship with Russia. Iranian resistance was effective so that by April 2018 the Russians had abandoned their push for a transitional government in Syria and seemed resigned to keeping Assad in power. Tensions with Iran eased as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How to keep Russia engaged and concede as little as possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brunberg summed up the Iranian dilemma in Syria as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moreover, given the nearly existential role that the Syrian-Iranian alliance plays in its security policy, Tehran wants to retain as much of a political and military footprint in Syria as the region (and Moscow) will bear.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Syrian conflict was also inevitably affected by geopolitical developments elsewhere, resulting in fluctuations in Iranian perceptions of the Russian commitment to Syria. A commonly held fear among Iranian policymakers and analysts in 2016 was that Moscow’s ultimate goal could be to “change the global geopolitical balance and increase its influence on the international stage,” using Syria “as a bargaining chip to resolve the Ukraine question, at the expense of Iran’s localized interests in Syria.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2015-16, the Iranians at least had no reason to fear a sudden Russian divergence from their immediate war aims. The election of Donald Trump in November 2016 threw even that into question for some months. The Iranians were worried that the Russians might dump the Assad regime in exchange for Trump’s recognition of Russian sovereignty over Crimea, despite Russian denials that this might be in the realm of possibilities. One IRGC colonel indicated that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;According to our intelligence information, if Trump recognizes the annexation of Crimea, maybe Russia will move away from Syria.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By March 2017, at least the Iranians were reassured that the feared blossoming of relations between Putin and Trump did not appear to be taking place, according to an official at their Ministry of Foreign Affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, other factors were pushing Iran and Russia apart over Syria, as discussed in Russia-Iran divergenceabove. By 2018, it was clear that there were strong enough tensions between Russia and Iran to raise Teheran’s suspicions concerning Russia’s long-term goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Russia’s strategy in Syria was part of its push for a “multipolar world,” trying to counterbalance American power by allying with like-minded powers, as Eugene Rumer would put it. However, there were a range of other, less benign possibilities too. Russia eventually abandoning Iran for another partner in Syria was only the most extreme one. If the Americans were not going to be that partner, the Gulf Arabs plausibly could have been. Even concerning the US, it was still conceivable that Russia might use Iran as a bargaining chip for easing American sanctions against Russia. In between these extreme interpretations, various others were plausible. Delanoë believed that Gulf tensions allowed Russia to step into the role of mediator between Iran and the Arab powers. Russia therefore was not planning to dump Iran, but its aspiration to act as a mediator would inevitably reinforce the asymmetry in the partnership. It was also conceivable that Russia would obtain international recognition for Basha al Assad as the legitimate ruler of Syria in exchange for reducing Iran’s footprint in Syria. The Iranians, in any case, could not be sure of what the Russians were really up to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsure about the Russians’ future behavior, the Iranians could not afford to lose them or even to see them seriously reduce their commitment to Syria, meaning they needed to accommodate the Russians to some extent. For example, toward the end of 2018, Russia-Iran tensions over deployments of IRGC and Hezbollah forces in the south were defused as the Iranians agreed to suspend these deployments. Reportedly relations between Iran and Russia improved as a result. In reality, during 2018 the IRGC was developing a covert presence in the south (Rif Dameshq, Quneitra and Daraa regions), with new buildings designed to look like civilian ones but destined to be used as military bases and training centers. The IRGC was therefore playing tricks on the Russians, like the Russians were playing tricks on them. The IRGC was selling this presence to Damascus as necessary in order to control cross-border infiltration by opposition groups. The settlement of Shi’a fighters in these areas was to serve the same purpose. The pace of Iranian entrenchment could be modulated, but ultimately the aim remained the same, boosted by a strong sense of entitlement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We do not care whether Russia is getting stronger or weaker; it is not between Russia and the Islamic Republic of Iran; it is between Syria and Iran, and we did a lot for the people of Syria and for the Syrian government, so we do not care about the Russians; building bases is our goal, and we will build them at any cost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another major risk of Russian disengagement emerged after Russia got entangled in Ukraine in 2022. During 2024, it became increasingly clear that the Iranians had failed to keep the Russian engaged. As the regime’s crisis deepened during 2024 due to a reduced Russian financial commitment (which was mostly Russian retaliation against Assad’s efforts to shrink Russian influence with the Syrian armed forces), a Syrian army officer summed up the Iranian dilemma, arguing that Iran was facing a choice of either taking up the burden or losing influence. Iran, as we now know, was unable or unwilling to take up the burden, with the end result being the collapse of the Assad regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This highlights a dimension that is often lacking in existing analysis of Russia-Iran relations in Syria – the costs of sustaining intervention there (see Russia’s and Iran’s investment in Syria above). Iran needed Russia not just because of its air power but also because of its greater financial resources. The Assad regime was largely living off Iranian and Russian support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The late 2015 alignment of Russia and Iran on Syria was only superficial. The two sides were aware of major divergences between themselves, but they assessed that these needed not hamper cooperation in the short term. Iran and Russia managed to keep cooperating because Iran viewed the Syrian regime as a key strategic asset in their “line of defense,” and at the same time it realized that without Russia the war might be unwinnable. Russia too saw that it stood to benefit from a decisive intervention in Syria. The two sides accepted that the only way they could achieve their minimal aims in Syria was working together, leaving controversial issues for later. The question of the future of the Assad presidency was shelved in 2015, as were Iran’s plans to establish a permanent presence in Syria. The Russians maintained their diplomatic efforts with the Gulf countries throughout the conflict and had no interest in embracing Iran too closely, lest their relations with the Arabs be disrupted. Similarly, the Iranians sought to maintain good relations with Ankara, even when tension between Türkiye and Russia peaked in 2015-16.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These issues were bound to reemerge with force as soon as the battlefield situation eased. In fact, 2017 saw the issue of Assad’s replacement explode again, as the Russians felt that the situation on the ground had improved enough to provide strong leverage in negotiations with the opposition and its foreign sponsors. The Russians were aware that Assad was an obstacle to smooth negotiations, but their real purpose was to mediate a settlement to secure not only their own position in Syria but also their regional influence. At that time, the Iranians were still bent on teaching a lesson to their Gulf Arab rivals and were also worried that Russia might distance itself from Iran if its relations with the UAE and Saudi Arabia improved too fast. As the military strength of the Syria-Iran-Russia alliance grew, the regime started taking over the south. That raised Israeli concerns, adding another rather intractable driver of divergence between Russia and Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arguably, therefore, the problem with the partnership established in 2015 was that it was bound to be undone by its very success. By 2018, the initial consensus was in tatters, and the two uneasy partners had to figure out how to keep pursuing their own aims, while keeping the other on board for the short and medium term. They worked out a “cooperative competition,” in which cooperation was the best course of action as long as they had more to gain from it than by going their separate ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The techniques utilized for enabling cooperation included aggressively signaling unhappiness by withholding protection or participation (the Russian indulged in this), trying to work out spheres of influence, outright cheating (that is, making promises with no intention of fulfilling them) and, more generally, constantly assessing how far to push for one’s own interest without completely alienating the other side, sometimes going as far as engaging in brinkmanship. Given the persistence of distrust between the two partners, assessing exactly how far it was feasible to push was always going to be problematic, and the partnership remained unstable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the new geopolitical environment created by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the Russians were presented with two options, wrote Igor Matveev and Yeghia Tashjian at that time: no longer constraining the expansion of Iranian military influence and a major role for Tehran in Syria’s post-conflict economic reconstruction (as long as Moscow’s strategic interests in maintaining control over the Mediterranean ports of Latakia and Tartus were observed); or trying to coordinate more closely with Türkiye in the north and Israel in the south to contain the Iranian expansion. In fact, the Russians pursued both options at the same time, possibly also because they were aware that Iran was not in a position to expand its commitment dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, throughout nine years of coexistence on the Syrian battleground, Russia and Iran succeeded in continuing to cooperate, yet the quality of their cooperation was certainly suboptimal. Their diplomatic and political divergence considerably disrupted their respective aims and efforts. Russia failed to negotiate a political settlement that would stabilize Syria and entrench Russian influence among the Gulf Arabs, nor did Iran manage to really entrench itself in Syria as it would have liked. By 2019, it seemed that the war was essentially won and that the Assad regime was not under any immediate threat, but the vetoes imposed by Russia and Iran on each other’s policies prevented any political consolidation of the battlefield gains, paving the way for the ultimate collapse of the Assad regime.&lt;/p&gt;

It identifies the U.S., Australia, Saudi Arabia, and Canada as the most competitive jurisdictions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States led global production of rare earth elements (REEs) until the mid-1990s, when China emerged as the dominant supplier. China maintained near-total control of the market until 2012. This monopoly began to face limited competition with the entry of two commercial producers: U.S.-based Molycorp, which later declared bankruptcy, and Australia’s Lynas Rare Earths. Today, REEs are once again in the spotlight as China has leveraged its market dominance by imposing export restrictions that limit U.S. access to these key minerals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The restrictions pose significant risks to U.S. national, economic, and energy security. REEs are essential components in numerous advanced defense systems, including F-35 fighter jets, Virginia- and Columbia-class submarines, Tomahawk missiles, radar systems, Predator drones, and Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) smart bombs. For instance, an F-35 contains more than 900 pounds of REEs, an Arleigh Burke–class DDG-51 destroyer requires approximately 5,200 pounds, and a Virginia-class submarine uses about 9,200 pounds. On the civilian side, REEs are essential for cancer treatment, MRI and PET scanners, automotives (both internal combustion engines and electric vehicles), and consumer electronics such as phones, computers, and other products that contain semiconductors. All these industries are acutely affected by REE shortages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has demonstrated a willingness to weaponize REEs over the last 15 years. In 2010, it banned the export of REEs to Japan over a fishing trawler dispute. More recently, in 2023, it imposed a global ban on the export of technologies for rare earth processing and separation, aiming to obstruct the development of midstream capabilities outside its borders. This move had particularly severe consequences for two key reasons: First, China holds unmatched technical expertise in rare earth processing, especially in solvent extraction—a critical and complex step in REE separation—whereas Western companies have struggled due to limited workforce capabilities, research and development, and environmental regulations. Second, while several REE separation and processing facilities are under construction in other countries, these projects require substantial time to complete and fully operationalize, leaving a prolonged gap in global capacity outside of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s recent imposition of export controls on heavy rare earth elements (HREEs) has underscored the dire reality for the United States, which remains almost entirely dependent on Chinese supply. As of 2023, China accounted for 99 percent of global HREE processing. On the other hand, China has refrained from restricting exports of light rare earth elements (LREEs), which are processed by a more geographically diverse set of countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being the world’s second-largest producer of REEs—thanks primarily to operations at Mountain Pass, California, which account for about 15 percent of global supply—the United States has long depended on China for REE separation. Until early 2024, the United States was shipping most of its domestically mined REEs to China for processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Establishing a resilient REE supply chain—which the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) calls the “mine-to-magnet” supply chain—will require close collaboration with international partners. No single country currently possesses the financial resources or technical capabilities to independently outpace China’s dominance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While China accounts for approximately 60 percent of global REE production, it is responsible for 90 percent of processing, a dominance achieved through deliberate strategies to source REEs globally and consolidate midstream processing domestically, including overpaying for acquisitions. For example, in May 2025, Shenghe Resources, through its subsidiary Ganzhou Chenguang Rare Earths New Material, announced a binding agreement to acquire full ownership of the Australia-based Peak Rare Earths project in Tanzania. The deal, which was announced on May 25, was a $158 million AUD transaction, with a cash offer of approximately $0.359 AUD per Peak share—representing a nearly 200 percent premium over Peak’s May 9 closing price of $0.12 AUD and a 160 percent premium over the 20-day volume-weighted average price of $0.138 AUD. The substantial premium underscores the lengths to which Chinese companies are willing to go to maintain their global dominance in the rare earths supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-hubs-are-a-strategic-approach-to-building-capabilities&quot;&gt;Why Hubs Are a Strategic Approach to Building Capabilities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A mineral processing hub is a centralized location or facility where raw mineral ores are transformed into refined materials suitable for industrial use. These hubs typically manage several key stages of the value chain, transforming raw ore into high-purity metals suitable for manufacturing. Mineral processing hubs leverage economies of scale by streamlining regulatory requirements, including reducing the number of permits and environmental impact assessments necessary for operations. Additionally, they capitalize on the concentration of key resources, including energy, transportation, and water infrastructure; specialized human capital with advanced technical expertise; and greater access to financial capital. This integrated approach enhances operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness across the value chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hubs can also provide prime ground for research and development (R&amp;amp;D), which is essential to supporting the growth of a nascent rare earth processing industry. At the height of the U.S. REE industry, substantial and consistent investment was directed toward the R&amp;amp;D of REE separation technologies. The Ames Laboratory was founded by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission in 1947 following its success in solving a key problem for the Manhattan Project: how to purify uranium metal by separating REE impurities. The groundbreaking uranium work positioned the Ames Laboratory to become the premier REE research facility, pioneering a cost-efficient method for separating REEs in the 1950s. This research paved the way for the development of new defense technologies including radar instruments and lasers for guided weapons, as well as consumer technologies like color televisions and fiber-optic cables for long-distance telephone calls and the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, government investment in the Ames Laboratory and other research groups and laboratories provided the intellectual infrastructure to support technological breakthroughs in the private sector. The Ames Laboratory established a loan program to supply high-purity rare earths for research to scientists in the public and private sectors and created the Rare-Earth Information Center to disseminate key research. However, by the end of the twentieth century, the United States deprioritized REE technology R&amp;amp;D as the industry shifted to China amid the economy-wide trend of transferring manufacturing capacity overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply diversifying sources of mined rare earth ore is not enough to break China’s stranglehold on these critical supply chains. Last year, the U.S.-led Minerals Security Partnership backed Brazil’s Serra Verde rare earths project—the only mine outside Asia currently producing both light and heavy rare earths. Yet despite this strategic investment, the ore is already locked into offtake agreements with China for processing. This is because China’s overwhelming dominance in midstream processing left no viable alternative. Without urgently building global processing capacity, new mining projects will continue feeding directly into China’s control, perpetuating the very dependency the United States is seeking to escape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States must develop a strategy to rebuild REE technical expertise and establish midstream processing hubs beyond China’s control. Given the high cost and complexity of operating processing facilities profitably, consolidating operations into large-scale hubs is essential to achieving economies of scale. To be effective, these hubs should not only advance domestic innovation and industry but also leverage the resources and capabilities of U.S. allies and partners who are best positioned to lead in midstream processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-the-united-states-is-currently-doing&quot;&gt;What the United States Is Currently Doing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government recognizes the urgency of building midstream capacity outside China for REE separation, processing, refining, and manufacturing into permanent magnets for the defense industry. In 2023, the DOD announced its goal of securing a complete mine-to-magnet supply chain by 2027. Achieving this goal will require significant investments in REE processing capacity, a nascent industry in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In efforts to swiftly scale up processing capacity, the DOD deployed significant funds to rare earths projects via the Defense Production Act. Since 2020, the DOD has awarded over $439 million to companies like MP Materials, Lynas USA, and Noveon Magnetics for building LREE and HREE separating and processing and permanent magnet manufacturing capabilities. Most of these midstream investment dollars are headed to Texas; Lynas is building an LREE separation facility in Hondo and an HREE processing facility in Seadrift, MP Materials is constructing its first rare earth metal, alloy, and magnet manufacturing facility in Fort Worth, and Noveon Magnetics is opening its first REE magnet manufacturing facility in San Marcos. With this influx of investments, Texas is on track to become the U.S. hub for rare earth processing and magnet manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2025, MP Materials unveiled a landmark public-private partnership with the DOD aimed at accelerating the development of a vertically integrated rare earth magnet supply chain within the United States. Backed by a multi-billion-dollar package of federal investments and long-term procurement commitments, the initiative will enable MP Materials to scale its annual magnet manufacturing capacity from 1,000 metric tons in 2025 to 10,000 metric tons over the next decade. As part of the agreement, the DOD will acquire $400 million in preferred stock—becoming the company’s largest shareholder—and extend a $150 million loan to support HREE separation expansion. Critically, the U.S. government will establish a price floor of $110 per kilogram for neodymium-praseodymium, offering direct payments to MP Materials when market prices fall below that threshold (which stood below $60 per kg as of June 2025). In addition, the Pentagon has committed to purchasing 100 percent of the permanent magnets produced at the new facility, providing a guaranteed demand signal to anchor long-term production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its strategic significance, the partnership faces two key limitations. First, the Mountain Pass facility primarily contains LREES rather than HREEs. Second, near-term production capacity remains limited: MP Materials is expected to produce only 1,000 metric tons of neodymium-iron-boron magnets by 2025—representing less than 1 percent of the 138,000 metric tons China produced as early as 2018. Achieving full-scale capacity will require a gradual and sustained ramp-up over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Complementing domestic capabilities with allied capabilities will be critical to meeting the DOD’s urgent targets for secure, resilient supply chains—and meeting future demand growth. While the United States accelerates efforts to build domestic capacity, establishing rare earth processing hubs with international partners will unlock critical feedstock, fast-track scalable production, and reduce dangerous dependencies. The most effective partners will combine access to rare earth resources with world-class infrastructure, reliable and affordable energy, a strong commitment to research and innovation, low operating costs, political stability, and regulatory environments that actively encourage industrial investment. Without these global partnerships, the United States risks falling behind in the race to secure the materials vital for defense and advanced technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States is already forging strategic international partnerships to strengthen and diversify its rare earths supply chains. In a landmark move, President Donald Trump prioritized mineral diplomacy during his first state visit with Saudi Arabia, laying the groundwork for a critical minerals partnership between the two nations. Building on this, U.S.-based MP Materials signed a memorandum of understanding with the Saudi Arabian Mining Company (Maaden) to collaborate across the entire rare earths value chain—from mining and processing to the production of permanent magnets—marking a significant step toward building a resilient mine-to-magnet supply chain outside of China’s control. Construction of the mine is expected to begin in 2025—subject to a final investment decision—and production is expected to commence mid-2028. As Maaden CEO Bob Wilt emphasized, “Through a potential partnership with MP Materials, and our deepening ties with the United States, we aim to create a global hub for a fully integrated rare earth value chain supporting advanced manufacturing in the Kingdom.” MP Materials CEO Jim Litinsky called the agreement a critical milestone in “deepening the strategic alliance between the United States and Saudi Arabia.” Saudi Arabia is expected to begin producing heavy rare earths in 2028.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenland has been a prominent focus in President Trump’s foreign policy, primarily because of its rare earth resources. In June 2025, the U.S. Export-Import Bank announced its intent to provide up to $120 million in nondilutive financing for Critical Metals Corp.’s Tanbreez rare earth project in southern Greenland. This would mark the Trump administration’s first international mining investment of this term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;identifying-ideal-partners-for-investment-in-international-midstream-hubs&quot;&gt;Identifying Ideal Partners for Investment in International Midstream Hubs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Establishing and sustaining rare earth processing hubs require massive financial investment, advanced infrastructure, and specialized technical expertise—capabilities few countries possess on their own. Concentrating resources into a select number of strategically located hubs offers the greatest chance of success and long-term resilience. This paper presents a data-driven analysis, evaluating 10 quantifiable criteria across 10 countries to analytically identify the most viable locations for these critical hubs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-government-commitment-to-developing-ree-capabilities&quot;&gt;1. Government Commitment to Developing REE Capabilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the financial capital, technical know-how, permitting, and infrastructure required to create a REE processing hub, government support is a crucial enabler in the form of direct financing, policy reforms to create an enabling environment, support to developing R&amp;amp;D capabilities, and other mechanisms. In addition to the partnership between the DOD and MP Materials and the $439 million the DOD has awarded to companies building domestic REE processing capabilities, the Australian government has given $1.25 billion in financing to build a domestic rare earths refinery. Moreover, Japan has heavily invested in non-Chinese rare earth projects abroad and domestic technical capacity since 2010, and Saudi Arabia has committed to developing a mine-to-magnet REE supply chain with support from the Public Investment Fund, the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund. Without active government support, getting an REE processing hub off the ground can be both difficult and cost prohibitive, given the limited support from capital markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countries that establish commercial partnerships with U.S. companies to develop rare earth processing capabilities are well positioned to secure long-term strategic cooperation and offtake arrangements. Notably, the Australian firm Lynas Rare Earths is constructing an REE separation facility in Texas, backed by U.S. government support. Similarly, U.S-based MP Materials has signed a memorandum of understanding with Maaden to jointly develop REE separation infrastructure in Saudi Arabia, reinforcing bilateral commercial and strategic ties in critical minerals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-proximity-to-feedstock&quot;&gt;3. Proximity to Feedstock&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When evaluating international partners for potential collaboration on REE processing, it is critical to consider the geographic alignment of processing hubs with available resources. Locating specialized hubs for both LREEs and HREEs close to their respective feedstock sources improves operational efficiency, lowers transportation expenses, and reduces supply chain vulnerabilities. Transportation costs represent one of the most significant expenditures in the mining industry. In the case of industrial minerals, for example, transportation can constitute more than 50 percent of the total delivered cost, underscoring the critical importance of proximity to feedstock in determining the commercial viability of a processing hub. This proximity also strengthens the competitiveness of processing operations, which is vital for ensuring their long-term commercial success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countries such as Australia, Brazil, India, Saudi Arabia, and Vietnam possess a distinct geological advantage, supported by substantial REE reserves. At the same time, nations including Canada and Saudi Arabia are actively advancing exploration initiatives to identify and develop new deposits. Diversifying sources of supply across multiple jurisdictions is essential. For instance, the United States’ Mountain Pass mine primarily yields LREEs such as praseodymium and neodymium, whereas critical HREE production, including dysprosium and terbium, remains overwhelmingly concentrated in China and Myanmar. However, Brazil represents a key alternative source for HREEs. As the United States builds its HREE processing capabilities in Texas and California, Brazil is geographically closer to the United States than it is to China. In Saudi Arabia, Jabal Sayid, located 350 kilometers northeast of Jeddah, is estimated to have significant deposits of HREEs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia is emerging as a dominant rare earth producer and processor. The world’s fourth-largest producer of these minerals, it is developing several domestic processing facilities, including Iluka Resources’ Eneabba Rare Earths Refinery in Western Australia, which was backed by a $1.25 billion government loan contingent on offtake agreements with like-minded countries. Iluka will produce separated oxides including neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, and terbium. The refinery is expected to be commissioned in 2026. Arafura Rare Earths Limited’s Nolans Project has received $840 million in federal funding and is expected to produce 4 percent of the world’s neodymium and praseodymium beginning in 2032. Moreover, Australia is set to triple its mined rare earth oxide supply between 2025 and 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2025, Australia’s Lynas achieved a historic milestone, becoming the first company outside China to produce commercial quantities of dysprosium oxide—one of the world’s most critical HREEs—at its Malaysian facility. Production volumes were not disclosed. Lynas sources its feedstock from the Mount Weld mine near Kalgoorlie, Western Australia, which holds an estimated 2 million tons of total rare earth oxides in reserves. Lynas also signed a memorandum of understanding with Malaysia’s Kelantan state government to jointly develop the state’s rare earth deposits as potential future feedstock for Lynas’s processing facility. However, a substantial portion of its output continues to be sent to China for refining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4-infrastructure&quot;&gt;4. Infrastructure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A mineral processing hub requires comprehensive infrastructure, including transportation networks, water supply systems, and waste management facilities. Mineral processing operations require well-developed transportation infrastructure—specifically major railways and ports—to enable the efficient movement of materials. As stated, transportation costs are one of the most significant costs in the mining supply chain. Australia, Canada, and Japan rank highly in terms of developing the infrastructure needed for any large manufacturing project: roads, rail, bridges, ports, and airports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rare earth production also demands substantial water infrastructure. On average, producing one kilogram of rare earths from monazite consumes 11,170 kilograms of water. Water usage varies by element, from 3,803 kilograms of water per kilogram of samarium or gadolinium to as high as 29,902 kilograms of water per kilogram of yttrium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even countries with a strong record of water management must innovate to meet the water needs of REE processing. Canada has access to nearly 20 percent of the world’s fresh water but is still investing in efficient water management systems for rare earth processing. The Saskatchewan government and Saskatchewan Research Council are developing an REE processing facility that will recycle and reuse all water within the plant. Saudi Arabia is combating its water challenges with the construction of desalination facilities to meet demand. In 2023, Saudi Arabia announced a plan for 12 desalination projects and 40 water tanks valued at $1.3 billion to address water needs for industry. Since Indonesia’s mineral export ban, the country has invested $1.7 billion into its water infrastructure to meet the increased water demand from processing facilities. Namibia and South Africa face greater water challenges: Namibian water resources are stretched thin amid severe droughts, and South Africa experiences frequent water interruptions. British mining company Anglo American attributed a 9 percent drop in platinum production at its Rustenburg operations in 2023 to a five-day water stoppage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infrastructure is also essential for handling waste gases, wastewater, and radioactive by-products generated during production. For each ton of rare earths produced, the process generates approximately 13 kilograms of dust, between 9,600 and 12,000 cubic meters of waste gas, 75 cubic meters of wastewater, and one ton of radioactive residue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;5-energy&quot;&gt;5. Energy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mining is among the most energy-intensive industries worldwide. It accounts for approximately 38 percent of global industrial energy use and around 15 percent of total electricity consumption globally. The complexity of separating and processing rare earths makes it especially energy intensive. Separating a single ton of rare earths can require 9–13 times initial extraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating a rare earth processing hub will require significant energy investments. While Australia has substantial energy capacity, its high energy prices remain a barrier to low-cost processing. In contrast, Saudi Arabia is rapidly positioning itself as a global leader in energy affordability and availability, underpinned by record-breaking investments in renewables. Its Al Ghat wind project holds the world record for the lowest electricity cost from wind power at just 1.56558 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh), while the Wa’ad al Shamal project follows closely at 1.70187 cents per kWh. Saudi Arabia also holds the world’s lowest levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for solar photovoltaics, making it unparalleled in affordable renewable power. These strategic investments have positioned the kingdom to emerge as a major player in mineral processing, with ambitions to rank among the world’s top seven mineral processors by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;6-ease-of-doing-business&quot;&gt;6. Ease of Doing Business&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Processing and manufacturing facilities are subject to a number of permits, taxes, and regulations that can increase the complexity and overall cost of operating. Countries with opaque laws, burdensome red tape, and export restrictions make long-term investments in large-scale mineral refining more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the United States, the development of a commercially viable rare earth processing hub faces two regulatory challenges. First, permitting delays continue to hamper project execution. For example, Lynas Rare Earths has halted construction of its planned HREE processing facility in Seadrift due to delays in securing a key wastewater disposal permit. Without this authorization, site development cannot proceed, placing the project’s target of becoming operational by 2026 in jeopardy and risking further delays to production. Second, recent revisions to the Inflation Reduction Act’s Section 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit create uncertainty for long-term investment. In 2024, MP Materials received $12.2 million in benefits through this credit. However, the recently passed federal budget includes a phaseout of the 45X credit by 2033—a timeline that does not align with the multi-year development horizons typical of rare earth processing facilities. This limited incentive window weakens the commercial case for expanding domestic rare earth capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Japan, Canada, Saudi Arabia, and Australia score highly for having regulatory systems that encourage business investments. Australia has taken significant strides to create an enabling tax environment: In early 2025, Australia’s parliament passed a law to give production tax credits worth 10 percent of processing and refining costs for 31 critical minerals, including REEs, with the intent of attracting more minerals processing to Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia has also implemented a new regulatory regime for the mining sector to foster the industry. In 2021, it implemented a new Mining Investment Law, a comprehensive set of reforms designed to support the country’s critical minerals ambitions laid out in its Vision 2030 and, specifically, to attract foreign private investment. The legislation includes a streamlined licensing process whereby exploration licenses are issued for up to 15 years and mining licenses for 60 years. Under the law, Saudi Arabia has seen a 138 percent increase in exploration licenses since 2021. The Mining Investment Law is further supported by new incentive programs. For example, the Global Supply Chain Resiliency Initiative offers $2.7 billion in incentives to strengthen critical domestic mineral supply chains. The initiative has already led to over $9 billion in investment deals, including a partnership with Australia’s Hastings Technology Metals to establish a fully integrated rare earth downstream processing supply chain in Saudi Arabia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Brazil’s minerals licensing processes are a major impediment to the development of its minerals sector. The regulatory landscape is complex, as companies are required to navigate federal, state, and local regulations that are sometimes inconsistent. Due to burdensome red tape, obtaining a mining license in Brazil takes an average of 16 years. The CEO of the Brazilian Mining Association has noted that other countries take half to one-third the time Brazil does to approve licenses and believes that minerals investments in Brazil could be even greater if the processes were streamlined. In January 2025, Brazil announced $815 million in financing for projects aimed at boosting development of critical minerals and rare earths in the country, but rare earth company Meteoric Resources is still struggling to finance its Caldeira project in Brazil. Unless bureaucratic challenges are addressed, these financing incentives will not catalyze the amount of private investment needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;7-exploration-investment&quot;&gt;7. Exploration Investment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rare earth deposits are being actively mapped and discovered worldwide, fueled by growing investment from mining companies focused on geologically promising regions. Exploration spending plays a vital role—not only in identifying commercially viable deposits, but also in sending important signals to midstream processors about which jurisdictions are advancing as future sources of reliable feedstock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia currently leads the world in REE exploration, accounting for 42.9 percent of global exploration spending aimed at identifying new mining opportunities. This sustained investment has played a key role in recent discoveries of dysprosium, a heavy rare earth vital to reducing global dependence on China’s supply chains. Outside Australia, countries like Brazil, South Africa, and Saudi Arabia are also seeing increased interest in REE exploration. Across Africa, rare earth exploration is gaining momentum, with South Africa, Malawi, Uganda, and Namibia ranking among the top 10 destinations for exploration investment in 2024. This trend signals a strategic shift as these nations actively prepare for future production and seek to strengthen their role in global critical mineral supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1. Rare Earth Exploration by Country, 2024&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;8-operation-costs&quot;&gt;8. Operation Costs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Labor, water, energy, processing materials, and technology costs make rare earth processing a high-cost endeavor with slim profit margins. This price environment creates additional challenges for REE processors struggling amid such tight margins, and low operation costs are a significant determinant of whether a hub can be competitive. Chinese rare earth processing operations remain the most cost-efficient in the world due to lower labor costs, fewer environmental and regulatory hurdles, and the achievement of large-scale operations that absorb large volumes of feedstock and sustain profitability. While little data exists on the exact costs of rare earth processing due to limited facilities outside of China, operating costs for other commodities offer a benchmark to estimate comparative costs for REE operations, given they require similar inputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world’s lowest-cost rare earth producers can make a kilogram of rare earth oxide for $11 or less. These are mostly hard rock mines, which tend to have higher concentrations of LREEs. Many of these mines are already in operation, including China’s Baiyun Ebo and the Sichuan hard rock projects, which are among the largest global suppliers. The U.S.-based Mountain Pass mine and Australia’s Mount Weld also operate at competitive costs, though they produce smaller volumes. A cost-competitive mineral processing hub depends on more than just securing competitively priced raw material feedstock; it also requires reliable access to low-cost energy, efficient transportation infrastructure, advanced processing technologies, and affordable, skilled labor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;9-research-and-development&quot;&gt;9. Research and Development&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prioritizing R&amp;amp;D is essential for advancing innovative technologies that improve the efficiency of rare earth separation and refining processes. Continued investment in R&amp;amp;D enables the development of new methods that consume less water and energy, reduce environmental impacts, and maximize the recovery of high-quality materials from lower volumes of raw feedstock. As global demand for rare earths intensifies—particularly for use in advanced technologies such as electric vehicles, renewable energy systems, and defense applications—enhancing processing efficiency and reducing associated costs will be critical to ensuring long-term supply security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countries that make significant R&amp;amp;D investments are better positioned to lead in the development of next-generation rare earth processing technologies. These nations are more likely to allocate resources to specialized REE initiatives, including advanced material science research, the deployment of cutting-edge separation technologies, and the exploration of alternative, environmentally sustainable refining techniques. Japan and Australia lead the way in total R&amp;amp;D investment as a percentage of GDP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few countries lead the way in developing critical minerals and REE-specific R&amp;amp;D initiatives to support the development of the strategic sector. The Australian Critical Minerals R&amp;amp;D Hub is working to boost international cooperation on critical minerals R&amp;amp;D. The hub includes rare earth and downstream processing initiatives led by government agencies working in partnership with industry and universities to boost technical capacity. Japan has the Center for Rare Earths Research within its Muroran Institute of Technology, as well as a joint initiative with Vietnam to improve REE extraction and processing at the Rare Earth Research and Technology Transfer Centre in Hanoi. The initiative was launched in 2012 as Japan looked to strengthen and diversify its REE supply chains in response to a 2010 Chinese REE export ban. In July 2025, Japan announced that it would begin “test mining” for REEs extracted through deep-sea mining near Minamitori Island, 1,900 kilometers off the coast of Tokyo, as early as January 2026. These initiatives are critical to unlocking the next generation of processing technology and finding innovative ways to boost profitability and compete against Chinese adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;10-political-stability&quot;&gt;10. Political Stability&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, political stability is crucial to the success of any long-term business venture but especially in the mining and minerals industry, which is prone to social unrest, asset seizure, and export bans. Rare earth processing hubs are most effectively established in countries with a low risk of political violence or instability that could disrupt operations. Stable, predictable policy environments also provide investors with greater assurance that regulatory frameworks will remain consistent, reducing the risk of unexpected policy shifts that could negatively affect business operations. In the 2023 Fraser Annual Survey of the mining industry, 54 percent of Canadian respondents and 52 percent of Australian respondents indicated that political stability was a key factor encouraging investment in their countries. In contrast, only 5 percent of respondents expressed the same confidence regarding South Africa, highlighting the challenges of attracting investment in regions with political instability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;identifying-priority-jurisdictions-for-rare-earth-processing-hubs&quot;&gt;Identifying Priority Jurisdictions for Rare Earth Processing Hubs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper applies the 10 previously outlined criteria to systematically assess and quantify the performance of 10 selected countries in each area. The objective is to provide a data-driven evaluation of which countries are best positioned to develop into cost-competitive hubs for rare earth processing. Each country was assigned a score from 1 to 3 across all ten categories, with the specific quantitative thresholds used to determine these scores detailed in Appendix 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By analyzing these countries across a standardized framework, the authors aim to highlight comparative advantages and identify critical gaps that may facilitate or hinder their ability to attract investment, establish competitive processing infrastructure, and integrate into global REE supply chains. This approach not only supports strategic decisionmaking for policymakers and investors but also offers practical insights into where future development efforts and policy initiatives should be concentrated to strengthen global rare earth processing capabilities. Ultimately, this analysis provides a comprehensive, evidence-based ranking of countries based on their potential to emerge as leading centers for rare earth processing, taking into account both current capabilities and future opportunities for growth and competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States emerges as the front runner as a global rare earth processing hub, scoring 2.7 out of 3.0. Several factors position the U.S. as an ideal location for rare earth processing: In addition to adequate infrastructure, ample feedstock, and significant R&amp;amp;D investment, recent policy developments position the U.S. to become a leader in REE processing. First and foremost, the U.S. government has made a firm commitment to develop REE processing and magnet manufacturing capabilities in the form of the DOD’s $400 million equity investment in MP Materials with price support and guaranteed offtake of its permanent magnets. LREE and HREE processing facilities under construction in Texas and California will be well-suited to process rare earth feedstock from around the world for secure magnet supply chains independent of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia (2.6/3.0), Saudi Arabia (2.6/3.0), and Canada (2.5/3.0) are also top performers in the index. Australia and Saudi Arabia are strengthening commercial ties to the United States to co-develop rare earth magnet supply chains through firms such as Lynas Rare Earths and Maaden. These three countries also possess strong infrastructure, regulatory environments, and exploration budgets that are creating enabling environments for rare earth supply chain development. These countries will be key partners for the U.S. to build rare earth supply chains outside of China capable of meeting both defense and commercial industry needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A detailed breakdown of how each country performed across the 10 indicators can be found in Appendixes A and B.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Securing resilient and cost-competitive rare earth supply chains is one of today’s most pressing strategic imperatives. As global demand for REEs accelerates—driven by their critical role in defense systems, advanced technologies, and the clean energy transition—the United States and its allies must take decisive action to reduce their dependence on China’s dominant midstream processing capabilities. Without significant investment in both domestic and international processing hubs, as well as renewed focus on R&amp;amp;D, the West will remain vulnerable to supply disruptions and economic coercion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This analysis demonstrates that no single country possesses all the necessary factors to independently establish a fully competitive and resilient rare earth supply chain. A successful strategy must therefore combine domestic efforts with targeted international partnerships. Countries such as Australia, Canada, and Saudi Arabia offer strong foundations for processing hubs thanks to their financing commitments to develop REE processing capabilities, stable political environments, advanced infrastructure, and robust R&amp;amp;D ecosystems. While not all of these countries are currently producing large quantities of rare earths, they have the characteristics that provide promising opportunities to develop new hubs, supported by favorable investment climates, abundant energy resources, and increasing REE exploration activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Establishing midstream hubs in strategic locations will provide essential economies of scale, reduce transportation and processing costs, and facilitate greater collaboration between mining operations and advanced manufacturing sectors. Equally important is the need to revitalize R&amp;amp;D initiatives to drive technological innovation in processing methods, improve resource efficiency, and reduce environmental impacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To meet urgent national security and economic objectives, the United States must pursue a dual-track approach: (1) rapidly building domestic REE processing and magnet manufacturing capacity while (2) working with trusted allies to establish global processing hubs. This integrated strategy will strengthen supply chain resilience, promote innovation, and ensure that the materials critical to modern economies and defense capabilities remain secure and accessible. Without swift and coordinated action, the window to counter China’s entrenched dominance will continue to narrow, placing critical technologies, industries, and security interests at ongoing risk.&lt;/p&gt;

To effectively build that resilience, we must first define and understand the current state of resilience among gamers, then identify the factors that contribute to it. This article seeks to do that by building upon the mostly offline-focused Building Resilience Against Violent Extremism framework to explore its applicability in the digital environment and specifically within the highly gendered parameters of gaming spaces and experiences. This article builds upon the wider data collection and findings of a project exploring socialization in gaming spaces with a nexus to radicalization through a gender lens.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rise of online gaming as a dominant social and entertainment space has increasingly attracted attention as a potential vector for radicalization to violent extremism (VE). Gaming platforms, with their global reach and immersive experiences, are prime environments for fostering identity formation and community building—factors that can be exploited by extremist actors (Schlegel and Kowert, 2024; Lamphere-Englund and White, 2023). An essential part of countering and preventing the spread of VE in gaming and other online spaces is limiting the availability of extremist content and curbing the influence of extremist actors. Yet, given the challenges of completely eradicating harmful content from these vast community spaces, we also need to focus on strengthening the resilience of individuals active in online spaces against VE. To effectively build that resilience, we must first define and understand the current state of resilience among gamers, then identify the factors that contribute to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article builds on data collected from the research project “Examining Socialization with a Nexus to Radicalization Across Gaming (−Adjacent) Platforms Through a Gender Lens,” which was funded by Public Safety Canada, led by the Royal United Services Institute and implemented by a consortium of members of the Extremism and Gaming Research Network (EGRN). The article aims to bridge a gap in understanding the socialization processes in gaming spaces that contribute toward radicalization leading to VE. Specifically, we develop and test a modified version of the offline-centered Building Resilience Against Violent Extremism (BRAVE) framework (Grossman et al., 2017), revised for digital and gaming environments – calling it Building Resilience Against Violent Extremism Digitally (BRAVED). In doing so, we present a resilience model tailored specifically to the gaming space. Using data collected through an international survey of 2,244 gamers in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Indonesia, the US, and the UK, this study presents a factor structure of digital resilience against VE, based on the core components of the BRAVE model. This framework allows for the categorization of survey participants into “Low,” “Mid,” and “High” resilience groups, providing insights into how various factors contribute to differing levels of resilience. The analysis across different demographic groups offers key insights into how resilience varies by country, age group, and gender, revealing valuable insights for targeted intervention activities to build resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In doing so, this article contributes to the theoretical grounding of digital resilience frameworks. It provides practical insights for policymakers, game developers, and practitioners working to prevent and counter VE within gaming and gaming-adjacent platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;resilience-against-violent-extremism-in-digital-spaces&quot;&gt;Resilience against violent extremism in digital spaces&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resilience intersects with broad fields of study, as the concept originated in environmental ecosystem theory and expanded to fields as divergent as public health and terrorism studies. For this article, we define resilience as the ability of a group or individual to withstand exogenous shocks, particularly violent extremist ideologies and recruitment attempts, without employing violence (Grossman et al., 2017; Ungar, 2021). We also place the conceptualization of resilience at an individual level in negotiation with social ecosystems such as broader ethnic, religious, and gendered practices and norms, particularly social capital bonds such as those built through gaming communities (Bronfenbrenner and Morris, 2006).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In doing so, we align this study with the broader literature around resilience and “protective factors” (Rottweiler, 2022) against VE, which typically draw on institutional, social, and political processes across many systemic layers (Sieckelinck and Gielen, 2018). Meanwhile, in keeping with Berger (2018), we define extremism as the “belief that an in-group’s success or survival can never be separated from the need for hostile action against an out-group,” and VE as that which promotes ideological, political, or religious aims; advocates for or actively uses violence to realize those aims; and, tolerates, supports, or directly uses violence against civilians or critical civilian infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study draws on the BRAVE framework and survey tool (Grossman et al., 2022, 2017). In keeping with the definition of resilience above, BRAVE looks at not merely the absence of risk factors or specific correlations to support for violent extremism, but looks at a composite and positive set of protective factors that empower individuals and communities (Lamphere-Englund et al., 2022). BRAVE is designed to be localized and adapted to each cultural context in which it is deployed and has been used in over 15 countries to date, including studies in Indonesia and Kyrgyzstan (for example, Jailobaeva, 2020; Lamphere-Englund et al., 2022). This is, to our knowledge, the first attempt at adapting BRAVE to a specific set of digital communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The framework is built on interrelated factors that act as protective factors against VE: cultural identity and connectedness, bridging capital, linking capital, and violence-related beliefs and behaviors. These factors collectively capture a range of identity complexities and social capital measures (Putnam, 2000, 2001) that underpin an individual’s ability to resist extremist narratives. BRAVE measures protective positive attributes conceptualized to guard against VE. However, less of these protective factors at an individual level should not be viewed tautologically as presenting a higher likelihood of committing targeted violence or terrorist acts. It is not a behavioral threat assessment tool at a granular level; but rather a macro-level view of what can strengthen communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this foundation, we provide a novel, experimental adaptation of BRAVE by adapting it for digital and gaming environments: BRAVED. The next sections describe, in brief, the theoretical underpinnings of core factors of the model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;theoretical-framework-components&quot;&gt;Theoretical framework components&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cultural-identity-and-connectedness&quot;&gt;Cultural identity and connectedness&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cultural identity and connectedness in BRAVE encompass how individuals maintain and engage with their cultural background(s), including their sense of belonging to cultural groups and confidence in navigating diverse cultural environments (Grossman et al., 2017). This factor is critical in forming a positive sense of self, which can act as a buffer against extremist narratives that often exploit feelings of identity-based grievance or exclusion (Phelan, 2023). Within digital spaces, especially gaming environments, cultural identity plays a pivotal role in determining how individuals interact with others and perceive the inclusivity of online communities (Wallner et al., 2023). The project highlighted the importance of considering the gendered and intersectional nature of identity and how socio-culturally developed identity factors impact gamers’ individual and community identity formations and behaviors (White et al., 2024).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this study, we adapted BRAVE’s focus on cultural identity to digital contexts by asking respondents how identities such as religion, ethnicity, gender expression, and sexual orientation play into online interactions and how strongly they feel grounded in those identities. We also ask how strongly individuals identify with being a gamer and how that identity interplays with the more traditional aspects above. Considering these dimensions, our approach acknowledges the multiple and intersecting identities that shape players’ experiences in a gaming environment. Respectively, examining the role of religion in shaping behavior and experiences within these spaces offers insight into how religious identity – along with knowledge, which we did not determine in this study – can influence resistance to extremist narratives (Fair et al., 2017; Fair and Patel, 2022). Ethnicity was included as a critical part of identity formation, as well as a group-identity-building characteristic used both for beneficent and malicious ends: for example, support for white supremacy in gaming communities (Kowert et al., 2022). Prior research shows that women and marginalized gender and sexual identities often face heightened harassment online, affecting their sense of belonging and resilience pathways (Fox and Tang, 2017). Lastly, we included a new variable to the identity matrix: that of being a gamer. A distinct “gamer” identity is a powerful marker within digital spaces. Prior research – including by members of our research team – has shown how individuals express and fuse complex layers of their personhood into a singular gamer identity, which in turn appears to reduce resilience against extremism (Gómez and Vázquez, 2015; Kowert et al., 2022).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also sought to improve the standard BRAVE framework by grafting the survey into a broader Gender-based Analysis Plus (GBA+) framework, which we used to examine all elements of data collection and analysis in the other forthcoming project outputs (White et al., 2024; Schlegel and Kowert, 2024; Wallner et al., 2023). The framework was used at every stage of the project to ensure that analysis of gender identity and the full spectrum of intersecting identity factors— including race, class, age, ability, sexuality and geography—were not treated as an after-thought but as core analytical lenses. GBA+’s “Plus” reminds us that radicalization pathways are shaped by overlapping systems of privilege and marginalization, not by gender alone (Government of Canada’s Approach on Gender-Based Analysis Plus, Government of Canada, Women and Gender Equality Canada (WAGE), 2024). Guided by this principle, we treated violent misogyny, homophobia, and other forms of targeted hate as mutually reinforcing risks that can weaken individual and community resilience. Survey items therefore both captured respondents’ experiences of inclusion and harassment, while also exploring how in-group bonding and out-group “othering” differ across platforms and player demographics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applying the framework meant designing a deliberately global, cross-cultural sample within budgetary limitations. We chose to look at Canada, the US, the UK, France, Germany, Australia and Indonesia to surface how the same game mechanics and social features can have divergent equity impacts in distinct regulatory and cultural contexts. Phase One of the broader project generated the evidence base; Phase Two translated those insights into this article, along with a practitioner toolkit and policy briefs. Throughout, we asked not only who is most exposed to extremist narratives in gaming, but also why intersectional identity profiles may face distinct challenges and benefit from tailored safeguards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;bridging-capital&quot;&gt;Bridging capital&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bridging capital represents the social interactions and relationships across different groups of people. It reflects the inclusiveness and openness of an individual’s social network (Putnam, 2000). The ability to actively engage with diverse others can foster tolerance and empathy, which are, in turn, essential components of resilience against extremist narratives that seek to polarize communities (Miller-Idriss, 2020). In gaming contexts, we translated the concept of bridging capital into the comfort levels and preferences gamers have when interacting with others from various identities. We note that the ability to form loose and close ties within diverse gaming communities has been found to contributes significantly to building resilience (Kowert et al., 2022).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;linking-capital&quot;&gt;Linking capital&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linking capital refers to how individuals relate to institutions and authorities, such as their trust in law enforcement or government agencies (Grossman et al., 2022). This factor indicates individuals’ comfort and confidence when engaging with power structures. While not directly measured in our adaptation to digital spaces, linking capital remains relevant, as the gaming community often interacts with platform moderators, law enforcement, and policy frameworks that govern online behavior (Lamphere-Englund and Hartgers, 2024). Understanding this interaction is vital to addressing toxic behavior and harassment within online gaming spaces (Klein and Nocera, 2024; Anti-Defamation League, 2024). In our survey, we looked at reporting knowledge and feelings of being heard when reporting in gaming spaces, but after review decided these did not directly map onto linking capital and chose to report on those in separate reports (forthcoming in 2025).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;confronting-hate&quot;&gt;Confronting hate&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Confronting hate, or the willingness to stand up for others being harassed or harmed, is a proxy for and corollary to bridging capital and, to an extent, linking capital. We assess this as a separate factor in the analysis, though the theoretical underpinnings are closely associated with social capital theory. For our online adaptation, we asked about players’ willingness and actions to stand up against harassment and extremist content in gaming spaces. The presence of such behaviors signals a level of social cohesion and collective resilience that can counter divisive extremist narratives (Anti-Defamation League, 2024). Research has indicated that when individuals actively confront hate online, it can create a more inclusive and resilient community (Jakubowicz et al., 2017; Wachs et al., 2024; Wallner et al., 2023).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;violence-related-beliefs-and-behaviors&quot;&gt;Violence-related beliefs and behaviors&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BRAVE also examines attitudes toward violence, capturing beliefs that justify violence and behaviors that challenge violent actions (Grossman et al., 2022). This factor reveals the cognitive and behavioral dimensions of resilience by assessing how individuals confront or resist narratives promoting VE. In gaming spaces, these attitudes often manifest as reactions to toxicity, harassment, and extremist content, where players may either condone or confront such behaviors (Schlegel and Kowert, 2024). We looked at two proxies for these attitudes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intolerance and Intolerant Beliefs: In gaming environments, we used this as a proxy for “violence-related beliefs” in the original BRAVE tool. This category captures respondents’ attitudes toward toxicity and extremist content in gaming spaces. By exploring these dynamics, we aim to understand how normalizing toxic behaviors can affect gamers’ perceptions and susceptibility to extremist narratives (Schlegel and Kowert, 2024). The online gaming ecosystem has been found to both propagate and challenge these intolerant beliefs, depending on the nature of player interactions (Lamphere-Englund and White, 2023).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hate and Harassment-Related Behaviors: We use these as an online proxy for violence-related behaviors asked for in BRAVE. Digital gaming environments are known to host a spectrum of abusive behaviors, including identity-based harassment (Fox and Tang, 2017). Understanding to what extent respondents engage in these behaviors within the context of gaming spaces allows us to draw then correlations based on a willingness to engage in identity-based harassment that might shape individuals’ resilience to extremist ideologies. This focus aligns with research showing that exposure to and participation in toxic online behaviors can impact one’s likelihood of adopting extremist views (Phelan, 2023).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;materials-and-methods-developing-and-testing-braved&quot;&gt;Materials and methods: developing and testing BRAVED&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;data-collection&quot;&gt;Data collection&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Survey design&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To assess exposure, vulnerabilities, and resilience to VE in gaming and gaming-adjacent platforms, we designed a comprehensive survey instrument deployed across seven case study countries: Australia (AU), Canada (CA), Germany (DE), France (FR), United Kingdom (GB), Indonesia (ID), and the United States (US). The survey’s primary goal was to address the research questions outlined in the introduction, particularly evaluating how gamers’ resilience to VE is influenced by factors such as exposure to extremist content, gender, cultural differences, and gaming behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 20-question survey included questions we used to develop our compound BRAVED measure. Additional questions were added on exposure to violent extremist content, normalization of toxicity and extremism in gaming spaces, games played, adjacent platform use, and experiences with harassment but were not used in this analysis [those findings can be found in White et al. (2024)]. We also explored the role of gender and cultural variances across geographies in shaping the socialization process within transnational gaming spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By drawing on the principles of the BRAVE framework, as outlined above, we created the BRAVED compound measure of resilience. The exact questions and factors used are elaborated below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survey design involved multiple stages of validation. The survey instrument was developed in consultation with the research team and EGRN partners, with extensive internal reviews to ensure relevance across different contexts. After the initial design, the survey was translated into the languages of the case study countries and underwent a thorough review for accuracy in terminology. A pre-launch phase involved testing with partner organizations to refine the appropriateness of language, length, and sensitivity of topics. The research adhered to robust ethical standards and institutional ethics approvals governing sensitive data collection and reporting throughout the implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Survey implementation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survey was conducted through mobile online polling via Pollfish, a private polling provider. Pollfish uses a random sampling of pre-screened mobile phone users in a more extensive survey panel maintained by the company. Respondents were invited through a double opt-in process to maintain rigor in respondent eligibility. Each country was assigned a soft quota targeting n = 300 respondents (split evenly by gender, with an age distribution of 18–28 and 29–44). The survey ran from August 4-28, 2023, yielding a total sample size of n = 2,244 across all seven countries (Table 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/gPImfTX.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1. Survey sample.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;informed-consent-and-ethics&quot;&gt;Informed consent and ethics&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research plan, survey instrument, and data-handling rules received full approval from two Institutional Review Boards involved in the full study of which this article is one output. As noted, the project was funded by Public Safety Canada, led by the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) and implemented by a consortium of members of the Extremism and Gaming Research Network. All fieldwork was cleared by the Royal United Services Institute Ethics Committee and the University of Southampton’s ERGO panel (ERGO/92202). All work complied with relevant counterterrorism regulation and were found to fully address ethical issues. The survey ran through a commercial service provider – Pollfish – and it’s random-device-engagement network, which sends ads to adults inside thousands of mobile apps and invites them—once only—to participate. Before answering a single question, each prospective respondent sees a standalone informed consent screen that (i) explains the study’s purpose and expected length, (ii) stresses that participation is voluntary and can be terminated at any time, (iii) outlines how responses are anonymized, and (iv) offers a small in-app incentive. Continuing requires an explicit “I agree” tap; otherwise the invitation closes with no data captured. Pollfish blocks bots and duplicates, disqualifies anyone who reports being under 18 or who fails age-screeners, and operates under GDPR, CCPA and ESOMAR/MRS rules, while sharing no personally-identifiable information with researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Downloaded survey data contained no names, emails, IP addresses or advertising IDs. They were encrypted immediately and stored on password-protected institutional servers; working files resided only on VPN-protected, dedicated laptops. All public-facing analyses aggregate the data and redact free-text that could re-identify individuals. Researcher welfare was also ensured by ethics protocols: exposure to violent or hateful responses was time-limited, tasks were rotated, and staff had access to mental-health support. These combined safeguards ensure the project met international standards for informed consent, privacy, data security and duty of care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;limitations&quot;&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the generalizability of our survey sample is limited due to our reliance on an opt-in, mobile-based survey of 2,244 gamers recruited through Pollfish across seven countries and two age brackets (18–28; 29–44). Although quotas were set for gender and age, the sample is not probability-based: respondents self-select into the panel and may differ systematically from gamers who do not engage with in-app polling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, as all measures were self-reported, social desirability bias due to the sensitive nature of asking after hate and harassment behaviors be at play. In the full study (White et al., 2024), we collected and analyzed primary data from online sources to mitigate that effect, but this article only relies on the survey data for analysis. Even with anonymity, recall errors, social-desirability bias and differential willingness to disclose controversial behaviors (e.g., harassment) means that respondents may down-play their own misconduct. In short, this means the survey may understates the true prevalence of hate and harassment reported elsewhere in gaming research. Future studies should test indirect questioning, endorsement experiments, or list-experiment techniques to gage these behaviors more accurately. We chose to focus on the BRAVED measure and not draw on external behavioral data for this limited article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the survey offers only a snapshot in time captured between 4 and 28 August 2023. Gaming cultures, platform policies, and extremist tactics evolve rapidly. Resilience levels and exposure patterns may have shifted since data collection. Longitudinal or repeated-cross-section designs would be required to track trends over time and to assess causality in the exploratory relationships identified here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, while the use of a mobile polling method ensured geographic reach, it provides no visibility into private or encrypted game chats where socialization linked to extremism and mobilization often occurs. Our findings here relate to gamers’ perceptions and self-reported experiences rather than to the full ecology of in-game interactions or platform-level moderation data. For exploration of those wider dynamics, please see the longer analysis from this study (White et al., 2024).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the findings below, and especially those drawn between countries should be viewed as exploratory in nature. The study was powered primarily to validate the BRAVED factor structure; the per-country cell sizes (n = ~300) limit statistical power for fine-grained subgroup tests, and we did not control for all contextual variables (such as national gaming-market composition, regulatory environments, and so on). Consequently, observed cross-national differences in resilience or factor loadings like the higher “High-resilience” share in the United States versus France and Germany should be interpreted as indicative patterns that warrant deeper, country-specific investigation rather than definitive rankings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;exploratory-factor-analysis-efa-and-reliability-test-results&quot;&gt;Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and reliability test results&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We conducted an Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) following data quality checks. The primary purpose of this analysis was to identify latent factors that could explain the patterns of responses across the multiple survey items related to exposure to hate, harassment, extremist content, and other variables associated with gamer identity and socialization. This approach allowed us to substantiate our theoretically grounded framework for resilience, which was used to develop a compound resilience indicator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before running the analysis, we verified the suitability of the data for factor analysis by examining measures of sampling adequacy. Using a Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) test yielded values above 0.80 for most of our model variables, indicating an appropriate level of sampling adequacy. Bartlett’s test of sphericity was significant (p &amp;lt; 0.001), confirming that the data was suitable for factor analysis. Principal axis factoring (PAF) was used to extract factors. Eigenvalues and scree plots were employed to determine the number of factors to retain from our 20 questions (and sub-questions). Based on the results, we grouped our results into seven factors. We applied an oblique rotation (Promax) to improve interpretability. Given that the factors are likely correlated (e.g., exposure to hate and harassment behaviors likely correlates with other forms of intolerance), the oblique rotation was deemed more appropriate than orthogonal methods. Each survey item was loaded onto its respective factor, with a threshold set at 0.40 for inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EFA results confirmed the presence of distinct, interpretable factors that aligned with our theoretical framework – a seven-factor model that explained most of the variability in our data. However, some items did not load as expected and required further refinement or exclusion from subsequent confirmatory analyses. For example, items related to bullying behaviors (Factor 2) loaded strongly together, while items concerning tolerance toward others in gaming spaces (Factor 3) showed a similar internal consistency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure the internal consistency of the identified factors, we conducted Cronbach’s alpha reliability tests for each of the seven factors. Cronbach’s alpha measures internal consistency, indicating how closely related a set of items is as a group. Factors with a Cronbach’s Alpha above 0.70 were deemed acceptable, though we considered factors below this threshold for inclusion based on theoretical importance. The final factors were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Factor 1: Hate and Harassment-Related Beliefs, which included items related to toxicity, extremism, and difficulties in trusting others from diverse backgrounds online.&lt;/strong&gt; The items measuring attitudes toward toxicity and extremism showed high internal consistency: Cronbach’s alpha was 0.647. Questions included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Q17_1: “I think toxicity in the gaming space is…[Unacceptable, Normalized, Culturally Acceptable, Justified]”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Q17_2: “I think extremism in the gaming space is…[Unacceptable, Normalized, Culturally Acceptable, Justified]”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Factor 2: Hate and Harassment-Related Behaviors, reflecting individual self-reports of harassment and bullying based on protected identity markers such as religion, race, gender identity, and sexual orientation.&lt;/strong&gt; This factor displayed Cronbach’s alpha score of 0.769, indicating internal solid reliability across questions about bullying behaviors. This was a multiple-selection question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Q13: “I have bullied or harassed people based on their…” [Age, Class, Ethnicity/race, Nationality, Religion, Gender identity/expression, Sexual orientation, or All of the above.]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Factor 3: Bridging Capital, which looked at the reported levels of comfort in interacting with people of diverse identities, both in broader gaming spaces (Loose Ties - 3a) and in forming meaningful, strong relationships (Close Ties – 3b).&lt;/strong&gt; This was split into two factors following EFA. The internal consistency of 3a (Loose Ties) was high at 0.857, with Factor 3b (Close Ties) sub-factor also internally consistent at 0.695. Questions in each included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Loose Ties (3a), consisting of Q8: “I feel comfortable playing with people of different identities, including different…” [Same identity options as above, and “only people that share my identity”].&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Close Ties (3b), consisting of two questions: Q10_2, “I regularly engage in conversations online with people with different identities or backgrounds,” and Q10_3, “I have strong and meaningful friendships online with friends from different identities than mine”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Factor 4: Confronting Hate, including items about recognizing extremist content, reporting harmful behavior, and standing up for others being harassed.&lt;/strong&gt; This factor had acceptable internal reliability (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.680), confirming that knowledge of and action against hate in gaming spaces was consistently measured. Questions and responses in this factor included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Q16_2: “I can tell the difference between commonplace toxicity and extremist content online.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Q16_3: “I can tell the difference between online sexism and misogyny.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Q20_2: “I have reported harmful content in the last year.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Q22_1: “I have stood up for someone else being harassed online from my own community.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Q22_2: “I have stood up for someone else being harassed online from a different community.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Factor 5: Cultural Identity and Connectedness – Religion and Ethnicity, which looked at how those identity aspects shaped respondents’ behavior and sense of belonging in gaming spaces.&lt;/strong&gt; The internal consistency for this factor was slightly lower than expected (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.619), likely due to the heterogeneity of the items included. Further revisions were flagged, and we tested models with separate Religious and Ethnic identity factors, which improved the model fit at the expense of internal reliability. As such, we ultimately chose to keep this as one factor. Questions and responses that we built into this factor included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Q6_4: “The way I am living my life is guided by the traditions, beliefs, habits, and norms of my culture/ethnic group.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Q7_3: “My gamer identity represents the following: Ethnicity/race.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Q9_3: “I have actively sought/found communities based on similarity to my Ethnicity/race.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Q6_5: “Religion is important for me and guides me on how to behave in society.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Q7_5: “My gamer identity represents the following: Religion.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Q9_5: “I have actively sought/found communities based on similarity to my Religion.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Factor 6: Cultural Identity and Connectedness—Gender and Sexual Orientation, revealing how individuals’ community engagement reflected these aspects of their identities.&lt;/strong&gt; This factor showed lower internal reliability (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.591), but as a critical factor for the gender component of the study, we elected to keep it in the model. Notably, the larger study framework specifically focuses on gendered experiences of gaming identity, and qualitative research from other studies have noted the striking differences in experience of hate and harassment faced by different genders in gaming. As such, the research team chose to retain Factor 6 in the model. Questions and responses included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Q7_6: “My gamer identity represents the following: Gender identity/expression.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Q9_6: “I have actively sought/found communities based on similarity to my Gender identity/expression.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Q7_7: “My gamer identity represents the following: Sexual orientation.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Q9_7: “I have actively sought/found communities based on similarity to my Sexual orientation.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Factor 7: Cultural Identity and Connectedness—Gamer Identity, looking at how representative one’s gamer identity was of other identity factors, including age, class, ethnicity, nationality, religion, gender, and sexual orientation.&lt;/strong&gt; The reliability for this factor was weaker than the others (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.373) and would be considered unacceptably in terms of overall internal reliability. Given its importance to the study, we retained it for confirmatory factor analysis, but further revisions were considered. We ran confirmatory factor analyses with and without the gamer identity factor included, which did not distort the overall findings presented below. As gamer identity fusion has been posited as a predictor of support for extremist beliefs and dark triad behaviors, we also felt it was justifiable to retain the factor in final analysis (Kowert et al., 2022).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Q7: “My gamer identity represents the following…[Age, Class, Ethnicity/race, Nationality, Religion, Gender identity/expression, Sexual orientation, or All of the above]”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reliability tests affirmed the validity of most factors, though some (e.g., Factors 6 and 7) required additional scrutiny. Merging all identity factors into one factor significantly improved internal reliability (Cronbach Alpha score of 0.79), but created an unreliable overall factor model. Ultimately, we elected to use the above seven factors and one sub-factor (3b) above in the final BRAVED model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;results-and-analysis&quot;&gt;Results and analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;confirmatory-factor-analysis-cfa&quot;&gt;Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After ensuring internal construct validity, we conducted Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) in R to test our hypotheses: do the composite factors of create a valid model and, if so, which specific factors have the greatest effect on the overall composite measure? CFA is a statistical technique that allows researchers to examine the relationships between observed variables and their underlying constructs (the questions). CFA was carried out using the entire dataset collected from seven countries via using the “lavaan” package in R.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In CFA parlance, we hypothesized that resilience against VE is a second-order latent variable influenced by the first-order latent constructs, which are represented by the seven factors and one sub-factor. We used standardized factor scores to adapt for the variation in how many questions were included in each factor. Also, we added covariances for factors we expected would correlate, such as “Bridging Capital” with “Confronting Hate,” based on theoretical expectations from the literature on resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our use of CFA allowed us to assign relative resilience scores and categorize participants into “Low,” “Mid,” and “High” resilience groups based on the mean and standard deviation of their “Resilience” scores. Overall, the CFA fit indices are acceptable, suggesting that our model captures the underlying factor structure and aligns with our theoretical framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of measures of fit: Comparative Fit Index (CFI) was 0.905, indicating a good fit, as values closer to 1 are ideal. A CFI value above 0.90 is generally considered acceptable. The Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) was 0.896. Which is slightly below the commonly accepted threshold of 0.90 for a good fit, indicating some room for model improvement but close enough to a good value to provide merit. Meanwhile, RMSEA was 0.039, with a 90% confidence interval of 0.038 to 0.041. An RMSEA value below 0.05 suggests a close fit, supporting the model’s adequacy. Lastly, the Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) was a very acceptable 0.046. SRMR values less than 0.08 are considered robust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;primary-drivers-of-resilience&quot;&gt;Primary drivers of resilience&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 2 below and Figure 1 above outline the second-order factor loadings in the Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), detailing the relationship between factors (Intolerance, Hate, Harassment, Bridging Capital, etc.) and the overarching composite resilience against violent extremism construct. As a reminder, that composite measure is posited to include all the below factors as protective (positively coded and contributing to resilience) in nature exception of with hate-and-harassment related beliefs and behaviors (inversely, negatively coded and reducing resilience). These factor loadings help us understand how each contributes to our overall composite model of resilience to VE. The below analysis is presented in order of each factor’s strength of contribution grouped by protective (positive) factors and negative factors that reduced overall resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;protective-factors&quot;&gt;Protective factors&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Respondents who felt their lives – both in games and outside of them – were rooted in cultural and religious identities tended to have higher overall resilient scores than others. The compound religious and cultural identity factor had the greatest overall positive impact on resilience (+2.18) with high statistical significance. Based on our scorings, that meant that individuals with greater religious and ethnic identity and connectedness were less likely to exhibit hate and harassment-related beliefs and engage in targeted harassment based on protected characteristics. At the same time, they were more likely to have strong social capital ties (Bridging Capital) and to stand up to defend others online (Confronting Hate). We found that religious and cultural identities were intensely correlated, grouping them into a single factor for this analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other identity-based factors were the following most substantial protective factors in this study. The more respondents felt their gamer identity represented other identity characteristics, the more resilient they became across all other factors (+0.47). We asked how reflective their gamer identity was of their age, class, ethnicity/race, nationality, religion, gender identity/expression, and sexual orientation. A complex and multifaceted gamer identity, encompassing different aspects such as age, gender, ethnicity, and nationality, enhances overall resilience. We interpret this as the opposite effect of gamer identity fusion – in which a flattening of gamer identity occurs as it becomes the dominant identity factor and other layers matter less. Previous work by Kowert et al. (2022) has shown that such a fused identity correlates with increased support for VE (white supremacy, in particular). This builds on a wider evidence base inside which identity fusion is typically associated with susceptibility to violent extremist ideologies and organizational support (Gómez et al., 2011; Swann et al., 2009).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding rootedness and communities related to one’s gender expression and sexual orientation was also correlated with increased resilience in the model (+0.44). This was less significant (z-score = 3.33). However, we believe it is still robust enough to merit reporting on. Our question set looked at to what extent respondents’ gamer identity was reflected in their sexual orientation and gender expression and whether they actively sought out and found communities based on those identities (Connectedness). As this was also correlated with increased resilience across all factors, it appears that recognizing and supporting these identity layers matter for building resilient, supportive communities against VE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We examined confronting hate in gaming communities both in terms of knowledge (knowing the difference between toxicity and VE, as well as between run-of-the-mill sexism and misogyny), as well as in terms of action (reporting harmful content and standing up for others being harassed). Unsurprisingly, a higher propensity to confront hate increased overall resilience, though to a lesser extent than the identity factors (+0.36). Regardless, this finding supports a commonsense correlation that actively standing up against harassment and extremist content in gaming spaces is crucial for enhancing digital resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, in terms of protective factors, we found that loose connection forms of bridging capital also contributed to overall resilience (+0.23). We conceptualized loose social capital ties, conned by Granovetter (1973), as manifested in gaming settings by individuals comfortable playing with people of different identities (age, class, ethnicity/race, nationality, religion, gender identity/expression, and sexual orientation, or all of the above). This suggests that interactions with diverse individuals in gaming environments can build tolerance and empathy, similar to how diverse neighborhoods in urban settings tend to reduce racism and prejudice gradually (Tables 3–5).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;negative-factors&quot;&gt;Negative factors&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, and somewhat surprisingly, we found that higher levels of close-knit forms of bridging capital reduce overall resilience (−0.18). While the overall impact was less than that of other actors, it was statistically significant. We asked whether people had regular conversations online with people from different identities and backgrounds and if they had strong and meaningful friendships online with those types of people. Potentially, this could indicate that social contact theory has limitations in online settings – namely when those points of contact go beyond gaming and extend into regular conversations. However, this effect was highly dichotomous across countries in the sample. In Canada, close ties were associated with a + 0.43 impact positive increase in resilience. All other countries saw a negative impact, but the degree varied from nearly inconsequential in the US (−0.005) to profoundly negative in Indonesia (−0.47) and the UK (−0.39). Perhaps, in some settings, deeper engagement breeds hostility. In contrast, in others, it encourages the creation of pro-social bonds. Further research on this point in virtual settings is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, and rather uncontroversially, we found that holding both hate and harassment-related beliefs (−0.27) and behaviors (−0.44) in gaming settings were strongly and negatively associated with a decline in overall resilience. Specifically, we coded finding extremism and toxicity in gaming settings as culturally acceptable or justified as a hateful belief. Meanwhile, we coded self-reported bullying or harassing people based on a protected identity characteristic as hateful behavior. This aligns with existing research suggesting that intolerance, including toxic attitudes, increases susceptibility to extremist narratives. This finding underscores the importance of addressing and mitigating hate and harassment in digital spaces to foster a more resilient gaming community. Participation in or support of such targeted hate appears to weaken a host of other protective factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;discussion&quot;&gt;Discussion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;resilience-by-country-age-and-gender&quot;&gt;Resilience by country, age, and gender&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also examined variations in the contributions of each factor across particular demographic groups in our study, namely across country, age group, and gender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, we must note that these cross-country findings are purely exploratory in nature at this stage and do not account for a wide range of exogenous factors potentially impacting the scores in each country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across most countries, the majority of participants fall into the “Mid” resilience group, with percentages generally ranging from 71 to 86%. This pattern indicates a relatively moderate level of resilience across these countries. The results also provide a general resilience index for each country. Positive values (e.g., Australia, Indonesia, and the United States) indicate higher resilience, while negative values (e.g., Canada, Germany, France, and Great Britain) suggest a comparatively lower resilience among gamers that country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US and Indonesia are outliers in this study, exhibiting considerably higher resilience scores overall. In particular, both show notably higher percentages of highly resilient respondents (13.67% for ID and 25.89% for the US) than other countries. We also note that both of these countries were also those with the highest levels of exposure to violent extremist content and fundraising requests among our sample (a variable we discuss in our forthcoming reports on this dataset), suggesting that the protective effect of resilience in both could be even more substantial. We did not, however, see a statistically correlated relationship between exposure to violent extremist content and resilience, belying a causal relationship. Country-specific nuances in the two most resilience countries in our sample included the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the US, possessing hateful beliefs (viewing toxicity and extremism as accepted or justified features of gaming communities) was nearly four times as negatively impactful on overall resilience than elsewhere (−0.97 in the US versus −0.28 across all countries). Meanwhile, having bridging capital was far more essential to increase resilience in the US than elsewhere (+0.41 in the US for loose ties versus +0.23 elsewhere, and −0.005 for close ties versus −0.18 elsewhere). This suggests, perhaps, that when American gamers find a connection with others, it is potent in inoculating them against extremist ideological entreaties. But those who have hateful beliefs in the US are far more likely to see a precipitous loss in overall resilience: the highs are high, and the lows are low in America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Indonesia, meanwhile, possessing hateful beliefs (−0.11 vs. -0.27 across the sample) and engaging in hateful harassment (−0.20 vs. -0.44 across the sample) were both less impactful on overall resilience. Effects of other factors were also more muted, with religious and ethnic identity and connectedness contributing just +0.40 instead of +2.18 across all countries. Yet Indonesians were extremely unlikely to have low resilience scores overall. The bottom of the distribution curve effectively did not exist for Indonesia, with respondents falling into our mid- (86% of respondents) and high-resilience brackets (14% of respondents). Thus, the average resilience of Indonesian gamers is all the more striking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The country-specific breakdown of resilience scores reveals variations that could be tied to cultural, societal, and digital ecosystem differences in each location. For instance, the higher “High” resilience percentage in the US might reflect the influence of community support systems or digital literacy efforts within its gaming spaces. On the other hand, countries like France and Germany show a lower overall resilience index, pointing to potential areas where interventions might focus on enhancing digital resilience, particularly among youth. Other country-level differences may be explored in another analysis of this dataset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;resilience-by-age&quot;&gt;Resilience by age&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “Mid” resilience group dominates both age categories, with a slightly higher percentage in the 18–28 group (80.15%) compared to the 29–44 group (74.20%). The percentage of individuals in the “High” resilience group is somewhat more numerous in the older 29–44 age group (15.73%) than in the 18–28 group (14.55%). This indicates that a slightly higher proportion of older gamers may possess stronger resilience against extremist narratives in digital spaces. However, taken on average, the 18–28 age group (0.04) has a marginal but statistically significantly higher overall resilience than the older group (−0.04).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we examine specific factor differences between our younger and older cohort, we find that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Holding hate and harassment-related beliefs and behaviors are more detrimental to resilience among 29-44-year-olds (Beliefs: −0.40 in older cohort, −0.31 in younger; Behaviors: −0.59 in older cohort, −0.40 in younger).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having more loose connections and bridging capital benefits older cohorts more (+0.27 vs. + 0.20 for the younger group).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Possessing close connections in discussions and friendships with different groups negatively impacts resilience more among 18-28-year-olds (−0.44 versus −0.36 among older respondents).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, confronting hate is far more beneficial to overall resilience for 18-28-year-olds than for the older demographic (+0.74 versus +0.57 among 29–44).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identity factors were also less important contributors to resilience among 18–28 years olds than among 29-44-year-olds (Religion and Ethnicity Identity: +0.63 for youth compared to +1.33 for the older cohort; Sexual and Gender Identity: +0.37 for youth compared to +0.58; Gamer Identity: +0.13 for youth compared to +0.55). The substantial variance in the contribution of gamer identity complexity to resilience among the different ages is particularly interesting. The general pervasiveness of games has, perhaps, made them less of a point of identity distinction among younger audiences. Or, possibly, another explanation should be examined in future research: there is insufficient data to explain the difference fully from this study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resilience distribution across age groups implies that while most individuals remain in the moderate resilience category, age differences may influence how gamers perceive and confront extremism. The slightly higher resilience in the 29–44 group in the “High” category could be due to increased life experience, social network diversity, and potentially more extensive exposure to different viewpoints. Conversely, the negative overall score for older gamers indicates some risk factors exogenous to this study that may be specific to that cohort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;gendered-dynamics-of-resilience&quot;&gt;Gendered dynamics of resilience&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both male and female respondents predominantly fall into the “Mid” resilience group, with a slightly higher percentage of males (77.89%) than females (76.31%). Slightly more males are in the “High” resilience category (15.67%) compared to females (14.64%). However, once grouped into the “High” resilience group, women exhibit a slightly higher mean resilience score (1.59) than men (1.57), suggesting that when women exhibit strong resilience, they may be even more resistant to VE than their male counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, the mean resilience scores for the “Low” and “Mid” categories are somewhat more negative for females (−0.877 for “Low” and −0.245 for “Mid”) than for males (−0.867 for “Low” and −0.201 for “Mid”). This indicates that women in the lower resilience brackets might experience more vulnerability, which could be due to multiple gender dynamics or simply that they experience other exogenous risk factors, including far higher rates of targeted hate and harassment online, as well as gender-based violence facilitated by digital tools that undermine the presence of protective factors for males (Baekgaard, 2024).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall values for males (0.03) and females (−0.03) reveal an interesting contrast. While males have a slightly positive overall resilience score, females display a somewhat negative one, suggesting that the general resilience against VE might be lower among females in the gaming community. We may find some explanation for this when looking at the gendered differences among specific resilience factors, including that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Confronting hate contributes more to overall resilience for females (+0.66 F / +0.47 M).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gamer identity complexity contributes more than three times as much to resilience for females (+0.42 F / +0.13 M).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Holding stronger cultural identity and connectedness factors linked to gender identity and expression, along with sexual orientation, contributes more to resilience for females than males (+0.52 F / +0.45 M).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Religious and ethnic identity contributes less to resilience for females (+0.95 F / +0.1.177 M).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Engaging in harassment is less impactful to overall resilience for females (−0.49 F / −0.59 M).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gender differences in resilience highlight a nuanced reality in gaming spaces that intersect with the complex gendered inequalities that individuals bring with them into their gamer identities. Males show a marginally stronger overall resilience against VE, particularly regarding the distribution across resilience categories. However, females in the “High” resilience group exhibit slightly higher mean scores, indicating that can be quite robust when they develop resilience. The negative total score for females may reflect broader challenges they face in digital spaces, such as higher rates of harassment, gender-based violence, or exclusion from specific gaming communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This pattern underlines the importance of tailoring interventions and support mechanisms to address gender-specific vulnerabilities in digital environments, promoting inclusivity and strengthening resilience pathways for both males and females.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-role-of-gender-based-harassment-in-reducing-resilience&quot;&gt;The role of gender-based harassment in reducing resilience&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall lower resilience among females in the “Low” and “Mid” categories potentially points to the negative impact that gender-based harassment and exclusion from gaming communities have on their ability to resist extremist narratives. Females in gaming spaces often experience higher levels of toxicity, misogyny, and exclusion compared to their male counterparts (Kelly et al., 2021; Whakaatu, 2024). This can contribute to feelings of alienation, which may lower their resilience to extremist content and violent ideologies. Additionally, the negative relationship between Bridging Capital 2 (close social ties across diverse identity groups) and resilience among female gamers suggests that, for women, engagement with other communities may not always foster resilience, potentially due to the presence of ingrained sexism or exclusionary norms in these communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address these dynamics, interventions must focus on creating safer, more inclusive spaces for female gamers. Strategies such as gender-sensitive moderation protocols, the promotion of female role models in gaming, and the fostering of supportive online communities could provide protective mechanisms to strengthen resilience among female gamers. Additionally, platforms should implement anti-harassment measures tailored to address the specific vulnerabilities faced by female players. In focusing on addressing the gendered inequalities of gaming spaces to increase resilience, a result may be increased resilience for all gamers, as the allowance of hate-based harassment fundamentally harms the in- and out-groups (Wallner et al., 2023).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;active-confrontation-as-a-resilience-factor-for-women&quot;&gt;Active confrontation as a resilience factor for women&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the findings indicate that confront hate is decisive in building resilience among female gamers. This suggests that women may view taking an active stance against harassment or violence as an essential aspect of their resilience. In practice, female gamers may benefit from support systems that empower them to speak out against harmful behaviors or extremist content in their gaming communities. This could include tools for reporting harassment, opportunities for participating in collective action against toxic behavior, or initiatives that encourage women to take on leadership roles within gaming spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion---implications-for-building-resilience-against-violent-extremism-in-gaming-spaces&quot;&gt;Conclusion - implications for building resilience against violent extremism in gaming spaces&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study highlights several factors that contribute to resilience against VE in gaming spaces, offering valuable insights for policymakers, game developers, and preventing and countering violent extremism (P/CVE) practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;promoting-inclusive-community-building-to-foster-resilience&quot;&gt;Promoting inclusive community-building to Foster resilience&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The role of Bridging Capital (loose social ties with diverse identity groups) in fostering resilience is particularly significant. Gamers who have positive interactions with players from different backgrounds—whether ethnic, religious, or otherwise—demonstrate higher levels of resilience to extremist narratives. This suggests that creating inclusive gaming environments where players from diverse backgrounds can engage meaningfully is crucial for building digital resilience. Game developers, policymakers, and platforms should prioritize cross-cultural and cross-identity engagement, as well as facilitating community norm building that allows for inclusive gaming communities, to counter extremist ideologies in gaming spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the data also highlights that close social ties (Bridging Capital 2) can sometimes harm resilience, particularly for female gamers and in specific cultural contexts such as Indonesia. This suggests that “echo chambers” within gaming spaces, where players are insulated from diverse perspectives, may reinforce exclusionary or extremist attitudes. Therefore, efforts to foster resilience should also encourage open, inclusive dialogue rather than creating insular, homogeneous groups. Safe spaces matter – but should not be the exclusive option provided to users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-role-of-cultural-identity-in-strengthening-resilience&quot;&gt;The role of cultural identity in strengthening resilience&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cultural identity also emerges as an essential factor in resilience. Players who have a strong sense of their own cultural and religious identities tend to demonstrate higher resilience to extremist narratives. This finding underscores the importance of allowing gamers to express their cultural identities freely within gaming spaces. In particular, players from countries like the United States and Australia, where ethnic and religious identity played a significant role in resilience scores, could benefit from initiatives that celebrate diversity and promote pride in cultural heritage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P/CVE practitioners could work with game developers to create in-game content that reflects diverse cultural experiences and fosters pride in one’s identity. By doing so, gaming platforms can serve as spaces where players feel empowered in their cultural identities, rather than alienated, thus increasing their resilience to extremist ideologies that seek to exploit feelings of marginalization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;empowering-gamers-to-confront-extremism&quot;&gt;Empowering gamers to confront extremism&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the role of active confrontation in resilience is noteworthy across gender and age groups. Gamers who actively confront harmful behaviors or extremist content in their communities have higher resilience scores. This finding suggests that empowering players to take a stand against extremism—through reporting tools, community moderator support systems, or peer-led initiatives—can significantly bolster their resilience. Platforms should invest in tools that make it easier for players to report harmful content and offer incentives for players who actively contribute to creating a safer, more inclusive gaming environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing inspiration from the work of Alexis de Tocqueville, CSIS Futures Lab sees an emergent role for artificial intelligence (AI) benchmarking—independent studies that test and evaluate AI performance in domain-specific tasks—as a new mechanism for ensuring accountability in a free society. Through adapting Tocqueville’s concept of association, AI agents can be held accountable, thus ensuring a more open and transparent society. For Tocqueville, association was the “mother science” of life in a democracy that illuminated moral truths, fostered public virtue, and guarded against social isolation. In a world of algorithmic reasoning, association is no longer confined to human debates in the public square: It has taken on a technical dimension that involves testing and evaluating AI foundation models to help the body politic understand their strengths and weaknesses as well as push firms to fine-tune their models to meet specific user needs. This process must be independent and transparent to ensure the free exchange of ideas in a democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, AI benchmarking is a central task in a free society that embraces AI technology. Furthermore, to preserve its independence, the process should be open and free of direct government or business sector control. True association is bottom-up and maximizes transparency and accountability. In an era where individual actors—whether analysts or citizens—are increasingly reliant on opaque agentic workflows, collective action through transparent, domain-specific model evaluation is essential. Without such associations to mediate the influence of AI in national security and foreign policy, decisionmaking risks becoming centralized, brittle, and divorced from democratic oversight. Worse still, the polarization that defines online discourse in the modern United States will be overrun by narrow, self-interested factions convinced of the rightness of their causes by never-ending feedback loops of tailored information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seen in this light, there is a mix of public and private sector action needed to create a world where technology and democracy are co-constituted and thrive, a new town square where algorithms help mitigate—as opposed to reinforce—bias and create the possibility of open dialogue and civic association. First, the public sector needs to pursue legislation that encourages private sector, independent model benchmarking. This push should include a mix of funding for efforts at nonprofits, including universities, and exploring which congressional committee has the authorities to call for routine hearings on model benchmarks. Second, legislators should encourage collaboration between civil society and AI firms through experimenting with legal incentives. Third, and most importantly, the United States’ foundations need to come together to fund multiple benchmarking initiatives to preserve the independence of this modern form of association and accountability. To ensure its role in holding algorithms accountable, benchmarking should be free of both government and industry interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is 20XX. A defense analyst struggles to keep up with the array of incoming information on adversary troop movements near a contested border region. A combination of autonomous systems, infantry units, and air assets are already in the area. Moreover, some reports suggest that the adversary may be preparing precision long-range strike capabilities targeting the contested border, should a conflict break out. Pressured to demonstrate their resolve by an array of computational propaganda bots amplifying extreme nationalist views, political leaders on both sides have implied that they will not back down in the dispute. However, the analyst has been made aware that backdoor negotiations are underway in an attempt to avoid further crisis escalation. Circumstances are unfolding rapidly, uncertainty is high, and defense leaders are demanding a recommended course of action from the analyst immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analyst is equipped with a decision support agent leveraging live intelligence feeds, other relevant information, and a large language model (LLM)-enabled natural language chat interface. Based on the current information and its underlying training data, the decision support system recommends that an escalatory policy, in which use of force occurs, is the best course of action. The analyst, however, is hesitant. Her gut says to avoid escalatory behavior, but the decision support system is pushing for the exact opposite. Her superiors are increasingly demanding of her recommendation due to tight operational timelines, but she is unsure of the exact reasoning behind the decision support system’s recommendation to use force. Moreover, she is not abreast of the data and training processes the system has undergone. While the final decision on what to recommend does lay in her hands, she is worried that her decision is being nudged toward a course of action by a complicated system she does not entirely understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily in this case, the situation was simply a crisis simulation helping benchmark a new decision support agent within an AI-enabled military command system. However, the tensions that are a part of this fictional scenario are increasingly very real. And they extend beyond national security to economics, energy policy, and even online discourses that shape how people mobilize in their communities and exercise their right to vote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both citizens and government institutions around the world are experimenting with integrating AI agents into their daily lives, including in decisionmaking contexts. AI agents that perceive the environment, make decisions, and recommend actions are increasingly ubiquitous, further blurring the line between human and machine. As a consequence, it is likely that, in the near future, defense and foreign policy analysts, as well as city councils and even individual voters, will be faced with the question of whether to trust AI agents in critical circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resulting situation leaves society at large with a choice. Citizens and institutions could passively rely on opaque and complicated systems that harness AI agents to augment decisionmaking. Alternatively, a free people could endeavor to achieve an active approach to broad and robust civic engagement with such systems to better understand, evaluate, and shape human-machine interactions in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report argues for the second option and suggests that it is unwise to leave either the public or the private sector to be the sole arbitrators for evaluating the use of AI agents, especially when such agents inform political and national security decisions. A fundamental element to implementing this approach will be successfully developing methodologies for continuous and robust benchmarking and evaluation of AI foundation models and derivative agents in contexts where ground truth may not exist, information is subject to abrupt change, and uncertainty reigns. Moreover, such approaches must be transparent, plural, and feature shared responsibility across a broad spectrum of U.S. society. No one party, no one government agency, and no single corporate cabal should control the ability of free people to exchange ideas and shape their society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Processes of benchmarking and evaluation can be developed and practiced not only as abstract technical or regulatory tasks, but also—and primarily—as a form of civil association essential to preserving democratic judgment in an era of increasing digital dependency. That is the core proposition of this report and its recommendations for ensuring that the benchmarking process is free from government or industry control and influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make its case, this report revisits Tocqueville’s arguments about U.S. society from his work Democracy in America, as well as other writings in democratic theory, political philosophy, and governance, suggesting that such perspectives can inform an approach on model benchmarking and evaluation that incorporates civil society and leverages the associative potential of different forms of actors across the United States to build a robust and accountable space for agentic AI to flourish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tocquevilles-warning-and-the-civil-society-imperative&quot;&gt;Tocqueville’s Warning and the Civil Society Imperative&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though first published in the nineteenth century, Tocqueville’s Democracy in America holds contemporary relevance for thinking about how to ensure democratic accountability in the era of agentic AI. Two related factors are most pertinent to this report: (1) the possible detrimental effects of isolation, and (2) the corrective and beneficial consequences of associations. These factors are relevant in the context of AI agents in that delegating social action to AI could increase isolation and reduce human agency in governance decisions absent proper benchmarking and fine-tuning. However, robust collective human involvement within processes of agentic AI development and evaluation hold the potential to make the integration of agentic AI into society an associational process, thus reducing isolation rather than exacerbating it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his study, Tocqueville expressed concern regarding isolation in democratic life. Because democracies emphasize equality among citizens, each person is free to pursue their own interests and desires. The result is a generally individualistic social structure. Individualism, in the context of agentic AI, further incentivizes the risk of abdicating governance decisions to technology as citizens see to their own individual lives and daily priorities. The consequence could include leaving technological development and implementation to private companies and government actors with little-to-no public input.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Tocqueville, despite citizen equality, left to their own devices, equity and individualism can also lead to isolation—and isolation can lead to weakness and the threat of despotism. As he argued, “the vices fostered by tyranny are exactly those supported by equality. These two things are complementary and mutually supportive, with fatal results.” Moreover, apart from the risk of tyranny, Tocqueville wrote that isolation leads to impotence in that alone, “citizens can achieve almost nothing.” As AI agents are increasingly deployed across public and private life, further isolation could easily lead to a public that simply—even unconsciously—accepts a version of AI’s integration into practices of governance that challenge democratic principles and limit human capacity to exercise political agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Tocqueville, the counterweight to the consequences of isolation and its threat to democratic governance was the formation of civil associations between citizens to take on problems of mutual concern, generate social cohesion, and foster care for others within an otherwise individualistic context. The goals of associations can range from building local community centers to variable commercial interests, among many others, in which citizens realize and pursue common bonds. Tocqueville emphasized the critical nature of associations, writing “in democratic countries, the knowledge of how to form associations is the mother of all knowledge since the success of all others depends on it.” Thus, the fear is a surrender to a despotic state if associations, and their various positive effects, fail to form. Accordingly, within the context of agentic AI, associations can serve as a key check against the narrow interests of society’s most powerful actors and even foster collective democratic practices guiding the technology’s development and deployment in a fashion that has diffuse benefits across the U.S. public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tocqueville’s discussion of the risk of isolation and the need for association creates a framework for thinking about how to balance the efficiency gains of AI agents with the desire to maintain a free society. In a range of contexts, AI agents are replacing expert judgments and determining important life outcomes, including in the domains of medicine, bank loans, and even governance decisions, among others. If broader society passively—and uncritically—accepts algorithmically shaped decisionmaking procedures, it risks surrendering to an antidemocratic version of algorithmic governance, or a way of “social ordering” that incorporates algorithmic procedures into decisionmaking in which these computational systems may opaquely shape government processes and life outcomes. As one assessment suggests, “advances in machine-learning—or artificial intelligence—portend a future in which many governmental decisions will no longer be made by people, but [rather] by computer-processed algorithms,” presenting an “emerging threat” to liberty and democracy. To map this on to Tocqueville’s framework, instead of surrendering to the pull of tyrannical government, absent the corrective forces of associations, broader democratic society risks surrendering to an antisocial, nondemocratic version of algorithmic governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, scholars have shown that civil society can act as a pillar of accountability and an additional form of checks and balances within governance structures. For this reason, a brief review of social scientific work on the relationship between civil society and governance, as well as the possible impact of technology, is a useful exercise. While the modern version of the term “civil society” has been deployed at least as far back as the late eighteenth century, more contemporary expressions of the term, particularly in the work of U.S. political scientist Robert Putnam, have had broader impact in popular discussions of modern democracy. As U.S. sociologist Larry Diamond argued in 1994, “no phenomenon has more vividly captured the imagination of democratic scholars, observers, and activists alike than ‘civil society.’” For the purposes of this discussion, following Larry Diamond’s definition, civil society refers to sets of organized social groups that members voluntarily join, create, and support, and that are generally autonomous from the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scholars have attempted to demonstrate the important role that civil society can play in shaping political outcomes. For example, Putnam’s work on civil society in Italy argues that robust networks of civic engagement hold a range of benefits for social cooperation, including increasing defection costs, fostering norms of reciprocity, and demonstrating the benefits of community collaboration. In turn, he suggests that this form of civic activity—and the subsequent development of social capital—supports high-functioning democratic institutions. Putnam expands his argument beyond Italy. Drawing from Tocqueville, Putnam argues, “Tocqueville was right: democratic government is strengthened, not weakened, when it faces vigorous civil society.” As summed up by sociologist Sydney Tarrow, Putnam’s basic argument is that “for where there is no social capital … democracy cannot flourish.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other scholars also emphasize the important links between civil association, democracy, and the spread of liberal norms and values. The study of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) is a prominent example of the relationship between governance and civil society organizations. Scholars focusing on international politics have argued, for instance, that NGOs work as key norm entrepreneurs for the expansion of liberal human rights regimes. Moreover, NGOs can constrain government action by applying public pressure through advocacy (i.e., naming and shaming), increasing the normative costs for pursuing policies that result in things such as human rights abuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from internationally oriented NGOs, researchers contest that, under the right conditions—such as sufficient levels of free press and political competition—robust and active civil society organizations can reduce government corruption and increase accountability. Moreover, civil society organizations can participate in processes of public oversight and information sharing that can increase the transparency and accountability of governing institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The picture, however, is not always so clear, and the impact of technology, particularly digital technology, on civil associations and democracy remains murky. Spanish social theorist Manuel Castells, for example, notes that technological changes have introduced a “networked society” that has fundamentally altered communicative practices and transformed “space and time in the human experience.” As such, technological changes have altered the basic ways in which individuals and groups in societies are linked together. Scholars express different perspectives on how technological factors will shape the role and structure of civil society. Some, such as technology expert Lee Rainie and sociologist Barry Wellman, suspect that such technological changes, particularly in the form of information and communication technologies (ICTs), improve the prospects of robust socialization and community building. Others argue that ICTs offer the prospect of more impactful activism in restricted political environments due to ICTs’ capacity to “facilitate open and inclusive participation.” Still other scholars express concern over the role that technology will play in social organizations and democratic structures. Returning to Castells, he suggests that one consequence of the networked society could be a destruction of organizations and the “delegitimating” of institutions, leading to the prospect of social alienation. Moreover, research finds that, in some contexts, social media can decrease satisfaction with democracy, and scholars studying authoritarianism have argued that digital technologies can increase state capacity for repression of democratic freedoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of additional importance is the co-constitutive relationship between science, technology, and society. All too commonly, technology is treated simply as a variable (or tool) that impacts the social world in a direct way. Thus, in terms of civil society, technologies such as the internet will either help or hurt such organizations. Yet, the relationship is far more dynamic and dependent “on a complex pattern of interactions” between the social and technological. The majority of peoples’ interactions with each other and their environment are increasingly mediated through technology in general, and AI agents in particular. Humans may have made AI, but AI agents shape how people interact with their world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few examples from the daily practices of scientific laboratories as well as broader implementations of technology in public policy domains will help to illustrate this point. Social theorists Bruno Latour and Steve Woolgar demonstrate that even within the most pure scientific location—i.e., the laboratory—social factors still shape and direct scientific findings. Others, such as political theorist Langdon Winner, discuss how technologies are not neutral artifacts, but, in fact, can have crucial implications for power relationships and political outcomes within broader society. The intentional construction of bridges in Long Island, New York, to be too short for buses to pass under illustrates the role technology can play in power (and political) relationships. The goal in limiting the availability of public transportation in this way was to restrict poorer, typically minority, populations from accessing beaches and public areas served by the roads, as these groups commonly relied on public transit over more expensive modes of transportation, such as the automobile. Moreover, technological discoveries are not divorced from the social structures of power in which they are produced, and broader social imaginations of technology can shape the direction of technological developments. The upshot of these wider effects is that there are critical choices to be made in technological design, implementation, and execution that, as those decisions are shaped by broader social structures and sequences of interactions, also have far-reaching social and political impacts. As Winner writes, “technologies are ways of building order in our world.” Thus, when applied to the question of the relationship between AI—specifically agentic AI decisionmaking—and civil society, associational politics can play a crucial role in building socio-technical orders that favor democratic outcomes and processes. However, this will not happen automatically. In simple terms, it is imperative to proactively create a relationship between AI and society that enables democracy and responds effectively to the political interests of everyday people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relationship between robust civil association and democracy is further complicated by empirical work that responded to Putnam’s initial arguments suggesting robust civil society was the tonic for democratic governance. For example, a range of studies have documented cases in which civil society organizations have had detrimental effects on democratic outcomes. U.S. political scientist Sheri Berman’s work on civil society in the German Weimar period, for example, illustrates how the Nazi party was able to co-opt aspects of robust German civil organizations in a fashion that supported the rise of fascism. Further research demonstrates similar dynamics in Spain and Italy during the end of the nineteenth and into the twentieth century. Consequently, contextual and historical factors matter in how strong civic associations shape democratic outcomes. While Putnam did emphasize this fact, he was perhaps wrong in then generalizing the relationship of civic association, social capital, and democracy to other cases so deterministically. Yet, while we might not be able to isolate a consistent democratic effect of associations across time and space, this does not mean that civic associations and civil society cannot serve as practical tools in a larger tool kit for addressing broader issues of accountability and transparency related to artificial intelligence. Here we can draw lessons from the political theory of American pragmatism, which emphasizes social problem-solving oriented around joint public goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pragmatism highlights the “diversity of perspectives that different individuals and organizations bring to the definition of the problems, and to the generation of possible solutions.” As U.S. political scientist Christopher Ansell notes, “pragmatism is usefully described as a philosophy of evolutionary learning. It emphasizes the ability of both individuals and communities to improve their knowledge and problem-solving capacity over time through continuous inquiry, reflection, deliberation, and experimentation.” While pragmatism is dynamic in its broader philosophical commitments, a constant thread, particularly when connected to public-oriented governance, is an “emphasis on the open-ended process of refining values and knowledge.” In addition, this line of theory suggests the critical nature of learning through encountering tangible problems that require resolution, sometimes referred to as a “problem situation,” a context in which actors must creatively and experimentally find resolutions to new dilemmas. In fact, some scholars have emphasized how pragmatist philosophy can link practical, solution-oriented approaches to “grand problems” with high levels of complexity and uncertainty by offering a “situated, distributed, and processual approach to problem solving.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This deliberative, action-oriented, experimental view can be supported by associational politics emphasized by Tocqueville, as well as by more contemporary lessons from scholarship on civil society. Consequently, it’s worth synthesizing some of the above discussion into more concise takeaways. Fundamentally, from Tocqueville to modern research on democracy, under the right conditions, civil society groups have been shown to be important component parts of governance due to their capacity to unify citizen interests and improve the accountability and transparency of governing organizations. As a caution, however, research also demonstrates that civic organizations are not simply vacant objects of social good; they need specific social forces oriented toward democratic action. To draw on U.S. philosopher John Dewey, democracy is not something that perpetuates itself automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, civil associations need to be positioned around democratic goals and social action. One way is to orient organizations toward joint problems facing large cross-sections of democratic society, including the case of governing and evaluating AI systems. Deliberation and communication will be fundamental to this form of associative politics, as through these processes actors can realize joint interests and civil associations can vocalize and propose creative solutions to communal problems. While technology can complicate these relationships, experimental problem-solving can create a link between society and technology that nudges the development of AI toward accountability, transparency, and democracy. Critically, if people, firms, and government entities are going to use AI agents to inform decisions, of paramount importance is transparency and accountability related to the information and technological systems used to make those decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;model-benchmarking-as-a-new-art-of-association&quot;&gt;Model Benchmarking as a New Art of Association&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New forms of association can play important roles in combating the consequences of a passively accepted version of algorithmic governance, and its subsequent detrimental impact on democratic society. One such connection is in the practice of benchmarking and evaluating AI models. Though this report leverages the empirical domain of national security as an example because it is the research team’s area of expertise, this argument applies to other areas of governance and society more broadly speaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin this conversation, it’s worth reviewing what benchmarking is. Benchmarks are datasets designed to evaluate model performance on a specific set of tasks. The processes of benchmarking and evaluating models have become increasingly important as models are deployed in a range of situations that have real-world consequences. Successful benchmarking and evaluation of models not only allow for tracking model improvements but can also identify risks of models that do not perform at an adequate level for the desired use-case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, benchmarks have been developed to test model performance on tasks such as knowledge recall, quantitative reasoning, and other academic tasks. Other benchmarks focus on harmful social biases with respect to gender or race. Additionally, the research team at the CSIS Futures Lab has developed a benchmark, and associated methodology, for tracking model preferences with respect to critical foreign policy decisions in contexts such as crisis escalation scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Successful evaluation processes can be made more robust through associative practices that unite diverse teams of researchers, policymakers, and civil society actors to steer technological development away from opaque technological systems and toward a form of social organization in which AI public literacy is high, and a wide range of players have a say in the form of technology that is deployed in the public domain. In more tangible terms, this will require ongoing processes of domain-specific data creation and the testing and evaluation of models before and after deployment in contextually relevant scenarios. Key to the practice of benchmarking is the fact that, as Raji et al. argue, “the imagined artifact of a ‘general’ benchmark does not actually exist … presenting any single dataset in this way is ultimately dangerous and deceptive.” Moreover, issues of construct validity—“the degree to which a test or measurement tool accurately measures the construct it intends to measure”—and certain private sector actors successfully gaming benchmark results can problematically skew the reality of model performance. Such conclusions point to the critical nature of having a wide range of experts and actors in the evaluative process of benchmarking highly specialized, yet broadly critical, domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, such processes must be overseen by organizations with the public’s interest at heart. Here, the information environment will be fundamental. Returning to Tocqueville, information sharing is critical for successful association to occur. Only through making interests and opinions of individuals available for consumption in the public domain can joint interests be realized and successful associations forged. In Tocqueville’s era, local newspapers, as well as townhalls, were the key vector for information transfer. While a broader range of communicative technologies exists today, a core lesson is clear—without communicating facts of interest to broader publics, the risk of isolation increases. When applied to AI, and specifically the task of benchmarking and evaluation, this means transparency and broad-based communication of technological risks and uses are essential to ensuring the public’s interest. Binding interested actors into a dense, yet transparent, web of association has the potential to shape AI’s use in governance away from the consequences of “dead hand” algorithmic governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Absent a form of Tocquevillian association related to AI development, the risk is that social passivity gives way to co-option and control of this general-purpose technology to private interests, ceding technological development to a narrower set of goals driven by a select few. Robust associative politics centered around the technology of AI, specifically with respect to evaluation and benchmarking, increase the probability of a strong democratic process working in coordination with efforts of integrating and developing new technologies. This is important as research illustrates that socio-technical relationships structure human agency and can have path-dependent effects as certain relational structures become stabilized, a process in science and technology studies frequently called closure. Because the contemporary era is one in which socio-technical relations with respect to AI are still somewhat flexible, broader U.S. society has its greatest opportunity to structure a relationship more favorable to public—democratic—interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-general-review-of-us-ai-policy&quot;&gt;A General Review of U.S. AI Policy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any attempt to initiate a process of associational benchmarking must embed itself within ongoing policy developments in AI. The last three presidential administrations have proposed a range of approaches to both governing AI and incentivizing its integration across the private and public sectors. A review of these developments will provide a basis for building out the associative model of benchmarking governance discussed below. In 2019, Trump signed an executive order (EO) entitled “Maintaining American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence.” This order had a number of goals, including providing a foundation for AI innovation; integrating AI across federal agencies; fostering collaboration between government, the private sector, and academia; and developing technical standards, with the National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST) acting as the coordinating agency. The order sought to balance an innovation-friendly context for AI with the need to protect civil liberties and U.S. values. While the EO established a set of AI-related objectives, some criticized it for lacking details on both funding and practical implementation. That said, later in 2019, the Trump administration released the National AI R&amp;amp;D Strategic Plan: 2019, which outlined a strategy of federal investment into the research and development of AI. The plan included eight specific goals supporting the earlier EO: making long-term investments in AI research; better understanding how AI and humans can work together; addressing ethical and societal implications of the technology; advancing the security and safety of AI; developing data sets for technology development; evaluating AI through standards and benchmarks; seeing to workforce implications; and fostering public-private partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the first Trump administration’s efforts related to AI policy mention the need to establish fair, transparent, accountable, and ethical AI, the Biden administration furthered such efforts through the release of what the administration termed a “Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights” in 2022. This framework underscored the threats advances in AI posed to democratic processes and the rights of U.S. citizens, specifically related to bias and privacy. To attempt to address such issues, the Biden administration, led by the Office of Science and Technology Policy, identified five principles guiding “the design, use, and deployment of automated systems.” These principles were that AI systems should be safe and effective, that AI systems should not propagate biases or discrimination, that there must be protections from abusive data practices, that users should be aware when they are interacting with an automated system, and finally, that there should be clear human alternatives and fallbacks for any problems users have when interacting with AI-enabled systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This served as a platform for the eventual signing of the Biden administration’s 2023 EO “Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence.” The 2023 EO focused on ensuring that the United States remained the leader in “safe, ethical, and responsible” AI use and, to that end, directed federal agencies to establish processes “managing dual-use AI models, implementing rigorous testing protocols for high-risk AI systems, enforcing accountability measures, safeguarding civil rights, and promoting transparency across the AI lifecycle.” An additional key event occurring alongside the Biden EO was the establishment of the U.S. AI Safety Institute (U.S. AISI), a part of NIST, which was tasked with testing models, conducting red-teaming, and attempting to identify risks from increasingly advanced systems, including those with national security implications. Moreover, following guidance from the initial EO, in 2024, the administration released a memo focused on integrating AI into the national security enterprise in a fashion that both leveraged technological advances while also protecting human and civil rights. The Biden administration’s efforts continued through the final days of his presidency, with a second EO released in January of 2025, focusing on AI infrastructure and directing federal agencies to find eligible lands that could be used for “frontier AI” data centers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following Trump’s election to a second term, the new administration quickly sought to stamp its authority on the direction of U.S. AI policy. The Trump administration quickly revoked elements of the Biden administration’s executive action, suggesting that the latter had imposed “onerous and unnecessary government control over the development of AI.” The Trump team replaced Biden’s executive guidance with an EO entitled “Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence.” This late-January 2025 EO positioned the Trump administration, at least in terms of rhetoric, as far more innovation friendly than its predecessors. Furthermore, the EO provided guidance that relevant agency heads, as well as various presidential technology advisers, should review actions described within the Biden EO for revision or rescindment. The 2025 Trump EO, while short and relatively scant on details, directed the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to release additional guidance on AI implementation throughout the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following this directive, in the spring of 2025, the OMB released two memos further laying out the Trump administration’s approach to AI policy. In general terms, the memos contain guidance for federal agencies to speed up AI innovation and adoption in relevant use cases while also improving public trust in the technology. Moreover, and in contrast to initial indications from the Trump administration, the OMB memos shared many elements with previous Biden policies. One significant change in the policy, however, is the combining of issues related to “rights” and “safety” impacting AI into a single category called “high-impact AI.” That said, as described by a Brookings report, “the continuity [between administrations] is more striking than the change” as both administrations’ approaches appear similar on issues such as technology acquisition and the promotion of AI use throughout government. Yet, a June 2025 change may illustrate the Trump team’s desire to appear more innovation friendly with respect to AI: The AISA has been renamed the Center for AI Standards and Innovation (CAISI). According to the CAISI, the organization will act as the “primary point of contact” for industry members in the U.S. government to assist with testing, securing, and implementing AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, as indicated by the above review, AI policy in the United States is progressing. However, civil society and robust benchmarking practices must serve as checks and balances to ensure that the technology functions as intended for broader society. Positioning the United States as a leading AI superpower should be accompanied less by regulation than by a robust benchmarking effort that brings civil society into the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-case-of-ai-in-foreign-policy-decisionmaking&quot;&gt;The Case of AI in Foreign Policy Decisionmaking&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make this more tangible, the following section relies on an empirical discussion of the Futures Lab’s efforts at benchmarking model preferences in foreign policy decisionmaking contexts as well as a review of literature in the field of international relations focusing on the relationship between civil society and foreign policy decisionmaking. Research in international relations has long explored the links between democratic regime type and foreign policy outcomes. For example, democratic peace theory suggests that democracies, whether as a result of institutional structures or normative elements, tend to not go to war with one another. Other scholars have illustrated that, due to fear of electoral punishment, public opinion related to foreign policy can shape leader preferences, particularly when issue salience is high. However, research has also illustrated that the type of information environment—specifically how information flows from political elites to publics—is critical to the extent to which publics can constrain decisionmakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, advances in digital technology have led some to argue that the constraining effects of democratic publics on elite decisionmakers may be eroded as constituents are further “fragmented and siloed” so that voters support their leaders, regardless of the leaders’ policy decisions. Thus, drawing on the field of international relations, research illustrates that mechanisms for constraining foreign policy decisionmakers can be created within democracies; however, information environments, particularly in the context of the internet, can challenge these processes of constraint. To put this into simple terms, while there are ways to ensure that democratic publics can influence foreign policy decisions, digital technologies present novel challenges to that relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, advances in AI have the potential to further erode feedback mechanisms between democratic publics and foreign policy experts as the technology is integrated into foreign policy decisionmaking. The Futures Lab’s findings related to its benchmarking of LLMs in foreign policy decision contexts can assist in illustrating this point. Results from the Critical Foreign Policy Decisions (CFPD) benchmark demonstrate that some LLMs are significantly more escalatory in decision scenarios when compared to other models. For example, models such as DeepSeekV2, Qwen2 72B, and Llama 3.1 8B Instruct all tend to prefer recommending the use of force when compared to other LLMs included in the study. These escalatory preferences are particularly salient in scenarios where models are prompted to recommend courses of action for democratic countries, like the United States and United Kingdom, versus autocratic countries, such as China and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine a scenario in which models are integrated into decision pathways (and are not continuously and robustly evaluated for their risk profiles in a transparent fashion) and nudge decisionmakers toward escalation, in the context of, for example, a Taiwan Strait crisis. While it is highly unlikely that LLMs would ever make such a critical decision alone, if models are leveraged to generate possible courses of action, and they are primed to favor the use of force, decisionmakers could be unknowingly constrained in looking for more peaceful pathways to crisis resolution. Moreover, consider a situation in which private organizations and government institutions are left to evaluate model performance, without any oversight. Absent robust transparent processes of evaluatingmodels, such circumstances could lead to pathological outcomes as private companies seek to overpromise on system performance for financial gains and government institutions endeavor to avoid political consequences from deploying unreliable systems. For example, scholars have noted that private companies may be incentivized to keep critical information, such as code, in machine learning algorithms private both to increase profit and to avoid regulatory roadblocks. Moreover, bureaucratic organizations can, at times, have issues with accountability due to political calculations and the pursuit of narrow institutional interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much like Tocqueville’s warning about the adverse effects of isolation and passive obedience, broader civil society, in a nonassociative form and restricted from involvement in practices of evaluating AI agents, may be left to believe claims that systems work reliably and in an unbiased, rational fashion. In such a situation, the public may lack the capabilities to go behind the curtain and access data in a transparent and accountable way. Or, to draw on Tocqueville, “a tyrant is relaxed enough to forgive his subjects for failing to love him, provided they do not love one another.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expanding on Tocqueville’s analysis, the solution will involve tightly binding together civil society actors (ranging from local organizations to mainstream think tanks, research organizations, and beyond) into the processes of benchmarking and evaluating models for use cases relevant to their interests. While regulations, in terms of incentivizing government and private organizations to participate in the process, will be an element of such a vision, a more critical factor will be establishing a culture of civil involvement in influencing how the technology of AI will shape governance in the United States. This applies to cases as diverse as foreign policy to issues of local government. As the following section will outline, a civil culture dedicated to open and transparent forms of AI development is more likely to shape technological—and social—developments in a direction more conducive to robust democratic governance in a context in which AI permeates many decisionmaking domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;civil-society-in-the-age-of-ai-indirect-impacts-and-democratic-renewal&quot;&gt;Civil Society in the Age of AI: Indirect Impacts and Democratic Renewal&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tocqueville argued that “as soon as communal affairs are treated as belonging to all, every man realizes that he is not as separate from his fellows as he first imagined.” This broad social realization is key to driving the development of associative action and the building up of a plural set of actors in U.S. society that are involved in the iterative and transparent evaluation of models. Associative behavior, however, must be cultivated. That said, its impacts can be recursive in form. Not only do associations mitigate the threats of isolation, but they also train citizens to be engaged in issues of joint concern and to hold a civic mindset. To draw on John Dewey, such practices must become “a way of life,” or as Tocqueville put it, “an imperceptible influence of habit.” In other words, a collective effort of Americans to ensure technology works for the average citizen must be encouraged and normalized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his work on U.S. civil society, Robert Putnam asked, “is technology … driving a wedge between our individual interests and our collective interests?” This is a critical question, and while technology certainly can have this effect—see for example research illustrating that social media can contribute to problematic political polarization—there must be room for an alternative path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Benchmarking thus can serve as a practical vector for cultivating an associative, civic mindset related to the technology of AI and its relationship with governance to achieve meaningful results. In other words, benchmarking holds the potential to become a critical site of association in which collaborative spaces are generated for policy experimentation matched with public oversight through robust and dynamic evaluation methodologies. Simply put, benchmarking is a tool to ensure the public is aware of the impact that AI is having on their everyday lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if AI is going to be involved in making decisions on how certain social benefits are provided, there is no reason why interested members or representatives of the community should not be involved in the evaluative process of system development and be kept abreast of what evaluation results mean for the AI-enabled decisions that could shape life outcomes. This claim is not new; some researchers have already committed to a vision of community-oriented AI development in which AI systems are cocreated with local communities. This vision will undoubtably require a substantial measure of civic responsibility. Therefore, the benefits for communities of interest should not only be made clear; they must also be tangible. AI-enabled systems must feature accountable and transparent feedback loops that are responsive when algorithmic decision systems are failing. Absent such processes, broader democratic society is likely to fail the “tragic double bind” of governing algorithms while “governing by algorithms,” as technology researchers Maciej Kuziemski and Gianluca Misuraca put it. In such processes, large private tech organizations cannot be ignored. Yet, it is possible that, despite economic interests and with the right incentives, companies may prove to be amenable partners. Large AI firms have already set up industry organizations to share best practices in model assessment and agreed to a set of voluntary commitments regarding model performance in public domains, although issues of transparency and accountability remain. Mapping market incentives to civic responsibility will undoubtably be a future challenge in generating an open, plural, and transparent evaluation environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, there is potential for domain-specific, diverse associational methodologies of evaluation to emerge from below. As suggested by literature focusing on the role of civil society, such associations can serve as an injection of collective democratic spirit into the adoption of AI. These practices must be focused on collaboratively ensuring that governance-related decisions involving AI are continuously evaluated in a fashion that demystifies technological outputs and that ensures that citizens are not driven to simply “accept” algorithmic outputs out of either a lack of understanding or the absence of social structures that allow them to meaningfully contest seemingly unjust or incorrect algorithmic decisions. Moreover, people must feel that they receive some practical benefit of working within such associational models, implying that the socio-technical governance structures that are developed need to actually work for people at all levels of government and must respond to their feedback, ideas, and concerns. The results of evaluations cannot simply be meaningless reports left to rot in untouched data repositories. Importantly, research has demonstrated that there are consequential benefits both in terms of social trust and in terms of economic development for communities with high levels of civic engagement. There are thus clear advantages to achieving this collaborative ideal through AI benchmarking and to cementing benchmarking’s role in empowering new forms of civic association.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;democratic-ai-governance-lessons-from-tocqueville-and-today&quot;&gt;Democratic AI Governance: Lessons from Tocqueville and Today&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many mainstream conversations related to AI, scaling is presented as the fundamental solution to advancing the technology. In technical terms, scaling can refer to increasing model parameters, the amount of training data, or computing capabilities to achieve performance benefits. Scaling models in such a fashion takes significant financial resources, and, as a result, has contributed to the centralization of AI development in the hands of private organizations that already have the capacity to collect data, develop larger models, and afford significant computing resources. As a result of this understanding of scaling, the technical capabilities, model development, and overall direction of AI development are concentrated. This form of socio-technical relationship, and its political and economic results, presents a challenge to a more democratic vision for how AI can be integrated into governance. It is also misaligned with Tocqueville’s preference for local initiative and community leadership to address issues of public concern. More democratic-focused efforts surrounding AI will require local participation and association that can assist in generating the robust—and democratically oriented—civil society that this report’s approach highlights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSIS Futures Lab researchers are not the first to recognize this issue. Civil society organizations have already called for more distributed models of AI research and deployment. Legislative activity in the United States, such as the CREATE AI Act, is attempting to democratize access to computing resources. Moreover, a robust community of open-source AI development is highly active, illustrated by organizations such as Hugging Face, which hosts a repository of open-source models available for public use. Within open-source AI development, some level of model weights, code, and model parameters are available to the public. Proponents of an open-source approach suggest that it is far more likely to democratize access to the technology and, furthermore, is more in line with scientific practices of transparency and the evaluation of research findings. In addition, within the research community, scholars have begun to pose the question: “How can scientists co-create AI systems with local communities to address context-specific concerns?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The picture that emerges centers on a range of actors, operating within a regulatory environment that incentivizes participatory action and a democratization of access, coming together to address and experiment with solving practical governance problems that are both posed by AI and, potentially, solved through the targeted use of the same technology. Such a view is supported by modern legal theorists suggesting that a diverse set of actors with clear, vocal interests can contribute to localized policy innovation. Moreover, this methodology emphasizes the associational and civic-minded approach that scholars such as James and Deborah Fallows have revealed through their writings on the United States. Thus, experimentation on, and subsequent technical evaluation of, how AI will interact with democratic governance cannot simply be a top-down driven process but instead must pursue associational pluralism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the domains of international relations and foreign policy may seem too abstract for such an associative politics related to general AI development, and the evaluation process specifically, this does not have to be the case. Much mainstream international relations research—particularly from the 1970s and 1980s—treated states as like units, or billiard balls which interacted to either cooperate or compete. Complicating the picture, more recent work, such as that cited above on the relationship between democracy and foreign policy, as well as other research in international affairs emphasizing notions of “human security”—i.e., the desire to shift the lens of security away from states and toward the needs of individuals—has expanded the aperture for what, and who, counts when it comes to international affairs. Moreover, there exists a diverse array of actors with a stake in the field, ranging from citizen organizations, universities, think tanks, NGOs, and others. The point is that even the domain of international relations—at times called the realm of high politics—has an existing grammar and set of actors with which to discuss and experiment with the issues addressed in this paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its core, this paper advocates for a set of AI governance and model evaluation procedures that are multi-scalar, participatory, and grounded in civil society—not simply rooted in top-down regulatory regimes that, although well meaning, may fail to understand the complexity of certain local or domain-specific problems, or that are corporate controlled, and thus driven by market incentives rather than through robust civil involvement. This effort should be independent of government institutions and corporate interests and should be nonpartisan in form. The goal is to promote the maximum exchange of information by holding providers that power agentic systems accountable. Illustrating problematic tendencies or biases can pressure firms to correct and improve model performance, thereby creating a feedback system that incentivizes open information exchange. This argument is not without basis, as research on corporate social responsibility has demonstrated that, in some circumstances, firms respond to public pressures and update business practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;toward-an-associational-model-of-ai-benchmarking-governance&quot;&gt;Toward an Associational Model of AI Benchmarking Governance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing from the prior sections on the critical nature of civic associations in forming more publicly accountable, transparent, and effective practices of AI benchmarking, this section develops a model for associational practices related to AI governance, specifically focusing on AI evaluation and benchmarking. Many proposed AI governance models are broad based and offer wholistic views of the governance environment. They do so by incorporating elements or layers that are as general as categories such as society, technical factors, and ethics. Though these concepts are useful for identifying key considerations for successful AI governance, without more direct conceptualization, they are less practical in terms of generating practices in specific contexts. The broad scope of ethical AI is a good example, as scholarly reviews of the emerging AI governance literature have noted that some discussions of AI ethics struggle to identify the details of real-world implementation, possibly limiting ethical AI’s practical effectiveness. Yet, problematically, some proposed governance approaches fail to discuss ethical dimensions at all, including fairness, transparency, and trust. In fact, some reviews illustrate a general failure to broadly operationalize processes related to AI governance. Thus, focusing on tangible practices within governing structures can help to illustrate what broader categories, such as ethics, mean for practical implementation purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some researchers address the specificity of organizational governance, offering important insight as to how organizations, such as private firms, play a role in governance structures. However, due to their focus on the level of the organization, these approaches can miss the critical set of players that must be involved in successful governance beyond how individual organizations set up and implement their own AI-related standards. For example, levels of AI governance touch on a range of players (frequently referred to as stakeholders in the governance literature) as diverse as small teams within organizations, large international governing bodies, and even individuals impacted by the technology. Moreover, a diverse array of actors has been instrumental in proposing various models and principals of AI governance, including the U.S. National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) AI Risk Framework, the EU AI Act, private organization frameworks from the likes of Microsoft and Google, and civil society groups, among many others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, not only are there multiple levels in which AI governance occurs, but there are also multiple domains of practice in which AI governance must be implemented. As some have noted, governance solutions must be implemented at all stages of the AI development lifecycle, from model development to deployment. This includes factors in which benchmarking plays a role, for example, those related to testing, evaluation verification, and validation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make this discussion more practical, the following section focuses specifically on the critical area of benchmarking and its possible role in AI governance, while also acknowledging the complex array of actors involved in any truly associational model of governance. The fundamental focus here is grounding benchmarking in transparency and accountability based on domain-specific, expert-crafted data, whether the context of the evaluation process be benchmarking model reasoning capabilities on tasks such as foreign policy decisions or evaluating model performance on local community implementation of AI to assist in providing efficient services. It is through increasing transparency and accountability that U.S. citizens will be able to better decide how (and if) the technology is working to improve their lives in meaningful ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than merely suggest that critical factors such as transparency are important in AI governance, this report posits a model for implementation that puts transparency and accountability into practice, thus contributing to calls from researchers to ensure that there is a “how for every what” involved in the governance of AI and ML technologies. In other words, this report attempts to translate abstract principals into specific practices, roles, and benefits. Thus, the proposal outlined here is both micro-focused in that this model isolates one aspect of AI governance (evaluation and benchmarking) and macro-focused as it applies to a general range of domains from local community organizations to the governmental level. Simply put, it is a model that, while focused chiefly on benchmarking, can apply to many real-world use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 1 depicts this model. It starts by describing the constituent elements located at the central part of the model and then laying out their interactions—the most fundamental piece of the associational model. Three component parts contribute directly to the proposed model’s main purpose—a robust AI evaluation and benchmarking cycle—which is further described below. Table 1 summarizes the roles and functions of the various elements involved in this cycle, as well as the benefits each element receives from participation in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Civil Society.&lt;/em&gt; The first component part, as emphasized most directly in the above discussion, consists of civil society actors. With respect to a technology like AI that is largely a general-purpose technology, actors comprising this constituent part of the model are intentionally diverse. For example, civil society actors with interests in the evaluation and benchmarking of AI could range from think tanks to universities and to local community organizations concerned with mitigating adverse impacts of poor performing AI on local services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within this associational model, civil society serves three key roles. The first is through the expression of interested community actors and organized groups in shaping technological performance. Due to the likely wide impacts of AI integration (from computer vision to language models), there are obvious incentives for civil society groups to become engaged in signaling their interests regarding model performance. Groups interested in AI evaluation also provide inputs related to how civil society organizations see the technology as benefiting their specific communities, along with the worries and concerns the same groups have regarding possible technological abuse and undesirable performance. As a result of this relationship, public institutions and technology companies receive important inputs on what broader social groups want—and do not want—from AI-enabled technology. These lines of communication between civil society and government and technology developers will be fundamental to ensuring that technology firms and government are aware of how civil society organizations imagine AI integrating into their daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1SRXLe7.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Associational Benchmarking Concept&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, because civil society organizations can operate outside the incentive structures of private businesses and public institutions, they are able to provide important checks and balances by demanding transparency and accountability from other constituent parts of evaluation processes. Of course, transparency and accountability do not come from external demands alone, thus requiring important legislative enablers, but they can provide pressures for governments and private organizations to act or change behavior due to, for example, invoking reputational concerns or illustrating broad social desires for action. Additionally, civil society organizations can serve as key interlocutors for publishing evaluation metrics, writing public-facing reports on benchmarking studies, and conducting reviews of evaluation results related to real-world use cases. In basic terms, civil society can push the development and deployment of AI in a direction that serves broader social interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, as discussed above, valid benchmarking datasets and evaluation processes require coherent, domain-specific knowledge that can be updated and refined as contexts change. In many circumstances, civil society organizations can assist in providing domain-relevant expertise and knowledge that typically cannot be replicated within governing institutions and private technology providers. Moreover, the organizations can serve as key partners in generating specific metrics and operationalizations of domain-specific knowledge that can be integrated into benchmarking procedures. Without valid metrics, the construct validity of any evaluation process will be dubious. For instance, academic and scientific organizations retain a great deal of critical systematic knowledge relevant to real-world AI use cases that, absent transparent dialogue, cannot be obtained in a manner workable for designing model evaluations. The basic point is that expert-created data and evaluations will improve the quality of AI models and better demonstrate their strengths and weaknesses. To facilitate access to this data, government institutions, such as the Library of Congress, could serve as publicly accessibly data repositories for high-quality, curated, pooled data training that public organizations can access for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, as discussed in greater detail below, government must invest in broader AI literacy to improve the feedback mechanisms between civil society and other constituent parts of the model. Not all relevant civil society organizations with interest in participating in associative processes related to model benchmarking will have the specific skill set to make necessary contributions from the onset. If the U.S. public does not have a basic level of AI literacy, as well as access to resources to experiment with AI, civil society will be a less effective form of checks and balances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Technical Providers and Systems.&lt;/em&gt; The second component part comprises technical providers and systems. As with civil society addressed above, this component can be multidimensional, including, first off, the critical actor set of private technology organizations. These organizations include the major AI developers: OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, XAI, Google, and others. These private businesses are in the unique position of having the financial and compute resources, as well as the technical expertise, to build, train, and offer public-facing AI products. Here, the commonly discussed “black box” of AI- and ML-related technologies poses the highest risk, as these actors at times have incentives to restrict outsider access to algorithms, model weights, and the like. There is also generally a wide gap between technical knowledge within these organizations compared to the general public. The consequence is high levels of opacity due to technical literacy differences between communities. Moreover, these companies typically offer application programing interfaces (APIs) that allow businesses and individuals to integrate high-performing models into their own workflows, which then may be converted into consumer-facing products, making technical providers key actors in broader business (and other organization) processes in which AI is increasingly deployed. Yet technology companies are not the only actor that could qualify within this constituent part of the broader model. Open-source approaches to AI development allow for individuals and institutions to host models and to train them to their own specific purposes without access to a particular corporation’s API, thus complicating the direct roles of technology provider and system developer. The basic point is that developers of AI products must be involved in governance processes for them to be effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within evaluation processes, the role of these groups is critical as, in general, companies will likely continue to retain the highest degree of combined technical expertise in crafting model evaluations along with the related financial resources. Moreover, from an operational perspective, owing to their technical expertise, the technical providers and systems are important in offering guidance on converting local domain and institutional knowledge into a data structure on which a benchmark can be created and model performance measured. Due to the aforementioned motivations driving many private companies comprising this element of the model, the enabling legislative environment, discussed in greater detail below, must structure incentives in a fashion that drives benefits for technology providers toward open and accountable participation in the benchmarking and evaluation processes. This effort at associational benchmarking will be most effective if friction between technology providers, government, and civil society is minimized through the right legal incentive structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Public Institutions.&lt;/em&gt; The third component part of the associational model presented here is public institutions. This includes organizations ranging from federal departments that are part of the executive branch to local governments that may be interested in implementing AI tools in their own daily workflows or service provision. Although organizations can pursue their own bureaucratic political interests, the ideal function of public institutions, at least in a democratic context, is to implement policy in service of the public. What these institutions contribute in the context of this governance model is that they are likely integrating AI into service provision and thereby impacting governing practices and policy implementation in a range of domains. In fact, recent executive guidance has directed federal departments to develop institutional policies and procedures for implementing AI. The involvement of public institutions is unlikely to decrease. As such, these institutions will serve as a major touchpoint between the public and AI’s real-world use cases in circumstances ranging from obtaining government benefits to courts making decisions on the likelihood of recidivism. Moreover, such institutions retain significant public data on which institutional models are likely to be trained (and privacy concerns made acute) as well as specific expertise related to the institution’s particular purview (for example, the Environmental Protection Agency on environmental issues or the National Institutes of Health on issues related to public health). As such, they will be critical in developing relevant benchmarks and metrics associated with public service performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, public institutions, such as NIST, are critical in creating regulatory and standard-setting apparatuses in many scientific and technical contexts from which private organizations will derive their own institutional policies. In this space, CAISI (previously the U.S. AISI), as part of NIST, will play a key role as it operates as a standards-setting body and works with industry members to set voluntary commitments on model evaluation and security. CAISI has already been an active participant in model evaluations. For example, in late 2024, alongside the UK AI Safety Institute, CAISI conducted a pre-deployment evaluation of Open AI’s o1 model, focusing specifically on cyber, biological, and software and AI development. Moreover, in early 2025, CAISI released a technical report related to initial evaluation results on how AI agents risk being subject to “high jacking,” in which malicious actors inject unwanted instructions into AI agent workflows. NIST and CAISA must continue to play a meaningful part within this benchmarking governance model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, in terms of the associational evaluation model presented here, public institutions play a fundamental role. First, they are key targets of transparency and accountability feedback loops that are driven by civil society and civic association. If effective AI governance is to be implemented, it is up to such institutions to act on and respond to benchmarking results in meaningful ways by updating training data, workflows, and other relevant practices in response to feedback. Second, such organizations are likely to act as key data brokers in their specific domains as they work with private companies to train and deploy models on institutional use cases. In simple terms, without the commitment of public institutions, effective implementation and governance of AI agents will remain out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/f4VazX4.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: Summary of Model Elements&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Evaluation cycle.&lt;/em&gt; The three constituent parts discussed above are linked within the associational evaluation cycle, with each element providing feedback and incentives to the other component parts. Links between these component parts are representative of both communication and accountability. Responsiveness to impacted communities is fundamental to this associational model. This section will briefly outline this recursive relationship along three parameters: (1) benchmark creation; (2) implementation, analysis, and dissemination of results; and (3) real-world responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, benchmark creation requires critical inputs from all constituent parts of the evaluation cycle. Civil society groups, for example, can be instrumental in expressing local interests, and, in certain circumstances (particularly in the case of think tanks or universities where specified knowledge is available), creating scenario-specific data on which to evaluate model performance. Thus, along this parameter, information flows to both technical providers and public institutions (as indicated by the arrows in Figure 1). Civil society groups transfer information in the forms of expressing a civil association’s specific interest when it comes to model performance, assisting in generating data for a benchmark, and providing input on which metrics account for a fair and realistic measure of performance on the relevant task. For benchmark creation, technical providers and systems offer important technical knowledge on how to design benchmarks valid for domain-specific data structures that they can share with partners in civil society and public institutions. Moreover, they can provide feedback on how technological progress in AI, largely driven by private firms, may shape requirements for updating relevant benchmarking practices. Finally, public institutions will be key in both listening to and engaging with relevant civic groups interested in involvement in benchmarking. Moreover, due to domain expertise and data access, public institutions will be crucial in generating contextual knowledge to include in benchmarking and, working recursively with interested civil society groups, in developing relevant metrics on which to assess evaluation results. Proper metrics thus will be the outcome of deliberative processes between stakeholders and based on domain-specific knowledge. Importantly, without the participation of multiple stakeholders in benchmarking, the results of benchmarking studies may lack real-world applicability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, with respect to implementation, analysis, and information dissemination, civil society interacts with the other constituent parts largely in terms of interpreting benchmarking results according to their own local or domain-specific knowledge, as well as by acting as a key driver of transparency and accountability. Within the context of associational benchmarking, civil society organizations should participate in public advocacy and serve as essential providers of data and metrics to the public, particularly through creating and disseminating accessible information relevant to both their own association members and to the broader interested public. Moreover, because civil society operates outside of the for-profit incentives of private corporations and the bureaucratic pressures of public institutions, civil society organizations (particularly universities and think tanks) can offer objective analyses of evaluation results and their implications. During implementation and analysis, technology providers and systems typically should offer compute, model hosting, and other related technical skills to make evaluation processes methodologically consistent and relevant for the most advanced AI technologies (whether in computer vision, natural language processing, or others). Finally, public institutions within this parameter should focus on analyzing results specific to institutional goals based on agreed upon metrics. Along these lines, they should provide access to information to civil society organizations on evaluation results to ensure transparency and accountability to public interests. As with benchmark creation, meaningful participation of all stakeholders is crucial. This means matching local expertise with technical experience in interpreting benchmarking results and government actors maintaining awareness of how results link to their institutional goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, as emphasized above, benchmarks should not be seen as simple technical resources, but rather as a set of socio-technical relations. As such, linking evaluation results to real-world processes of responsiveness by updating social and institutional practices as well as data resources is fundamental to this associational model functioning outside of theoretical terms. Thus, civil society actors must provide indicators to technical systems and providers, as well as public institutions, regarding how downstream AI applications are shaping their specific interests. In addition, such groups must be prepared to apply pressure to public institutions and technical providers who may fail to commit to transparent practices and who lack accountability. When applicable, technology providers and systems must be prepared to share how their models perform on benchmarks relevant to a broad range of civic actors. In the long run, the technology providers and systems will benefit from group feedback on how their products perform in a range of contexts, thereby allowing them to make product improvements and increase user trust. Lastly, public institutions need to be responsive to updating and curating relevant institutional data while also retaining enough institutional and technical flexibility to adapt practices according to the results of evaluation. This is critical, as maintaining a stagnant approach within the highly fluid context of governance will likely lead to undesirable technological performance, and thereby worse public services. Notably, it is perfectly possible that evaluation results may demonstrate technological limitations, thus illustrating that certain use cases are not appropriate, or remain too high risk, for AI integration into institutional practices at this stage. Even with all the technical best practices imaginable, if evaluation results do not result in required change, AI will likely fail to have a positive impact on broader society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the constituent elements of the central evaluation cycle, two constraining and enabling conditions feature in the model: the domain and the legislative environment. While each will vary based on the context in which benchmarking is needed, both will necessarily exist in some form. Moreover, both generate the type of data that will be needed for evaluation purposes and for the incentive structure under which key actors operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Domain.&lt;/em&gt; All benchmarking and evaluation processes, particularly those in contexts relevant to governing, must be shaped by domain-specific considerations. These specific considerations should orient and guide the entire benchmarking and evaluation cycle discussed above, including the technical processes of implementing evaluations; different use cases will require unique considerations as well. Moreover, the domain will influence what sort of organizations (e.g., environmental, legal, and human rights organizations) participate in the evaluation processes of AI technologies. Data curation and subsequent model evaluation should include a range of domain-specific experts, depending on the desired AI use case. In addition, this should involve leveraging civil society associations, among other possible pools of experts, in the entire evaluation lifecycle. Ignoring this critical element risks evaluation results not properly corresponding to the real-world contexts in which the technology may be used, thus seriously threatening a benchmark’s construct validity, or put simply, its applicability to the real world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Legislative Environment.&lt;/em&gt; All elements of the model are embedded within the legislative environment and, therefore, this environment must serve as an enabler of the associative model proposed here. While legislation and regulation are unlikely to solve all governance issues related to AI, they can create incentive structures that give value for participation to a broad range of stakeholders. Moreover, legislation can enable civic groups to have a real impact on model benchmarking and, thus, on how models are deployed. This includes supporting efforts aimed at increasing AI literacy among civil associations in local government contexts in order to ensure more robust and effective benchmarking processes and creating funding pools to enable expert civil society organizations to commit labor and other resources to creating robust evaluation cycles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, a truly enabling legislative environment must manage power differentials between organizations that may be involved in benchmarking processes. Technological development and deployment take place within large social power structures, and the gap between the financial resources of exsisting AI companies and, for instance, locally oriented civil society groups will be vast. Thus, it is important to create an environment in which civil associations, the heart of this model of governance, do not get steamrolled by more powerful interests, compromising the validity of evaluative processes and their benefits. Within this model, truly robust benchmarking can only take place if civil organizations’ concerns are heard and acted upon rather than ignored in favor of more powerful corporate or political interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final element of the model centers on the components that emphasize the process outputs and the requirements of updating inputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Process outputs.&lt;/em&gt; The evaluation cycle, per the stated goals of transparency and accountability, will result in multiple outputs, including publicly available metrics and reports that indicate model performance on domain-specific tasks. However, process outputs must also lead to iterative updating of institutional practices that align AI workflows and use cases with evaluation results. Moreover, new technical methodologies in domain-specific evaluation are likely to emerge through this process, and civil society organizations will gain insight into how AI impacts their direct interests, along with increasing their organizational knowledge about evaluation and benchmarking as a practice. That said, as discussed below, leaving these outputs stagnant sets up the broader process for failure; as such, recursive updating of process inputs is key. The data and metrics that result from evaluation studies must be leveraged to inform future AI development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updating Inputs.&lt;/em&gt; At its heart, the model presented here emphasizes associational politics, deliberative processes, and experimentalism. Each aspect has roots in the literatures of democratic political theory, philosophy, and experimental governance. As such, this model includes the essential function of updating inputs recursively, underscoring the need for constant analysis and iterative learning through reaction to prior operations and deliberation between constituent components of the evaluation cycles. Moreover, this model emphasizes experimentation in that it calls for “ongoing, reciprocal readjustments of ends and means.” Actors must reflexively learn and scrutinize their own actions and interests in pursuing the collective goal. This model builds these requirements as new inputs as the process cycles through continuous iteration. Without adapting to new information, actors risk deploying technology to use cases it is not built for, resulting in undesirable consequences for everyday users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, each component part of the model described above must work in conjunction with the others to achieve the desired outcome of responsive, domain-specific, benchmarking efforts. By including the proper legislative incentive structures and tangible benefits, each actor within the model can be incorporated into a cycle of positive feedback loops that can sustain the model’s relevance and success. The following section will identify three recommendations that could serve as enablers to implementing this model in real-world contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;policy-implications-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Policy Implications and Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth linking the above discussion to ongoing developments in U.S. AI policy. As addressed in more detail above, recent guidance from the Trump administration has rearticulated much of the work done by the Biden administration in establishing national AI policy. In doing so, the Trump administration, particularly in terms of rhetoric, has preferred a more innovation-forward approach to implementing AI across the U.S. government. This is seen in a range of policy guidance from the administration, including the aforementioned executive order entitled “Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence” as well as guidance from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in the form of “Accelerating Federal Use of AI through Innovation, Governance, and Public Trust” and “Driving Efficient Acquisition of Artificial Intelligence in Government.” While innovation and adoption of AI throughout the U.S. government may be a priority of the Trump administration, the current approach risks failure without reliable and iterative evaluation practices that emphasize input from civil actors. Voices from the bottom-up need to be key drivers of technology implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be fair, the above-mentioned federal guidance appears to be amenable to many of the items proposed in the associational evaluation model of this report. For example, the OMB’s memorandum on “Accelerating Federal Use of AI through Innovation, Governance, and Public Trust” notes the importance of protecting civil rights and liberties and developing responsible AI, and it calls out the critical nature of transparency, governance, and public trust. Moreover, it identifies the need for continuous monitoring of AI systems, particularly in high-impact use cases, along with supporting broader AI literacy among agency employees. Finally, in line with aspects drawn out in the model discussed here, this OMB memo highlights the importance of numerous and diverse stakeholders, including private actors and external experts in AI, along with the need for the independent review of AI systems, particularly in high-impact use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few issues within the OMB guidance worth further assessment, as well as discussion regarding how the model proposed here can support and improve recent policy guidance. For example, independent reviews within the OMB document are stated to be conducted by a reviewer “within the agency” who has not been a part of system development. While this is certainly an important step, within-agency review may not sufficiently isolate the reviewer from political and bureaucratic pressures. As such, incorporating civil society organizations into the process of model assessment and evaluation can add an additional layer of separation between bureaucratic political pressures and AI evaluation, thereby contributing to more objective and transparent analyses of benchmarking results. Additionally, while innovation is key, emphasizing this factor to too great a degree may undermine other components of federal guidance, including developing and implementing AI responsibly, improving public trust, and avoiding harm to U.S. citizens. Depending on the domain, incorporating a range of civil society actors into the evaluation cycle and integrating robust and transparent feedback mechanisms could facilitate a pragmatic balance between technological innovation and building systems that work as intended within specific contexts. Importantly, increasing trust and accountability within AI governance will lead to more robust and sustainable development of AI-associated technologies. Finally, while sensible in general terms, proposed efforts at improving efficiency and reusing elements of AI development through agency coordination could lead to issues in downstream technology deployment. Unrestrained efforts at improving implementation efficiency and the reuse of technical systems could lead to circumstances in which systems and data designed for one context are applied to a different, non-applicable case, increasing the risk that the system will not perform as desired due to contextual variation. This is why continuous benchmarking on domain-specific tasks, including constant iteration and feedback loops, is key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This discussion leads to three substantive recommendations (summarized in Table 2 below). &lt;strong&gt;First, legislators at the federal and state levels should pursue legislation that encourages and enables civil society actors to become involved in independent benchmarking efforts, while working with private technology providers and public institutions.&lt;/strong&gt; This could include offering funding resources for think tanks, universities, and even local community organizations to become meaningful stakeholders in the process of benchmarking and evaluation. This could also incorporate increasing resources for upscaling broader AI literacy in existing civil society organizations and encouraging these organizations to position themselves as key stakeholders within conversations on AI governance, benchmarking, and evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Congress should begin to explore which congressional committees have the authority to hold routine hearings on model benchmarking and evaluation to ensure that iterative, inclusive, and robust processes remain in play across private and public sector contexts. Currently, a range of committees have at least some form of jurisdiction related to AI policy development, including committees as diverse as the Judiciary Committee in the Senate and the Foreign Affairs Committee in the House, reflecting the wide impact AI will have on questions of governance. Congressional committees with interests in AI should begin the process of holding benchmarking-related hearings to hold AI firms and federal agencies accountable, while also looking to the best interests of the people they are elected to represent. Within such a process, civil society organizations can leverage their traditional advocacy roles to make local interests heard by congressional representatives, as well as offer expert testimony on the evaluation results and technological impact they observe in their local contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second, legislative bodies at all levels of government should pursue creating meaningful incentives for AI firms and public institutions to coordinate their benchmarking efforts with civic society organizations.&lt;/strong&gt; This can help to match civil society organizations’ domain expertise, local concerns, and user feedback with any deployed AI agent. Incentives could include formal legislation requiring AI companies to operate in specific ways or incentives which hope to shape corporate behavior without specific standards. Legislators could even use state or federal tax law in order to manage AI firms’ incentives. Historically, these tools have been used successfully in other contexts, such as influencing corporate hiring practices. Of course, such a strategy would forgo tax revenue from some of the United States’ largest companies, requiring a careful legislative strategy that balances desired corporate behavior with necessary tax revenue. Moreover, legislation should encourage open, transparent, and accountable evaluation practices, and could even establish standard practices for benchmark reporting. Similar reporting incentives have been used with regard to corporate disclosures of supply chains and labor abuses, although their effectiveness remains a point of a debate. Private firms have already offered a variety of pledges toward building more robust and safe AI systems, for example, in the form of creating nonprofit industry groups and voluntary commitments to shared safety practices in model development and deployment. Additionally, legislation could encourage these private organizations to pursue additional commitments aimed at integrating civil society actors—as well as committing to greater degrees of transparency—within the evaluation processes in line with the general model of associational benchmarking proposed here. A key consideration in legislative processes needs to be harmonizing local, state, and federal AI policies into a functioning mosaic of governance. Excessive fragmentation of AI policy could lead to difficulties as organizations attempt to navigate different rules for model evaluation and deployment in different localities. Efforts to disincentivize state-level regulations on AI look to address this issue; however, these efforts challenge core components of the U.S. federalist system. Moreover, lawmakers will need to balance the need for oversight with the desire for further innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third, and perhaps most critically, the United States’ philanthropic foundations can play a fundamental role in coordinating the funding of multiple major cross-disciplinary benchmarking initiatives to enhance and preserve the independence of a modern form of accountable, associational model evaluation.&lt;/strong&gt; Without independent financial support, there is a risk that evaluation processes will be co-opted by narrow interests, thus turning a potentially productive tool of measuring the technologies’ performances into something far more superficial. In fact, recent research has demonstrated that some model leaderboards related to popular AI benchmarks can be gamed by large private companies, which are incentivized to present their products as the best-performing models. Involving independent actors with interests in the public good and not financial profit, and providing them with the resources to meaningfully participate, could help to mitigate such problems and make evaluation practices more robust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is important to recognize that foundations, and their philanthropic contributions, have a more complex history than can be explored here, there is a clear precedent for their inclusion in this process. Researchers studying foundations suggest that philanthropic contributions commonly focus on the creation of “something new,” whether that be related to social arrangements, the arts, or science. Moreover, foundations can serve as social entrepreneurs that “respond to needs or problems that are beyond the reach” of current market incentives or government capacity. While the grant-making capabilities of foundations are key, particularly in the specific contexts of supporting research initiatives, these organizations also have the ability to leverage social mechanisms that legitimate new forms of organization and that develop professionals to support that same organizational infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foundations also play a key role in supporting civil society actors, such as NGOs. For example, the MacArthur Foundation and the Mott Foundation both provide grants to various NGOs working in the United States and globally. The grants range from support for organizations working on managing global crises to those addressing climate change. Historically, foundations have enabled key research in the social and hard sciences. The Rockefeller Foundation played a key role in the establishment of biomedical research and molecular biology. Grants by the MacArthur Foundation helped to build up a range of research institutions working on managing risks from nuclear weapons, such as Stanford’s Center for International Security and Cooperation and Harvard’s Belfer Center. The Russell Sage Foundation has focused on supporting social science researchers and contributed to the development of “social indicators” to help inform data-driven social policy. The editors of a foundation-supported volume asserted that such indicators are “imperative for the guidance of social policy.” As a final example, the Gates Foundation is a critical cog in foundation-based global health and development initiatives. Foundations thus support a wide range of pursuits in the social and hard sciences across a range of domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critical for this discussion is that the broader fields of computer science and artificial intelligence also have roots in foundation support. As a significant example, the Macy Foundation contributed to a series of conferences beginning in the 1940s that set the stage for the development of the field of “cybernetics.” While the field is far reaching in scope, impacting disciplines as diverse as neuroscience and various social sciences, cybernetics was highly influential in early research into computing and AI. Its influence largely lies in the introduction of concepts such as feedback mechanisms, control theory, and complex systems. In basic terms, cybernetics focuses on how feedback loops shape behavioral patterns in both human and machine systems. Key attendees of the Macy conferences included Norbert Wiener, generally considered the father of cybernetics; John von Neumann, the creator of the Von Neumann architecture, which remains an influential paradigm in modern computer design; and Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts, key figures in the development of the initial model of the neural network. Foundation support can be said to have helped create the conditions for today’s advances in AI and computing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foundation grants in the domain of AI continue to be influential across a diverse spectrum of viewpoints. Philanthropic organizations, such as Open Philanthropy and the Future of Life Institute, provide grants for AI-related research, particularly focusing on managing “existential risks.” Moreover, established foundations such as the Ford and MacArthur Foundations have funded AI-related organizations, including the AI Now Institute, which focuses on issues of AI-related surveillance and power consolidation in the hands of technology companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The history and current funding profile of U.S. foundations have clear relevance for the CSIS Futures Lab’s proposed associational model of AI evaluation and benchmarking. While the foundation approach to funding is not perfect, it does play a critical role in how research organizations and civil society groups gain support for their initiatives. For example, foundation contributions could encourage the emergence of new civil society organizations oriented toward transparent benchmarking practices across a range of domains. This type of foundation support could fill in the gaps where market or government incentives for such funding may be limited. Moreover, foundation-based funding efforts could assist in creating new research fellowship streams that are focused directly on bringing domain-specific experts into benchmarking processes, whether these be individuals from small local organizations focused on community issues or experienced researchers with specific disciplinary skills and knowledge. However, effective relationships will need to result in long-term funding commitments to avoid funding gaps and to reduce the risk that funding organizations rapidly change priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recommendations outlined above seek to create a policy environment that enables AI firms and civil society groups to work together in a productive fashion to produce more robust and dynamic benchmarking outputs. Such cooperation will improve the likelihood that AI works for broader segments of society on tasks that require specific expertise and knowledge. Moreover, it suggests that U.S. foundations can play a crucial part in establishing civil society groups that have the talent and resources to participate in this associational model of AI benchmarking and evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 2: Policy Recommendations Summary&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the near term, AI agents will not simply function as a tool but will shape (and to a degree already are shaping) how decisions are made and who gets to make them. Whether it be in the context of national security and foreign policy decisions or related to getting access to government benefits, decisions shaped by AI systems are set to influence people’s life outcomes. To avoid a scenario in which society relinquishes a detrimental amount of agency to opaque AI systems, thereby challenging democratic principles of governance, a renewed form of associative action is required. This form of association must bring many stakeholders to the table—including policymakers, researchers, civic leaders, and interested members of impacted communities—to generate robust, dynamic, and responsive benchmarking practices. Critically, this process must be transparent and open. As others have argued, “transparency is an essential precondition for public accountability, scientific innovation, and effective governance of digital technologies. Without adequate transparency, stakeholders cannot understand foundation models, who they affect, and the impact they have on society.” Moreover, researchers have suggested that transparency can be fundamental for “reducing the mystique and opaqueness of AI to the general public.” While research has shown that transparency is not a direct cause of accountability, it is a necessary condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In line with this goal and drawing from the work of Tocqueville, scholarship in deliberative democracy, and experimentalist approaches to governance, this analysis has presented an associational model of benchmarking to assist in visualizing our broader argument. Moreover, this report has offered a variety of recommendations related to government and foundation policy that could assist in enabling this vision to become a reality. Fundamentally, in an open and democratic society, it is not enough to build powerful and capable models—we must also build the civic institutions and practices capable of questioning them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Lithuania engages with the evolving EU Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulatory architecture, a recent workshop in Vilnius, co-hosted by Lithuania’s Center of Excellence in Anti-Money Laundering (AML Center) and the Centre for Finance and Security at RUSI, provided a forum for diverse financial and regulatory stakeholders to reflect on national readiness, implementation challenges and regulatory clarity. Discussions centred on institutional coordination, regulatory feedback mechanisms, supervisory expectations, sector-specific implications and the anticipated role of the Anti-Money Laundering Authority (AMLA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, the workshop sought to build understanding of how a major new AML framework (described below), designed in Brussels in light of significant AML policy failings in the traditional banking sector – most notably in the Nordic-Baltic region a decade ago – is viewed in a diverse financial community such as Lithuania, and the extent of the understanding and implementation gap that exists between Brussels and EU member states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion took place against the backdrop of the ongoing cross-European efforts to implement the legislative package adopted by the European Commission in May 2024 (the EU AML Package). This comprehensive framework comprises several key pillars:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The AML Regulation (AMLR), which introduces a single rulebook for AML/CFT (countering the financing of terrorism), establishing uniform rules that are directly applicable across all member states.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Sixth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD6), which addresses the structural aspects of AML supervision and enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regulation (EU) 2024/1620, which established the AMLA, mandated with direct supervisory and coordination responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The transfer of funds regulation (TFR), which extends the so-called “travel rule” to all financial transactions, irrespective of the amount. Under the revised TFR, the travel rule is now applicable to not only traditional financial institutions but also crypto-asset service providers (CASPs).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most notable changes observed by workshop attendees is the expanded scope of obliged entities. New sectors such as crowdfunding platforms, investment migration operators, mortgage credit intermediaries, non-financial holding companies and football clubs/agents will fall under the regulation. This broadening of scope will have limited relevance in Lithuania, but it will affect Lithuania’s vibrant fintech community, nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The country hosts an innovative and expanding fintech ecosystem, facilitated by a streamlined licensing process that has attracted over 260 fintech firms, positioning Vilnius as a regional fintech hub. Key financial players in the country include both domestic and international banks such as SEB, Swedbank and Luminor, as well as a growing number of electronic money institutions (EMIs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop, workshop participants characterised private sector engagement on the EU AML Package as an area of mixed progress. Some participants noted proactive steps by larger institutions to familiarise themselves with the EU AML Package – particularly the more detailed technical standards – and conduct gap analyses. However, others (particularly smaller entities) reported uncertainty regarding how and when their input is expected, raising concerns about uneven representation in shaping the implementation process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop discussion focused on a number of key issues facing the financial sector as it confronts the reality of the EU AML Package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-institutional-collaboration-and-feedback-to-the-european-banking-authority-eba&quot;&gt;1. Institutional Collaboration and Feedback to the European Banking Authority (EBA)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representatives from the Bank of Lithuania (BoL) noted their close and continuous engagement with the EBA, highlighting participation in relevant EBA committees alongside the Ministry of Finance. The EBA is an EU regulatory agency that works to ensure effective and consistent supervision of the banking sector across all member states. As a part of its mandate, it has been proactive in supporting the rollout of the EU AML Package across the bloc in relation to financial institutions. However, one participant noted that the supervision of and collaboration with non-financial institutions that are heavily impacted by the package is beyond the EBA’s mandate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to BoL representatives, the Bank’s engagement involved multiple interactions with the EBA regarding the EU AML Package, particularly as it relates to the development and dissemination of Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS). With four key RTS documents now published for comment by the EBA, the BoL has proactively communicated with the Lithuanian market to solicit feedback, with special attention to customer due diligence (CDD). Authorities present at the workshop stressed the importance of market-level feedback to the EBA, noting that input from private sector actors complements the supervisory perspective and can shape regulatory adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance of collective, market-driven feedback was also stressed by the representative of the National Development Bank of Lithuania. The BoL had requested feedback from the National Development Bank, particularly to provide commentary on the AMLD6. In response, the National Development Bank engaged with industry associations to collect inputs from across the board – in the hope that collective responses offer greater leverage, while unilateral action may reduce the ability to influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-sectoral-readiness-and-technical-adaptation&quot;&gt;2. Sectoral Readiness and Technical Adaptation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workshop participants expressed strong and divergent views on their ability to prepare for the reality of the EU AML Package. A representative of one of the biggest banks in Lithuania reported a recent assessment of the technical developments required to meet the demands of the new package. This assessment included multiple workshops and detailed workstreams, highlighting the considerable burden the industry will face. From a Baltic perspective, several significant gaps were identified by the representative which will need to be closed in order to comply with the demands of the EU AML Package. While the changes are not viewed as transformative, they will demand extensive system and procedural adjustments. Compliance and monitoring functions will face an increased workload.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expansion of regulated entities under the new rules was also raised by workshop participants. A broader array of clients will now qualify as obligated entities, imposing additional compliance responsibilities on the banks, too. Institutions are actively analysing scenarios to prepare pre-emptively. During the workshop, it was noted that over 60 new legislative instruments are under development. While not all are directly relevant to market actors, many pertain to AML oversight. Participants said that while some instruments arise from EU-level harmonisation efforts, others are linked to initiatives by the AMLA or the EBA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representatives from fintech associations and legal consultancies strongly emphasised that, for smaller entities, the primary challenge does not lie with the Level 1 legislation of the EU AML Package – that is, the core legal instruments such as regulations and directives adopted by the European Parliament and the Council. These foundational texts establish the general principles and objectives of the AML framework and have largely been understood and incorporated by the market. The greater concern arises from the Level 2 legislation, which consists of more technical and detailed rules – particularly RTS and Implementing Technical Standards – adopted by the European Commission based on proposals from supervisory authorities. These secondary measures are intended to operationalise and provide guidance on how to comply with the Level 1 framework. However, representatives of the fintech sector stakeholders noted that these provisions often extend or clarify obligations in a way that adds complexity, especially in critical compliance areas such as CDD and transaction reporting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a growing concern among participants that Level 2 technical implementation measures, by becoming overly prescriptive, will undermine the risk-based approach – a core principle of EU AML policy – by imposing uniform obligations that may not adequately account for the size, risk profile or capacity of smaller market participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, one representative of the fintech sector noted that while the AMLR seeks to establish a harmonised regulatory environment, its real-world impact may diverge significantly from this objective – particularly for digitally-native financial service providers operating across borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The representative underlined, for instance, that article 22(6) of the regulation, which restricts remote customer identification to methods that satisfy the electronic identification and trust services regulation’s assurance levels of “substantial” or “high”, effectively precludes the use of biometric technologies such as facial recognition. The problem, as noted by the representative, is that these are currently deployed by many fintech firms – not only in Lithuania – to ensure secure and efficient cross-border onboarding. Traditional banks, which typically operate within national boundaries, don’t face this challenge and therefore may encounter fewer operational disruptions when aligning to the new legislation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The speaker emphasised that this regulatory constraint presents a significant structural challenge. They said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What everyone should start thinking about now is: “What tools could possibly comply with those requirements? Are there even such tools in the market that meet this criterion and can verify all EU citizens? And how much will ID verification services cost under this regulation?”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, there was a strong view around the table that the EU AML Package was designed with big banks in mind. Describing the package as being rooted in the failings of big banks a decade ago, participants argued that it had overlooked the needs and implementation challenges of the fintech community – one of the key pillars of the Lithuanian financial services industry and overall economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-risk-based-vs-rule-based-approaches-and-innovation-constraints&quot;&gt;3. Risk-Based vs. Rule-Based Approaches and Innovation Constraints&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants expressed concern that the EU AML Package represents a shift away from a risk-based approach towards a more rules-based regime which may stifle innovation, particularly in remote onboarding processes. They noted that the Level 1 regulation encourages a risk-based approach, but Level 2 provisions appear to go further by prescribing detailed operational procedures, thereby restricting flexibility. For example, new requirements to collect place of birth – including the city rather than only the country – raise practical challenges. Whether or not the collection of birth certificates is required for this is still uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The regulatory burden is anticipated by participants to disproportionately affect the fintech sector and smaller institutions. Larger banks have had time to adapt, whereas newer market entrants often lack resources to effectively participate in consultations or anticipate regulatory shifts. Some warned that the cumulative effect may create a reinforcing loop, whereby only large institutions are adequately represented, skewing regulatory outcomes in their favour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To respond to this threat, Lithuanian fintech stakeholders are actively contributing to the consultation process led by the EBA. However, these financial stakeholders noted a lack of fintech industry representation at the EU level. A representative of the fintech sector stressed the importance of ensuring that fintech-specific operational realities are reflected in the final regulatory instruments. “The question remains whether a uniform, rules-based approach can adequately accommodate the diversity of financial service models across the EU”, the speaker concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4-supervisory-coordination-and-beneficial-ownership&quot;&gt;4. Supervisory Coordination and Beneficial Ownership&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants elaborated on the AMLR’s requirement for firms to verify beneficial ownership (BO) information when an individual holds more than 25% ownership or exercises control exceeding 50%, and to report any discrepancies within 14 days. EU member states must also revise their laws in line with the 2022 Court of Justice of the EU ruling, which found that unrestricted public access to BO registers breaches privacy rights under the EU Charter. The Court held that only those with a “legitimate interest” — such as journalists, civil society groups, and certain financial institutions — may access BO data. Member states must therefore clearly define this interest and ensure access is granted with proper safeguards. Together, these requirements significantly shape the regulatory landscape. Participants representing financial institutions pointed out that the inconsistent application of those rules across the EU harms cross-border information sharing. For example, participants reported difficulties retrieving information from registers in Scandinavian countries, citing national differences in access protocols. There was consensus among participants that such disparities necessitate harmonisation, although the implementation of AMLD6 at the national level may limit the effectiveness of EU-wide alignment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BO registers in Lithuania have access restricted to public institutions, law enforcement, obliged entities and journalists. The new rules on BO introduced in the EU AML Package prompted the BoL to conduct a gap analysis. Assessing deficiencies in the functioning of BO registries to improve their utility and relevance is regarded globally as a cornerstone of effective AML efforts, so the proactive approach taken by the BoL speaks to Lithuanian commitment to strengthening the integrity of its financial system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supervisory coordination in Lithuania is currently ad hoc, according to financial stakeholders present at the workshop. The Lithuanian Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) leads AML coordination in the country and represents Lithuania at MONEYVAL (Committee of Experts on the Evaluation of Anti-Money Laundering Measures and the Financing of Terrorism), but there is a recognised need for a more institutionalised approach. A proposal has been submitted to the government to formalise cooperation of all Lithuanian supervisors. Financial stakeholders also suggested establishing a dedicated coordination group, beyond existing ad hoc forums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;5-crypto-gambling-and-emerging-sectors&quot;&gt;5. Crypto, Gambling and Emerging Sectors&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representatives from the cryptocurrency sector highlighted their complex regulatory positioning within the evolving EU framework. While some may not fall under the definition of CASPs as defined in the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) – if, for example, they do not provide specific services such as custody, trading platforms or exchange services – they may still be subject to AML obligations under the EU AML Package. This is because the new AML obligations apply to a broader range of entities involved in the exchange, transfer, safekeeping or issuance of crypto-assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sector representatives noted that many of these entities based in Lithuania, especially those facilitating merchant payments through crypto-wallets, may operate outside traditional financial service classifications. However, they often still require registration or licensing according to national legislation, even if they are not fully captured under MiCA’s scope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One participant noted that Lithuania is not expanding its licensing framework; rather, it is narrowing the criteria for obtaining licenses. For example, the BoL continues to discourage entities from combining cryptocurrency and payment services under a single licence. According to the same participant, representatives from crypto-native companies operating in a manner similar to payment service providers believe that they do not fully fall under the current regulatory regime. This reflects an ongoing, informal debate in Lithuania regarding the range of permissible services and corresponding obligations. The BoL was described by participants as a particularly strict regulator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another participant, representing a Lithuanian gambling supervision authority, highlighted ongoing efforts to educate regulated markets. New EU legislation will impose significant changes in how they operate. For example, a representative of this sector noted that, know your customer processes, particularly around data collection such as place of birth, pose operational difficulties. The sector is also examining best practices internationally, particularly in Latvia and Estonia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;6-amla-supervision-and-future-prospects&quot;&gt;6. AMLA Supervision and Future Prospects&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to participants, the newly established AMLA, created under Regulation (EU) 2024/1620, represents a cornerstone of the EU’s updated AML framework. AMLA will serve as the central supervisory body tasked with ensuring consistent implementation of AML/CFT rules across member states. It is empowered to directly supervise selected obliged entities, coordinate cross-border enforcement efforts, and intervene where national supervision is insufficient, thereby aiming to reduce fragmentation and reinforce the credibility of the EU’s AML regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants in the Vilnius workshop noted that Lithuania will have a direct presence within AMLA’s leadership, with Simonas Krepšta, until recently a board member of the BoL, joining the authority’s executive board. Krepšta has overseen financial market supervision and digital development and has been instrumental in promoting Lithuania’s fintech ecosystem. His expertise in digital finance and supervisory oversight is expected by participants to contribute significantly to AMLA’s mandate, particularly in fostering innovation-compatible compliance strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stakeholders reflected on the dual implications of AMLA supervision. While the aim of harmonisation is broadly supported, questions remain about how dual supervision by AMLA and national regulators will function. Stakeholders anticipate that at least one Lithuanian bank may fall under AMLA’s direct supervision. Questions persist regarding the interplay with MONEYVAL assessments and the supervisory burden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative of the BoL noted that initial expectations of reduced supervisory intensity under AMLA have shifted, with increased resource deployment now anticipated. While the goal of greater consistency is welcome, it was observed that practical differences between member states remain stark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;7-information-sharing-and-technological-solutions&quot;&gt;7. Information Sharing and Technological Solutions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the workshop, some participants argued that regulation should be outcome-focused and technology-agnostic. The extent to which the EU AML Package will encourage IT adoption remains uncertain, but article 75 of the AMLR incentivises the development of such tools. It calls on member states to promote the development and use of secure, privacy-compliant digital tools supporting information sharing, typology development and automated suspicious transaction detection. While AMLD6 sets out this ambition, effective implementation will depend on national legislative frameworks and institutional readiness to operationalise these tools. In this context, the participants noted that the gap between national legislative frameworks and EU mandates remains a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since summer 2024, Lithuania has had a legal basis for private-to-private information sharing. The country has initiated a process aimed at enhancing the ability of financial institutions to share information regarding suspicious financial activities. At the beginning of April 2024, the Lithuanian Parliament approved amendments to Lithuania’s money laundering and terrorist financing prevention law. Article 15 (1) of the revised legislation stipulates that financial institutions are permitted to exchange information concerning their clients. Participants stated that the introduction of this framework marks a significant step in strengthening the country’s AML efforts, promoting greater collaboration among financial institutions, and aligning with EU-wide initiatives, including the EU AML Package. The AML Center is developing IT solutions to enable this exchange, though the complexity and the number of stakeholders involved makes implementation challenging. A representative of the AML Center, which supports the development of a strong public-private partnership in the country, explained that the system includes two core components: first, entities may request information when there is a suspicion; and second, a pre-defined criteria list from the FIU guides suspicion thresholds.

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Vilnius workshop revealed a high degree of engagement from Lithuanian authorities and financial institutions with the EU AML Package, while also highlighting areas of concern and ambiguity. The implementation of secondary legislation, the evolving role of AMLA, and the tension between harmonisation and national flexibility are critical issues for Lithuania. The workshop indicated that ensuring the inclusion of smaller actors, preserving innovation and enhancing cross-border cooperation on BO will be essential to the success of the EU AML framework in Lithuania and across the EU. There was a clear sense that the EU AML Package is, while well-intentioned, (as one participant put it) “the right idea at the wrong time” and out of step with the “deregulation zeitgeist”, and risks stifling innovation at a time when Europe should be seeking ways of accelerating, not restricting, development.&lt;/p&gt;

A European containment strategy reworked for the present particularities can help Europe unify around a common approach to Russia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the United States appearing to move away from its traditional lead role in deterring Russian power in Europe, the European Union and European capitals need a unified strategy for filling the gaps left by a potential American disengagement from the continent. The Cold War–era strategy of containing the Soviet Union, originally articulated by George Kennan, could prove firm enough to be effective, while flexible enough to maintain European unity in confronting Russian power. This strategy of containment should be updated to reflect the particularities and complexities of the present day and reframed to avoid the pitfalls of its twentieth-century predecessor. Then as now, containment should aim to constrain the projection of Russian power and influence, while avoiding a direct conflict between Russia and the Western alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has marked a paradigm shift in how Europe must conceptualize relations with Moscow. After three decades of seeking to reconcile the expansion of the Euro-Atlantic security space with reassurance and engagement with Moscow, European states now find themselves the principal backers of Ukraine’s effort to preserve its territorial integrity and sovereignty as the United States looks to reduce its transatlantic commitments. Amid this crisis, Europe must grapple with the longer-term implications of an era of protracted confrontation with Russia, one that will almost certainly outlast the fighting in Ukraine. Whatever end state it achieves in Ukraine, Moscow will likely maintain its adversarial posture toward Europe, insofar as Europe remains committed to Atlanticism, liberalism, and European integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first three years of the conflict saw consistent transatlantic cooperation, with Washington providing substantial military assistance—including actionable intelligence—and working closely with European capitals, the European Union, and NATO to ensure a coordinated response. Despite frictions over weapons deliveries, strikes on Russian territory, and other issues, Europe and the United States maintained a common outlook on securing a favorable outcome to the war. The arrival of the Trump administration in 2025 has raised new questions about the nature and extent of transatlantic comity, with the White House calling for a concentration of resources in the Indo-Pacific theater. While some of these shifts could stall or be reversed after the next U.S. election, they testify to a new strategic reality facing Europe, which must now bear more of the burden of keeping Ukraine in the fight and ensuring a stable postwar settlement on the continent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greater strategic clarity and unity is paramount. Prior to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Europe was divided in its posture and policy toward Moscow. In Europe’s east, former Warsaw Pact states viewed Russia as a hostile actor and advocated a hawkish approach toward Moscow. However, splits emerged as far-right leaders in Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Bulgaria took a softer line. Western Europe, meanwhile, tended to adopt a more transactional approach toward Russia, embodied by Germany’s support for the Nord Stream 1 and 2 natural gas pipelines, the United Kingdom’s embrace of Russian oligarch wealth, and decades of efforts by Western European leaders to engage Russian President Vladimir Putin. The stark split between Western and Eastern Europe on Russia policy left the European Union divided and without a coherent policy toward Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the United States now playing less of a deterrent role, it is paramount that Europe develop a common strategy toward dealing with the threat and challenge posed by a revanchist Russia. It is often difficult for “Europe” to reach a common foreign policy approach, as Europe often exists in slightly different formats—the European Union and NATO have overlapping but not identical memberships. However, it will be vital for the future of European security that Europe, meaning the European Union plus the United Kingdom and Norway, adopt a common long-term strategy toward Russia. There has been considerable talk of power shifting eastward within the European Union, demonstrated by two prominent Baltic political leaders gaining top foreign and security positions within the grouping. Yet a common strategy toward Russia can only be forged through the support and backing of Berlin, given the size and importance of Germany within the European Union. Thus, the future of German foreign policy toward Russia will set the tone for the bloc. Furthermore, EU and UK alignment on defense and foreign policy is critical and has become a cornerstone of rebuilding cross-channel relations post-Brexit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe and Russia will likely remain antagonists for years to come. The Kremlin possesses immense disruptive global power and is willing to take great risks to advance its geopolitical agenda, including potentially even risking a land incursion into NATO territory. Coping with Russia will demand a long-term strategy for Europe, one that echoes containment, which guided the United States through the Cold War—what President John F. Kennedy called a “long, twilight struggle” against the Soviet Union. More than 75 years have passed since the U.S. diplomat George Kennan first formulated that strategy in his famous “Long Telegram” from Moscow. In his ensuing 1947 Foreign Affairs article, “The Sources of Soviet Conduct,” Kennan described containment as a political strategy reinforced by “the adroit and vigilant application of counterforce at a series of constantly shifting geographical and political points.” The goal was to avoid direct conflict with the Soviet Union while halting the spread of Soviet power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kennan was writing for an American audience at a moment when much of Europe remained prostrate from World War II. Today, however, a wealthy, democratic Europe will have to take on more of the burden of containing Russia’s renewed campaign to expand its influence and weaken the West. This report calls for a new European containment strategy for Russia in full recognition of Europe’s structural complexities. What is critical is that European states, the European Union, and Europe’s NATO members adopt a common strategic approach toward Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new containment strategy must account for the novelty of the present moment in other ways as well. Kennan’s vision of containment focused primarily on Central and Eastern Europe. While the lands and peoples lying between the European Union and Russia will again be central to the success of a containment strategy, European leaders will have to account for the fact that Europe itself is no longer the pivot for global geopolitics. A modern containment strategy must grapple in particular with the role of China, which is both an enabler of Russia’s war effort and a rising global power that will remain the central focus of U.S. foreign policy during the Trump administration and beyond. It will also have to account for the shifting, perhaps unpredictable role that the United States itself will play in European security in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A refashioned containment strategy would presume that Russia will continue trying to dominate Ukraine. Containing Russia in Ukraine means keeping the line of contact as close to the Russian border as possible, thereby constraining Russia’s expansionist tendencies. But containment will remain necessary irrespective of how the war in Ukraine ends. As in Kennan’s day, a containment strategy seeks to check Moscow’s aggression without risking a direct conflict. But it is not enough to dust off Kennan’s prescriptions. The past is a guide, but new times call for new thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;drawing-lessons-from-the-containment-strategy-toward-the-soviet-union&quot;&gt;Drawing Lessons from the Containment Strategy Toward the Soviet Union&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-led-to-containment&quot;&gt;What Led to Containment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cold War containment strategy arose in response to two basic circumstances. The first was the recognition, after 1945, that the Soviet Union was expansionary. Moscow was projecting its military power into new theaters—from East Germany to Iran to the Korean Peninsula. At the same time, Moscow’s political influence was spreading via the international communist movement, whose different parties were loyal to the Soviet Union to varying degrees. The rise of a communist China supercharged the task of managing an ascendent and ambitious Soviet Union. The second circumstance was the advent of the nuclear age. Although the United States had a monopoly on nuclear weapons from 1945 to 1949, Washington could not assume that there would be only one nuclear power in the world. From the beginning, it had to presume that the Soviet Union might join the ranks of the nuclear powers, though by the measurement of its remarkable conventional power in 1945, even a non-nuclear Soviet Union was effectively undefeatable. This condition of having an undefeatable adversary forced creative ways of thinking on the United States, which had entered World War II with the explicit (and militarily traditional) goal of defeating Nazi Germany and imperial Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Containment answered the dilemma of what to do about the Soviet Union. Key to containment was the refusal to accept widening spheres of influence for the Soviet Union, particularly in Europe. Containment was about holding the line, as evidenced by Washington’s unwillingness to concede West Berlin to Soviet control in the late 1940s. Containment also led to the Korean War in 1950, when Soviet and Chinese power combined to produce a military confrontation on the Korean Peninsula. Well into the 1950s, containment demanded high levels of military expenditure, part of which was used to hold the line in places like West Berlin and South Korea, and part of which was used to deter the Soviet Union directly. The establishment of the NATO alliance must be understood within the strategic parameters of containment. In addition to holding the line, containment entailed the management of conflict with the Soviet Union; it eschewed regime change in the short to medium term (with some expectation that the Soviet Union’s internal contradictions may lead the country to defeat itself, or “mellow,” in Kennan’s words, over time); and it did not threaten the territorial integrity of the Soviet Union itself. Nor did containment threaten the territorial integrity of the Warsaw Pact states, which were under Soviet control throughout the Cold War. If NATO existed within the strategic parameters of containment, so too did arms control and negotiation with the Soviet Union. Occasionally at risk of being contradictory, containment was at its best a flexible strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;versions-of-containment&quot;&gt;Versions of Containment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different versions of containment crystallized around the influential figure of U.S. diplomat George Kennan. At first, Kennan argued against any kind of diplomacy with the Soviet Union: He judged Soviet leader Joseph Stalin to be too deceptive and intransigent for normal diplomatic back-and-forth. Especially after Stalin’s death in 1953, however, Kennan came to feel that containing the Soviet Union could be combined with conventional diplomacy. Kennan also emphasized two particular aspects of containment. The first was that it was primarily a political doctrine and that stemming the spread of Soviet communism had to be practiced through support for democracy (among allies) and by the setting of a good political example. The second was that covert methods were preferable to anything resembling direct military confrontation. As with diplomacy, Kennan would change his mind about covert action in later phases of the Cold War, coming to feel that the United States had too zealously embraced covert action in its struggle with Soviet communism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kennan’s intellectual rival in the U.S. government was Paul Nitze, his successor as director of policy planning at the State Department and later a U.S. deputy secretary of defense. Nitze placed a higher premium on military confrontation with the Soviet Union, an ideological reading of the Cold War as a titanic struggle between liberty and tyranny, and the use of fear to mobilize the American population into supporting high levels of defense spending. Nitze won many of his bureaucratic arguments with Kennan in the 1950s. The American president who revived Nitze’s thinking, after the catastrophe of the Vietnam War, was Ronald Reagan. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, three years after Reagan left the White House, many Americans concluded that Reagan’s robust language and actions, along with high levels of military spending, had won the Cold War for the United States. But with the overreach of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, and then again with the deterioration of relations between Moscow and Washington since Russia’s first invasion of Ukraine in 2014, Kennan’s version of containment began getting a second look by policymakers in Washington. The intellectual battle between Nitze and Kennan continues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cold War containment was never anything other than a transatlantic venture, even if the strategic tone was initially set in Washington. Over time, France and the United Kingdom would join the United States as nuclear powers, holding up a nuclear umbrella over Western Europe. West Germany engaged in serious rearmament in the 1950s and 1960s, joining the United States and a host of other NATO member states to balance out the conventional military superiority that the Soviet Union had in Europe throughout the Cold War. On the cultural and political plane, Europe and the United States were in agreement about the imperative of stopping the spread of Soviet power, which Moscow attempted to disseminate across Europe through structures designed to promote sympathy for Soviet communism. Through espionage and subversion and through active measures, Russia attempted to weaken the underpinnings of European and transatlantic unity. But while Europeans at times chafed at certain Cold War decisions made in the United States—which sat far removed from the frontlines of Soviet campaigns—on balance they were deeply committed to containment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;problems-of-containment&quot;&gt;Problems of Containment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Containment led to two core problems. The first was its potential to spill over into regional wars. Historians have increasingly rethought this aspect of the Cold War. Not only did the Vietnam War end in failure for the United States, and at enormous cost to the people of Vietnam, but Washington found itself embroiled in many bloody conflicts throughout what was then called the “third world.” A large price was paid for these conflicts, even when U.S. forces themselves were not the ones doing the fighting. For one, they damaged the United States’ global reputation, leaving millions upon millions of people skeptical about the claims made in Washington about democracy and human rights. In a different sense, these wars and conflicts undermined support for a strong Cold War policy within the United States itself. In the 1960s and 1970s, the United States experienced a great deal of civic unrest, some of which was derived from the sense that what Washington was doing abroad—particularly in Southeast Asia—was morally questionable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Containment’s second, and related, problem was its lack of nuance. Too often the strategy was pursued as a one-size-fits-all approach. In Vietnam, U.S. policymakers fundamentally misunderstood the nature of the conflict, precisely because they viewed it through a containment lens. They failed to see the significance of Vietnamese nationalism and the resentment of foreign interference in the country’s domestic affairs; the different political patterns in the nations and cultures of Indochina; and that China too could be perceived (in Vietnam and elsewhere) as a source of foreign interference. The Vietnam War provided a microcosm of a core problem of U.S. Cold War foreign policy. When containment shaded over into regime change, as it occasionally did in U.S. Cold War policy, it led to unpredictable and negative consequences. For instance, U.S. efforts to topple the Iranian government in the 1950s created layers of resentment that directly enabled the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Containment needed to be balanced with careful and precise analysis of local and regional dynamics. Yet such analysis was more the exception than the norm. Again and again, the simplistic application of containment to situations of great internal complexity led to policy failures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;containment-as-a-strategic-success&quot;&gt;Containment as a Strategic Success&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all its problems, containment was a remarkably successful strategy that accomplished three goals. First, it did not overstretch the United States and its European partners. When the Soviet Union fell apart in 1991, all were still committed to containment, and all were economically viable states: There was enough political will, enough financial backing, and enough societal agreement on the validity of containment for the strategy to prevail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the Soviet Union was contained—not everywhere and not perfectly to be sure—but sufficiently. Western Europe remained free from Soviet domination. So too did Greece, Turkey, and much of the Middle East, along with Japan and South Korea. Latin America and Africa had checkered histories in this regard, but in no sense were they overrun by the Soviet Union during the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, there was no nuclear conflict. It came close during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, and there were other moments of high tension, but ultimately the worst was avoided. Because containment had left room for diplomacy, there was an elaborate architecture of arms control in existence by 1991. It would endure for about three decades after the Cold War, which is more surprising than the recent unraveling of arms control between Russia and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-strategic-case-for-containment-of-russia-in-ukraine-and-globally&quot;&gt;The Strategic Case for Containment of Russia in Ukraine and Globally&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;containment-strategy-today&quot;&gt;Containment Strategy Today&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Containment has three advantages as a contemporary strategy toward Russia. First, because Russia is expansionary, the spread of Russian political and military power can either be accepted as unavoidable, or it can be contained—within and outside of Ukraine. To accept an expansionary Russia in Europe (and elsewhere) would be to undermine the foundations of liberal international order based on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states big and small, which has been instrumental in Europe’s post-1945 peace and development. A collapse of this order will be followed by multiplying threats to European security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, containment, if carefully pursued, will keep escalation in check. It will not tip over into calls for regime change, and it will take into account the reality that Putin’s Russia is a nuclear power that also maintains the conventional capacity to inflict enormous damage on Europe. There is sufficient evidence that Russia is, indeed, containable. It is a myth that Putin always fights to the finish. When faced with a superior force and resistance, Putin often backs down, as he has from multiple threats of retaliation over U.S. and European support for Ukraine. Containment is not the absence of escalation—it is escalation within strategic and discursive limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, containment meets the fundamental needs of Europe, pinning outcomes to preventing the spread of Russian military power within Ukraine. It is anything but appeasement. It also can be communicated as a strategy that does not amount to a blank check, that honors the imperative of restraint, and that helps with the prioritization of foreign policy problems and budgeting. Policymakers can present containment to European citizens concerned about costs, escalation, and other risks as a strategy that emerges from the political center and that, if successful, could strengthen that center. It is a strategy that is neither quiescent or passive on the one hand, nor extreme or militaristic on the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nor does it require a large investment of U.S. financial or military resources over the longer term. While Europe will not be able to fully replace U.S. capabilities, it can do enough to make a containment strategy viable with limited U.S. backstops. Europe taking the lead on devising and implementing a new containment strategy could reinforce transatlantic relations by allowing the U.S. government to prioritize other strategic challenges such as China, while limiting Russia’s assertiveness as long as the existing restrictions and their enforcement remains in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-nature-of-the-russian-threat&quot;&gt;The Nature of the Russian Threat&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has a global strategy to diminish Western influence within existing international institutions, develop and expand new nonliberal or illiberal multilateral institutions, reassert its hegemony in much of Eurasia, and roll back Western power from strategic regions of the globe (as well as outer space). This strategy of revision and expansion is now central to the Putin regime’s ideology and domestic legitimation. It also has strong echoes in Russian and Soviet history that will make it likely to endure even after Putin departs the stage. Russia is not the only expansionist, revisionist power challenging the West and the world order it prefers, but in many ways Russia is the most ambitious and aggressive adversary Europe faces because of its willingness to use force to disrupt the existing international order and its long-standing strategic focus on maintaining a sphere of influence around its borders. It is also the principal driver of an emerging autocratic axis encompassing Iran, North Korea, and (to some degree) China that presents the democratic West with the most complex strategic challenge it has faced since the end of the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has consolidated the preeminence of this worldview inside Russia, while exacerbating anti-Western resentment. The war has also forced the Kremlin to confront many of the weaknesses facing its military and defense industrial base, including outdated technology and production bottlenecks. Following massive wartime investments in the defense industry, the Russian military is projected to come out of the Ukraine war with greater material capabilities than it went in with. Shortages of personnel will likely present the Kremlin a greater challenge; nevertheless, its policy of paying large bonuses to recruits has reinvigorated the economy of formerly derelict regions and ensured a minimally adequate flow of recruits. Moscow has been able to compensate for its shortage of personnel with mercenaries and troop contingents from North Korea and elsewhere. Even if the cost of these expedients makes them impractical over the longer term, they demonstrate how the Kremlin can improvise solutions to its vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In three years of the ongoing war in Ukraine, Russia has demonstrated remarkable agility, defying many pessimistic forecasts. Having become the most sanctioned country in the world, it has managed to maneuver around many economic constraints, keeping revenues from energy sales high and its budget balanced, investing in the military and defense industry, ramping up domestic production of weapons and equipment, and boosting economic growth. At the moment, Russia appears economically and socially resilient and has adjusted to the sanctions-induced disruption of its ties with the West. Although defense spending is set to reach a post-Soviet record of 6.3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2025 (7.2 percent including related expenditures) and is expected to rise further despite growing signs of economic slowdown or recession, Russia’s economy appears sustainable for the next few years. Despite having suffered around one million casualties and losing hundreds of armored vehicles and artillery pieces per month on average over the last three years, Russia is estimated to be able to continue waging the war at the current level of attrition at least until 2027. The Kremlin has maintained social stability thanks to its efforts to create a wide pool of stakeholders among the elites and working classes and to boost domestic repression, propaganda, and ideological indoctrination, as well as the exodus of opposition-minded Russians and the popularity of triumphant propagandistic narratives in contemporary Russian culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s war-induced socioeconomic changes have been so significant that the process of societal militarization is unlikely to stop even if the war in Ukraine were to end. Because military spending has by now become the main driver of economic growth, the end of hostilities will not lead to a radical cut-off of military investment. Russia will likely continue inflating its military industrial sector, and by most assessments will be able to reconstitute its army within the next decade. Besides conventional capabilities, Russia’s sophisticated and persistently evolving tool kit of aggression includes cyberattacks, coordinated disinformation, artificial migration crises, proxy actors, airspace violations, assassinations, political interference, and operations against critical infrastructure. This hybrid tool kit allows the Kremlin to move swiftly, run higher risks, and act aggressively across various domains. Accordingly, despite being inferior to NATO in terms of its conventional capabilities, today’s Russia represents a bigger challenge to European security than it did at the start of 2022. The Kremlin is learning from its past mistakes, upgrading its methods, and growing more emboldened by what it perceives as a Western inability to confront and contain it. Moscow’s ongoing large-scale military reforms signal that Russia could be preparing for some kind of future confrontation with NATO within roughly the next decade—including even a large-scale conventional war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implementing-containment&quot;&gt;Implementing Containment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ukraine-and-the-containment-of-russia&quot;&gt;Ukraine and the Containment of Russia&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cheapest way for Europe to contain Russia is by assisting Ukraine. As of now, there are three plausible scenarios for how the war in Ukraine could play out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is Russian victory. In this scenario, tension and hostility would move closer to the borders of NATO. The fear of Russian invasion would percolate throughout Poland and the Baltic states, and the mistrust and friction between Russia and the West might well increase. Ukraine itself would be a failed state and source of chronic instability for Europe, or it would be a de facto Russian protectorate, like Belarus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second scenario is a long, inconclusive war. In this case it would be in Europe’s interest to keep the line of contact between Ukraine and Russia as close to Russia as possible, and prevent it from moving westward. In this scenario, Kyiv could consolidate a functioning state in much of the country, acting as a buffer between Europe and Russia. Long-term consolidation of a prosperous, democratic Ukraine could exert a magnetic pull on Russian-occupied regions of eastern Ukraine (and on Russia itself), much as West Germany did with East Germany during the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third, and preferred, scenario is Ukraine’s victory and recovery of its occupied territory. While this is unlikely at the moment, a Russian defeat in Ukraine may trigger a wide variance of outcomes, such as precipitating regime collapse or, conversely, causing Moscow to “lash out” more aggressively elsewhere, necessitating further containment. Russia might lose the war but not necessarily the intent of occupying Ukrainian territory or of sponsoring regime change in Kyiv. So long as the intent and the capacity for such meddling and aggression remain, containment will be strategically salient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fate of Ukraine remains fundamental to Europe’s security and to the success of a new containment strategy writ large. While a new strategy does not depend on Ukrainian victory, it should still retain Ukrainian victory as a long-term strategic goal. Forcing Russia to abandon most or all of its conquests will push the Russian threat further from Europe’s borders, forcing the Kremlin to grapple with the consequences of a failed war of aggression—much as the Soviet Union did after the Afghanistan debacle in the 1980s. A Ukrainian victory would encourage other countries to push back against Russian malign influence, especially across Europe and Eurasia. Conversely, a conclusion of the war on Russia’s terms could result in a new division of power and spheres of influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine will require sustained Western military assistance. Importantly, the need to aid Ukraine will not stop when the fighting stops, as Kyiv will be in a race to rearm and rebuild its military capacity to deter future Russian aggression. It will also have to rebuild huge amounts of infrastructure, housing, and other assets destroyed during the war. Therefore, Europe will be asked by Kyiv to provide sustained military support, similar to that provided by the United States to Israel. Should Western governments prove willing to provide durable security guarantees to Ukraine, including potentially NATO membership, the urgency of the task to recapitalize Ukraine’s military will be reduced, since it would then have an effective deterrent to future Russian aggression. But without Western security guarantees, Ukraine will need to sustain a massive military force for the indefinite future, with deleterious effects on its civilian economy and standard of living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, European militaries will also need to significantly rearm to deter Russia. The shambolic state of the European defense industrial base is an acute military vulnerability vis-à-vis Russia, in addition to being a major source of tension with the United States. Thus, Europe should focus its efforts on ramping up defense industrial production, both to support Ukraine and to rearm itself. This will require not just significant outlays of funding but also greater integration and coordination of European procurement efforts, ideally involving Ukraine and Ukrainian firms as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;energy-russias-economic-achilles-heel&quot;&gt;Energy: Russia’s Economic Achilles’ Heel&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given their significance to the Russian economy, the dynamics of the global oil and gas markets should be taken into account in any containment strategy. While there is no way to predict the future of global energy prices, at some point global oil prices are likely to fall, creating significant economic and potential regime difficulties for Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on the Soviet economy, former Russian Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar explained in 2007 that in the late 1970s, “The hard currency from oil exports stopped the growing food supply crisis, increased the import of equipment and consumer goods, ensured a financial base for the arms race and the achievement of nuclear parity with the United States, and permitted the realization of such risky foreign policy actions as the war in Afghanistan.” Conversely, the drop in oil prices in the 1980s damaged the Soviet economy, prompting Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev’s reforms. Low oil prices in the 1990s added to Russia’s troubles and helped precipitate the 1998 financial crisis and the ruble’s collapse. The dramatic increase in oil prices in the 2000s bolstered Putin’s government and gave the Kremlin the resources necessary to modernize the Russian military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Russian economy was buoyed by the increase in global energy prices. Yet future changes in the oil market and the acceleration of the green transition create real vulnerabilities for Russia that can be exploited by the West. The Russian economy remains heavily dependent on fossil fuel exports. Over the past decade, the oil and gas sectors together have contributed to 30 to 50 percent of Russia’s total federal budget revenues and amounted to 20 percent of GDP on average, with oil constituting about 70 to 80 percent of that total. Oil prices futures will continue to have a dramatic effect on Russia’s ability to amass and project power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine saw the West impose significant economic sanctions, but these only mildly targeted the energy sector. The West has feared that aggressive action against Russia’s energy industry would trigger a global economic crisis and worsen inflation in the United States and Europe. The throttling of gas exports to Europe by Russia and the destruction of the Nord Stream pipelines have effectively closed off much of the European gas market to Russia. This development hit Europe’s economy hard, but it may hurt Russia more, stranding much of its gas supply in western Siberia. Russia has tried to involve China in building the Power of Siberia II pipeline to redirect stranded gas, but Beijing has shown little interest. In response, Russia is seeking to build up its liquified natural gas (LNG) export capacity, but this has proven easier said than done, especially as sanctions and perceptions of political risk have caused foreign investment to practically dry up since the start of the full-scale war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of natural gas on Russia’s budget is minor relative to the role of oil. The West’s efforts to impose an oil price cap to force Russia to sell its oil below global market value have had mixed results. The Group of Seven (G7) price cap and the corresponding European oil embargo put in place in December 2022 did impact Russia’s energy revenue, forcing Russia to procure a “shadow fleet” of tankers and alter its supply routes to Asia. Recent efforts to crack down on the shadow fleet have stalled deliveries and pushed Russian oil prices further below the G7 cap, cutting into the country’s budget revenues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decline in energy prices from the spike in 2022, the loss of the European gas market, and the extra costs to redirect oil to Asia have had some impact on the Russian economy. Russian gas output has fallen by more than 15 percent since the war began thanks to the loss of the European market. Alongside Russia’s efforts to diversify its revenue by increasing non-energy taxes, these factors contributed to the share of oil and gas in government revenue falling from 42 percent in 2022 to about 30 percent in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Russia’s fossil fuel exports have kept its economy and therefore its war effort afloat, time is likely not on Russia’s side. Aside from the impact of war and sanctions, there are various economic and energy trends that could gravely impact Russia’s economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the short term, the world may have an oil glut of new production. In 2024, the International Energy Agency (IEA) projected that global oil production capacity will far outpace demand, with the latter plateauing by 2030. A world of excess oil supply could lower prices and slow the energy transition. Prospects for a global economic slowdown are putting additional downward pressure on oil prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the long term, the clean energy transition should reduce global oil demand. More than 50 percent of global oil demand comes from the transportation sector, with 25 percent of total demand—or about 25 million barrels per day—due to passenger travel. Road freight, aviation, and shipping make up the other half and will be harder to abate. Encouraging and accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) globally will impact Russia’s economic prospects, making the energy transition a key part of any containment strategy. The IEA predicts that oil demand in advanced economies will fall sharply by 2030. The West will then be less politically and economically sensitive to global oil prices, which may have a significant impact on the willingness of Western, and particularly U.S., policymakers to target Russia’s oil sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the green transition accelerates not just in developed but in developing markets, it could further lower global demand. In China, for instance, new data shows that 50 percent of new cars sold this year are EVs or plug-in hybrid vehicles. Chinese overproduction of EVs may also flood developing markets in Asia and Latin America, not to mention Europe itself, accelerating the adoption of EVs in emerging economies that would put additional downward pressure on the global demand for oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a major consumer of oil and gas, Europe has some ability to shape these price dynamics through its investments and regulatory actions. Figuring out ways to deprive the Russian state of critical export revenue will weaken its ability to wage new wars, modernize its military, and maintain social services critical to sustaining public support for the regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-nuclear-factor&quot;&gt;The Nuclear Factor&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moscow has successfully deterred more intense Western intervention in Ukraine in part because of its substantial nuclear arsenal, which is roughly equal to that of the United States. Russia has gradually raised the nuclear temperature vis-à-vis the West by (1) engaging in nuclear “saber-rattling”; (2) taking additional steps up the escalation ladder, such as moving tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, hinting at the possibility of a nuclear test, and announcing revisions to its nuclear doctrine; (3) rejecting offers to return to nuclear arms control talks with the United States; and (4) reducing its support for nuclear nonproliferation efforts, especially in relation to North Korea and Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The constraints on Russia’s actual use of a nuclear weapon remain real: Moscow’s risk aversion vis-à-vis NATO in the context of the Ukraine war suggests that nuclear deterrence with the United States continues to hold. Russia’s key partners in the Global South—as well as China—have also warned the Kremlin against using nuclear weapons. Still, a containment strategy with regard to Russia should assume that Moscow will remain comfortable with a higher level of systemic nuclear risk than Western states. Containment should also prepare for the fact that Russia’s irresponsible nuclear actions will have a cumulative impact over the medium term. Moscow is establishing a more dangerous nuclear environment. Within it, nuclear escalation may become more likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russia-regionally-and-globally&quot;&gt;Russia Regionally and Globally&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia is doubling down on its long-standing effort to diminish Western influence in the heart of Eurasia. Russian-backed gray zone operations aim to destabilize pro-Western governments in Moldova and Armenia. Moscow is also using a mixture of carrots and sticks to contest or squeeze out Western influence in states like Azerbaijan, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Georgia, and Serbia. All of these states are in or closely tied to Europe, and Russia’s ability to influence them has a direct impact on European security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond Eurasia, Russia is taking advantage of disillusionment with the West to establish outposts of influence in Latin America, Africa, and elsewhere. Many of these interventions are opportunistic and of limited strategic importance. Others, though, pose a challenge to Western counterterrorism campaigns—for instance, in the Sahel region—or access to critical resources. And efforts such as those in Libya and Sudan could allow Moscow to imperil vital lines of communication in the Mediterranean and Red Seas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Russian intervention in the Global South aligns with steps to transform the liberal international order to one more favorable to authoritarianism and regional blocs. Along with China, Russia is at the forefront of efforts to promote alternative institutions of global governance. Institutions such as the BRICS alliance and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) lack the binding rules and commitment to liberal principles underpinning much of the international system crafted in the West at the end of World War II and given global remit by the collapse of the Soviet Bloc between 1989 and 1991. As Moscow emphasizes the lasting nature of its break with the West, it is increasingly pushing for these organizations to both expand their geographic scope (e.g., allowing Iran to join the BRICS and the SCO as a full member) and take on new functional capabilities to duplicate or replace many of the global governance tasks performed by legacy multilateral institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;WESTERN EUROPE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has highlighted the Russian security threat to the European continent above and below the threshold of war. These Russian actions, variously described as “active measures,” “hybrid warfare,” or “gray zone activities,” will pose a major challenge to European security in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s aim with these actions is two-fold: To undermine support for Ukraine and pursue a broader long-term revisionist challenge to Europe and the U.S.-led global order. The Kremlin views both conventional and unconventional military means as tools of national power and applies them in combination. The basic characteristic of this Russian line of effort is actions to harm or undermine its adversary that possess a degree of deniability, making these actions unlikely to trigger a wider war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s goal with these efforts remains to erode European political and societal cohesion, test European focus and resolve, and serve as an asymmetric deterrent—imposing costs or threatening to impose costs on Europe for actions taken against Russia. More broadly, these efforts strive to cause death by a thousand cuts. Each action viewed in isolation may appear rather limited in significance, but taken together they have the potential to have strategic effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Russia may not be able to retaliate with sanctions, it can impose costs through active measures. Former Central Intelligence Agency Director William Burns and Richard Moore, chief of the UK Secret Intelligence Service, described a “reckless campaign of sabotage across Europe being waged by Russian intelligence, and its cynical use of technology to spread lies and disinformation designed to drive wedges between us.” A spate of unexplained attacks on gas pipelines and data cables in northern Europe have demonstrated the threat and inspired a range of European Union and NATO initiatives to protect critical infrastructure. Russia has been accused of being responsible for reports of explosive devices in DHL packages and aircraft, and a number of industrial arson attacks and drone usage targeting sensitive facilities. Russia has also stepped up its sabotage campaign across the European Union, as demonstrated, for example, by weaponization of immigration, a wave of attacks on gas pipelines and data cables in northern Europe, and the “Operation DoppelGänger” disinformation campaign disseminated through a network of cloned websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has also assassinated defectors. From the use of a chemical weapon to attempt to kill Russian defector Sergei Skripal in the United Kingdom to killing a Russian helicopter pilot who defected to Spain, Putin’s Russia has used assassinations as a tool of foreign policy. These assassinations serve to both intimidate and deter. The foiled plot to assassinate the head of Rheinmetall, one of the main producers of weapons being sent to Ukraine, would represent Russia taking its efforts a step further and actively seeking to punish those in the West supporting Ukraine and therefore to intimidate and deter others from doing the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia may prioritize political interference in particular. Russia sees this as a key vector to erode Europe’s political cohesion and undermine transatlantic relations with relatively low risk of significant blowback. Moreover, the shock of Russian political interference in the West has subsided and even become somewhat normalized, thus making Russia fear little in terms of reprisals. Reduced U.S. commitment to European security would further ease these fears, making the escalation of such attacks increasingly likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nature of European politics may make Europe more vulnerable to Russian interference than the United States or other countries. The regulated nature of European politics—with the amount of money, advertising, and campaigning often being more tightly controlled than elsewhere—means that covert financial or campaign support may have a more sizable impact. Relatively small amounts of money and effort, especially related to online influence campaigns, can have significant political effects. Indeed, there have now been numerous credible allegations of Russian actors seeking to provide financial support to far-right and far-left political figures and parties across Europe. Increasing support for antiestablishment parties and parties seeking a rapprochement with Russia is a cost-effective way to impact European cohesion. Europe, with its frequent elections, is a target-rich environment, where even a small country’s vote can shift EU or NATO dynamics through a Trojan horse leader or party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Washington potentially reducing its focus on European security, Moscow may further escalate its activities. The present dynamic may soon resemble the early days of espionage in the Cold War, where seemingly few clear redlines existed, with each side pushing the boundaries of what the other side could tolerate. Given the resurgent and emboldened Kremlin, the risk of hybrid escalation in Europe will increase rapidly in the coming years. As the Russian hybrid threat to Europe continues to evolve and intensify, Europe should be prepared to understand, mitigate, and prevent an inadvertent and uncontrolled escalation scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem for Europe, however, is that its tools for deterring and responding to Russian hybrid attacks and political warfare are no longer clear. Europe has already used many of the tools at its disposal to respond to Russia’s invasion. Sanctions have been put in place, “diplomats” have been expelled, and Russian economic and oligarchic interests in the West have been seized or evicted. Thus, Europe now has fewer means left to retaliate and impose direct costs on Russia short of military force, meaning Europe’s ability to deter has weakened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe must now be hypervigilant and call out Russian active measures and interference efforts. Counterintelligence efforts and pan-European coordination and solidarity will be important. One way to deter these attacks is to raise awareness of their wide-reaching impacts, thereby turning them into political rallying points that can build support among European publics for a long-term containment strategy. However, European leaders need to guard against creating a new “red scare” like that seen in the United States in the 1950s, when Senator Joseph McCarthy fanned societal fears of the Soviet-backed communist movement to target internal political enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe therefore needs to think about the tools it has to impose costs on Russia for its hybrid attacks. The most obvious method is direct support for Ukraine, whereby exposure of Russian measures could prompt European leaders to approve a new aid package or introduce a more advanced system to the battlefield. Alternatively, a Russian cyberattack or kinetic attack on critical infrastructure could prompt Europe to diplomatically or economically pressure China to reduce its support for Russia. In addition, Europe could escalate its existing efforts at sanctions enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, Europe may need to think about developing tools and means to respond in kind. Such tit-for-tat responses may not have equivalent impact, as a hypothetical European cyberattack on a Russian hospital system may not have the same political impact on the Kremlin as one in Europe. Nevertheless, to deter Russia, particularly without the backing of the U.S. intelligence community and U.S. Cyber Command, Europe may need to develop its ability to respond unilaterally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EASTERN EUROPE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has positioned Central and Eastern Europe on the front line of the new strategic competition between Russia and the West. While states along NATO’s eastern flank—including Poland, the Baltic countries, and Romania—worry about the expansion of the Ukraine war or Russian gray zone escalation, it is “in-between” states like Moldova, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, and even Serbia that are most exposed to Russian-backed destabilization. Both eastern flank states and “in-between” states need reinforcement as part of a containment strategy. Containment will, however, look vastly different for countries in each of these two categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO’s military capabilities along its eastern flank have been shored up over the past decade, beginning with the Enhanced Forward Presence adopted in the aftermath of Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea and invasion of Donbas. Post-2022 deployments have shifted NATO’s center of gravity to the east, with Germany playing a key role, including through the deployment of Panzerbrigade 45 to Lithuania. The challenge for NATO members will lie in ensuring these deployments and commitments are maintained over the longer term. Budgetary pressures and calls to distribute the burden of protecting NATO’s eastern flank more equitably are likely to shape the intra-alliance debate, especially in the event of a ceasefire in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The indications from the Trump administration that the United States plans to shift the burden of European security to Europe, with the Pentagon planning significant force withdrawals, will leave Europe with a tremendous military challenge. Filling the gap left by departing U.S. forces will require Europe to both spend more and to reorganize itself militarily. In particular, Europeans will need to ensure they are able to fight as Europeans—and have the stockpiles to sustain an attritional war against Russia. European militaries currently lack the ammunition—from high-end long-range missiles to low-end artillery—to sustain a war against Russia. This will require not just procuring weapons from external suppliers but building a robust and capable defense industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, given the difficulties of dislodging an entrenched force, Europeans will need to ensure they are ready and able to defend every inch of EU and NATO territory at the outset of conflict, because once territory is lost, uprooting Russian forces may prove incredibly costly. NATO’s current posture in the Baltics, with multinational tripwire forces, is not enough of a deterrent. Russia may calculate that it can overwhelm this tripwire force, absorb NATO’s initial barrage of strikes, and then make major territorial gains as European forces run out of munitions and follow-on forces take time to deploy to the region. Thus, Europe needs to worry that its perceived military weakness will invite Russian aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of the European Union and NATO, Moldova and the non-NATO states of the Western Balkans are uniquely vulnerable because of their location, institutional weaknesses, and Russian influence among disaffected segments of the population, especially ethnic minorities. In Moldova, the 2024 election and commitment to EU integration offer a window of opportunity for Brussels and EU member states to encourage anticorruption measures that will root out sources of malign Russian influence and accelerate Chişinău’s path to EU membership. In the Western Balkans, the West’s leverage is premised on the promise of integration into transatlantic organizations. Given that those integration efforts have stalled, Russia is able to play on dissatisfaction with pro-Western reform efforts and hijack domestic politics by leveraging interethnic and political tensions in countries like Bosnia-Herzegovina and Montenegro. Russia exerts its influence in the region through hybrid activities, propaganda, and continuing energy sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE SOUTH CAUCASUS AND CENTRAL ASIA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moscow aspires to wall off the South Caucasus from Western influence by leveraging geoeconomic tools and its influence over key political actors in Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia. These states are critical to Europe because they control access to Central Asia and serve as an important source of hydrocarbons. Even amid rising strategic competition, the South Caucasus—and even more so Central Asia—will remain a low priority for Europe. Still, European leaders should focus on ensuring the sovereignty and territorial integrity of these states, including the ability to maintain trade and transit ties with the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the Second Karabakh War in 2020, Moscow has pursued a strategic alignment with Azerbaijan (and its ally, Turkey) to bypass Western sanctions. It has also forged close ties with the ruling Georgian Dream party to imperil Tbilisi’s pursuit of Euro-Atlantic integration. While Armenia has pivoted toward the West since the Second Karabakh War, Russian influence in Azerbaijan and Georgia risks leaving Yerevan isolated and vulnerable to further aggression. Russia aims to partner with Turkey and Iran to establish a regional condominium in the South Caucasus and isolate the region from Western influence. While Georgia remains a formal candidate for EU membership and has been promised eventual membership in NATO, it is highly unlikely to join either organization anytime soon. Without Georgia, Armenia’s prospects for Euro-Atlantic integration remain slim as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moscow has meanwhile leveraged its economic and energy connections to Central Asia to facilitate sanctions avoidance while bolstering trade ties, particularly with Eurasian Economic Union members Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. These states have also been important destinations for Russians fleeing the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the start of the war in Ukraine, Moscow has deported large numbers of Central Asian migrants, while press-ganging others into military service. These experiences are likely to erode goodwill toward Russia in much of the region, providing an opening for European outreach. The five Central Asian states have also made real progress addressing the sources of their mutual distrust, leading to greater regional cooperation and integration. Central Asia’s growing interconnectivity provides a hedge against a Russian imperial resurgence and (conceivably) increases the region’s ability to attract Western investors. The European Union’s decision to invest around €12 billion (roughly $14 billion) in Central Asia under the Global Gateway Initiative is a positive step that requires sustained follow-up, as well as coordination with like-minded partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest challenge to Russian influence is likely to remain the inexorable expansion of China’s economic and political footprints in the region. As long as Moscow and Beijing remain aligned strategically, Russia will continue to view Chinese influence in Central Asia as an acceptable price for Chinese support in Ukraine and at the level of global order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CHINA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A main difference between a strategy of containment toward Russia today compared to the Cold War is the global role reversal between Russia and China. During the Cold War, the major geopolitical competitor for the United States and its European allies was the Soviet Union, making Europe the geographic center for that competition. Today, China is seen by the United States as the “pacing challenge.” Thus, while Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has refocused NATO on its original core task of deterring Russia, the United States, as NATO’s key military actor, is focused more on Beijing than on Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is a key partner for Russia, not only in Ukraine, but also as an enabler of Russia’s challenge to the global order. There are reasons to believe Sino-Russian alignment is quite durable. The Sino-Soviet split during the Cold War erupted following Stalin’s death, and at its core was a fight over leadership of the global Communist movement. Modern commentators have often interpreted the Cold War schism as an indicator that there is an unseen fault line that is bound to shake the contemporary relationship at some point. But Russia and China today share a similar global outlook and are willing to set aside potential irritants to the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the Sino-Russian partnership is becoming increasingly one-sided, as Moscow has come to depend more and more on Beijing for trade, technology, military, and financial support. Russia’s challenge to global order is more radical than China’s, and a durable containment strategy should look for ways to exacerbate Chinese concerns over Russia’s destabilizing behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under current circumstances, it is unlikely that the United States, Europe, or their allies will be able to pry Russia and China apart. Both China and Russia share mutual concern over perceived U.S.-backed and instigated “color revolutions” and a desire to make the world “safe for autocracy.” They further share an interest in asserting territorial claims and control over neighboring countries and territories (much of the former Soviet Union for Russia; the South China Sea and Taiwan for China), and in moving away from a U.S.-led and dominated world order toward a multipolar one. If anything, since the start of Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the relationship between Russia and China has deepened, with the total value of imports and exports between the two having almost doubled from $141 billion in 2021 to $244.8 billion in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, there are clear limits to Chinese support for Russia. This is in part because Russia has much less to offer China. While Russia has provided China with high-end military technology and potential access to the Arctic, China has been reluctant to deepen energy ties, continually begging off Russian requests to build a new gas pipeline or boost investment. Deeply tied to the U.S.-led global financial system, China has sought to avoid major diplomatic and economic fallout over Ukraine and has resisted Moscow’s requests for direct lethal support. European leaders conveying to Beijing that providing lethal aid to Russia will have dire implications for its relations with Europe, its largest trade partner, serves as an additional deterrent to China’s more robust support of Russia. China has sought to build relations with Europe in order to maintain access to the European market, but also in the hopes of potentially creating a wedge in the Atlantic alliance. Chinese hopes of exacerbating divisions between the United States and Europe appear to have grown since Donald Trump’s election to a second term. Europe will need to do its part to maintain transatlantic coordination on China, even when doing so comes with definable costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;AFRICA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Russia has had success pushing European influence out of Africa in recent years, the Kremlin’s mounting resource constraints and a backlash against the brutality of Russian forces (especially those from the Wagner Group) create new opportunities. Russia’s inroads in Africa are a product of its ability to leverage anticolonial narratives and willingness to work with various unsavory actors, including Sahelian juntas, Sudanese warlords, or criminal syndicates. Its motives are both commercial and strategic, in the sense of displacing France and other postcolonial powers as the partner of choice. Its successes are grounded in the narrative that Moscow is the only partner willing to effectively fight separatism and terrorism in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE MIDDLE EAST&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Middle East, confrontation with the West has caused Moscow to tilt closer to Iran and its partners in the “axis of resistance” (see below). This trend has intensified amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza, in which Russia has adopted a staunchly pro-Palestinian position. While accepting a considerable cooling in its relations with Israel, Russia has continued to balance its growing closeness with Iran by also catering to its partnerships with the Gulf Arab states, which are important to its wartime economic survival. Russia’s military presence in the region remains confined to Syria (for now), though it is also eyeing a deep-water port in eastern Libya and other countries of the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Containing Moscow in the region requires a clear-eyed assessment of the opportunities—and associated risks—for Russia in exploiting tensions in the Middle East to harm Western interests. In response to setbacks in Ukraine or increased tensions with the West elsewhere, Russian horizontal escalation in the Middle East in the form of assistance to the Houthis in Yemen or other Iranian partners remains a distinct possibility. With ongoing Iran-Israel tensions, the question of Russia’s military support for Iran has added importance. Though Russia has attempted to position itself as a potential interlocutor between Iran and the West, the intersection of the Ukrainian and Middle Eastern conflicts is likely to reinforce the Moscow-Tehran axis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE “AXIS OF UPHEAVAL”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To recognize the scale of the challenge Russia represents is, first and foremost, to connect the dots of its global foreign policy. An especially urgent task in this regard is understanding the axis of Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran—its internal dynamics, objectives, and limitations. Despite its illiberal, revisionist tendencies, the four-way axis lacks a shared, concrete vision for a future global order; there is limited evidence of trilateral or quadrilateral defense cooperation among the countries to date, and the partners differ in their tolerance for “upheaval”—with China likely being more risk-averse than Russia when it comes to fomenting tensions in the Middle East and the Korean Peninsula. Notwithstanding these limitations, cooperation stands to evolve, with implications for all four countries’ military capabilities, regional conflict dynamics, nuclear proliferation, and their collective potential to fragment the global order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response, Western states need to develop a coherent and joined-up approach both within NATO and the European Union toward the axis, including enhanced coordination on sanctions and in multilateral fora, especially on nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction (WMD) issues. The efforts to undermine the growing alignment among the axis powers may enable Europe to bring the United States on board. These measures should include improved intelligence sharing among allies on axis activities, as well as the use of strategic disclosures to warn of impending technology transfers and deter sensitive cooperation, as was previously applied in the case of Iran and Russia. It should also involve planning for a conflict where more than one of the axis powers is a belligerent. While acknowledging that sanctions and export controls alone will be of limited utility due to the axis’s long history of evading such measures, Western states should still target critical “chokepoint” technologies needed by axis members for drones, missiles, and other sensitive systems. Western capitals should also engage with countries on the axis’s periphery to prevent their closer alignment with it, as well as with countries that have leverage over its members (for instance, Saudi Arabia, India, and others). In addition, there are ways to exacerbate existing tensions between the axis members, including by reinforcing existing differences in their geopolitical interests in the Middle East and Central Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;possible-pitfalls&quot;&gt;Possible Pitfalls&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;underestimating-russia&quot;&gt;Underestimating Russia&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the saying goes, “Russia is never as strong as she looks, nor as weak as she looks.” In the post–Cold War period, several assumptions led the West to repeatedly underestimate Russia’s resilience, newfound assertiveness, and ability to foment international disruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, past policy often dismissed Russia as a “declining power,” overlooking the fact that indicators like the country’s shrinking population and resource-dependent economy had limited short-term impact on Russia’s disruptive capacity. A large, commodity-driven economy can remain viable even when isolated from Western markets, if it prioritizes short-term geopolitical power over long-term economic development. Second, the liberal internationalist belief that economic integration would moderate Russia also proved misguided. Instead of restraining its aggression, the Kremlin used energy revenues to elevate Russia’s global standing and attempted to leverage Europe’s dependence on Russian energy. Far from deterring hostility, joining the institutions like the Financial Action Task Force and Interpol allowed Putin to exploit them to serve Russian interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the belief that Russia would eventually become a “normal” power and a liberal democracy reflected the post–Cold War “end of history” mindset. It made the West downplay Russia’s growing assertiveness: overlooking the 2008 invasion of Georgia, responding weakly to the 2014 annexation of Crimea, and blaming Russia’s aggression on NATO enlargement while underestimating the imperialist roots of its actions. These inadequate responses emboldened the Kremlin. Russia’s renewed assertiveness suggests its brief post-Soviet democratization was an anomaly, driven by the Kremlin’s temporary economic weakness. Without strong civil society, institutional constraints, or a break from imperial identity, post-Soviet Russia preserved much of the Soviet elite and mindset. Once it recovered its material capabilities, it resumed its global ambitions. Given the ideological roots of its aggression, appeasement will be futile, and containment remains the only viable strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;messianic-containment&quot;&gt;“Messianic” Containment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Containment is not a passive strategy. It is compatible with proactive approaches to both the war in Ukraine and to countering the spread of Russian power outside of Europe. At the same time, containment should not be a messianic way of conceptualizing foreign policy, as it sometimes was during the Cold War. In the Cold War, containment often led into strategic cul-de-sacs and foreign policy mistakes outside of Europe—justifying regime change (like in Guatemala and Iran), becoming tainted with paranoia when merged with the domino theory of state collapse and communist takeover (in Vietnam), and generating an overly militarized foreign policy in Africa and the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, containment can be understood as a messianic doctrine, predicated on high defense spending and zero-sum conceptions of global great power competition, and at times aligned with the drive for regime change. It is desirable, however, not to understand containment in this fashion, to be conscious of the potential for strategic overreach, and to be alert to the limitations, an approach that historically and in the present moment has been the foundation for containment’s strategic successes. The proper spirit of containment is patient, resolute, and targeted. Containment is thus compatible with the effort to prioritize that will dominate U.S. foreign policy in Trump’s second term, and an effort that harmonizes with European foreign policy at a time of tight budgets and competing priorities (in both domestic and foreign policies).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-takeaways&quot;&gt;Policy Takeaways&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s resilience and adaptation to the Western countermeasures that have followed its adversarial actions have emboldened the Kremlin, making it double down on its trajectory of intensifying military and hybrid threats to Europe. If the past is prologue, this dynamic will persist as long as Vladimir Putin remains in power, and possibly beyond his rule. Regardless of the outcome of the war in Ukraine, Russia will remain an acute security threat to Europe, the transatlantic alliance, and the liberal international order. The hybrid confrontation between Russia and the West will continue for the foreseeable future, while the risks of conventional confrontation—possibly with a nuclear dimension—will keep rising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, while the Cold War strategy of containment appeared easy to maintain, in reality it was always a struggle. At times, it was too attached to the status quo, too passive, too drab; and at times it shaded into overreach. In the 1970s, many Americans were convinced that the United States was losing the Cold War. They had a hard time seeing a path to victory. Containment’s value as a strategy could only be perceived over time. Kennan acknowledged that Washington had to commit to containment for as long as necessary—until Soviet power had “mellowed” and no longer posed a threat to global stability. Containing Russia in the twenty-first century will require a similar commitment of time and resources. With Europe taking a larger role in devising and implementing containment, it will also require a greater degree of cooperation and unity among the European states, despite their different histories, strategic priorities, and perceptions of the Russia threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;military-and-paramilitary-tools&quot;&gt;Military and Paramilitary Tools&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;UKRAINE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European countries should fully commit to supporting Ukraine militarily and economically. The fate of Ukraine is fundamental to European security and to the success of a containment strategy. Russia’s victory in Ukraine would bring the threat to the European Union’s doorstep. Conversely, if Russia perceives its war in Ukraine to be a strategic dead end, it could be contained to the point of admitting failure. Europe will have to take the lead in bringing about a satisfactory conclusion to the war in Ukraine and to Ukraine’s reconstruction and redevelopment afterward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, Europe’s investment in Ukraine, while significant, has not been sufficient. As a result, Ukraine is currently in an increasingly unfavorable position on the battlefield. Since January 2024, Russia has captured under 5,000 square kilometers of Ukrainian territory—averaging about six per day by April 2025, marking slower but persistent gains that reflect the Kremlin’s continued commitment to the offensive. An effective containment strategy requires further investment into provisions of weapons to Ukraine, and higher levels of defense integration within Europe. With U.S. military support for Ukraine likely to end, in the short term, Europe must ensure Ukraine can keep weakening Russia by purchasing U.S. weapons and coordinating aid with third countries like South Korea and Turkey in order to buy time required to address urgent capability gaps, particularly in munitions and coordination. In the long term, Europe must get serious about building a unified force capable of defending the continent without U.S. support and making military assistance to Ukraine sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CONVENTIONAL MILITARY CAPABILITIES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, Europe should urgently ramp up defense industrial production. The importance of boosting European defense is particularly acute in light of the new U.S. administration’s strategic prioritization of the Indo-Pacific and promises to reduce lethal support to Ukraine. Even as war has raged in Ukraine, European production lines have not yet fully maxed out their capacity. This persistent problem is rooted in the European Union’s failure to coordinate procurements and a chronic lack of defense funding, and urgently needs to be resolved. Through the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG), the United States has coordinated the global effort to aid Ukraine through frequent ad hoc meetings at Ramstein Air Base in Germany. This has helped avoid duplication and focus the assistance efforts of certain countries on particular tasks, such as providing air defense. However, under the Trump administration the United States has transferred leadership to the United Kingdom to convene and coordinate the group, leaving its future uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Europe may have to cope with a United States less engaged at NATO. European militaries should aim to be able to fight together without relying on the United States. Addressing the key capability gaps left by a disengaged United States will not only require more European spending but also—crucially—more European defense cooperation and integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ECONOMIC STATECRAFT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe needs to maintain economic pressure on Russia. Sanctions and lack of access to the global financial system are negatively impacting Russia’s economy and war effort. But Moscow has also been adapting by transitioning to a war economy sustained by vast fossil fuel energy resources, particularly oil, and has found willing customers in Asia. As a result, Russia is unlikely to make major concessions, hoping instead that Western sanctions enforcement and its financial isolation erode over time. Maintaining pressure on Russia economically, and going after its oil revenues in particular, remain crucial to containing and limiting Russia’s current and future military and foreign policy options. Given political sensitivities about energy prices, the European Union should focus on sanctioning Russia’s shadow tanker fleet and otherwise imposing secondary sanctions on third-country firms failing to comply with sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;HYBRID RESILIENCE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European governments should become hypervigilant in calling out and responding to Russian active measures or interference efforts. In the next few years, the Russian hybrid threat to Europe will keep growing, with the Kremlin likely becoming more emboldened through a perceived lack of response in kind. Europe should urgently develop coordinated tools to understand, mitigate, and prevent an inadvertent escalation scenario. This includes further steps to enhance resilience and developing bolder asymmetric responses to Russian actions, such as approving new aid packages for Ukraine, introducing more advanced systems to the battlefield, or deepening diplomatic and economic pressure on China in an effort to limit its support to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;regional-and-global-frames&quot;&gt;Regional and Global Frames&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EASTERN EUROPE, THE SOUTH CAUCASUS, AND CENTRAL ASIA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union and its members should do more to support vulnerable countries in Russia’s vicinity. Europe should backstop security for countries around Russia’s periphery, offering reinforcement to both the eastern flank and “in-between” states. A new containment strategy should emphasize calibrated levels of political and military support to countries that are vulnerable to Russian aggression. With the exception of Belarus, Europe should help ensure these countries’ security and independence through training, arms sales and security assistance, and exercises. It should also focus on building their resilience against Russian hybrid threats via information sharing, law enforcement, intelligence cooperation, and investment in critical infrastructure. Europe’s strategy should further aim to disrupt Russia’s influence by supporting independent media platforms to counter Russia-backed propaganda in the region. An easy step would be to offer more funding for independent journalism to push back on Russian narratives by supporting outlets such as Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Deutsche Welle, and the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Western states should help the Western Balkan countries and Moldova wean themselves off of Russian energy. This would have to be balanced by active diplomatic efforts to prevent further instability in these countries. European partners and the United States could also offer the investments and support mechanisms for Western Balkan arms companies to meet the needs of the Ukrainian army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Containment of Russian power in the South Caucasus requires being realistic about both the region’s challenges and the lack of consensus about its future within Europe. With formal integration remaining far off, the European Union should prioritize keeping the South Caucasus free from domination by regional powers. That approach requires maintaining the existing EU missions in Armenia and Georgia; investing in new infrastructure projects, particularly clean energy; and leveraging the interest of specific allies (e.g., France in Armenia and Turkey in Azerbaijan) to promote common objectives. It also means modernizing EU and NATO partnership arrangements to further promote reform and modernization in line with Western standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Europe and the United States can likely do little to catalyze a rift between Russia and China, they should be prepared in the event of a split to devote resources and attention to Central Asia in order to further pressure the relationship. In the interim, Western powers must remain engaged with the region’s leaders and peoples. They should work with regional leaders and organizations to encourage new investment, especially in projects that promote connectivity away from both Russia and China. They also ought to encourage and promote the role of friendly powers such as India and Turkey to counter any push for a Sino-Russian condominium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CHINA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe may have some ability to soften Beijing’s approach to Russia. But to do so, Europe would have to make containing Russia a priority in its engagement with Beijing, which may come with an economic price. Currently, Europe’s economic relationship has taken precedence in relations with China, especially given the possibility of a transatlantic rift over trade and tariffs. Officials speak of “de-risking” Europe’s economic ties with China, but have been wary of threatening economic actions over China’s immense and vital support to Russia’s defense industry. Europe—especially Germany—will ultimately have to make a choice: If they accept that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine poses an existential risk to Europe and the global order that has facilitated the emergence of EU and European prosperity more generally, they will need to use the substantial economic leverage they have to limit China’s contribution to the Russian war effort. Doing so would require not just European states, but the European Union as a whole to think and act strategically, using its geoeconomic weight to achieve geopolitical goals. Being more assertive toward China would also give Europe more credibility with the Trump administration, which has made checking Chinese power a top priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the longer term, Europe should leverage its trade and investment ties with China to influence Chinese policy toward Russia. While catalyzing a split between Moscow and Beijing is likely not possible, Europe should prioritize reducing Chinese support for Russian imperial ventures against its neighbors. It should also be willing to work with China and its companies on a case-by-case basis to build infrastructure projects—especially in energy and transit—that enhance countries’ resilience in the face of Russian coercion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE GLOBAL SOUTH&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western states face serious constraints when seeking to limit—let alone roll back—Russian advances in Africa. They should try to contain Russia’s current presence and work to prevent its entry in other vulnerable states, including by exposing atrocities committed by the Wagner Group and other Russia-controlled forces on the continent, devising a security cooperation package that is tailored to the needs of African partners while still observant of transatlantic values, and engaging with African partners to develop their energy infrastructure and natural resources in a mutually beneficial way. Europe needs to show that it can deliver for ordinary Africans, whether by promoting improved governance, facilitating trade, or keeping the door to legal migration open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The closing of the U.S. Agency for International Development and the reduced engagement and prioritization of Africa in U.S. foreign policy creates a void that Europe should seek to fill. Yet Europe’s colonial legacy, its intense focus on stopping migration flows, and a lack of firm diplomatic, economic, and military tools through which it can productively engage African states has left European engagement wanting. However, Europe’s institutional complexity can be an advantage; while a colonial legacy may haunt some European countries’ engagement, it may not impact others or the European Union as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Middle East, Russia’s threat lies less in scaling up its military presence and more in using the region for limited horizontal escalation, deepening defense ties with Iran, and undermining Western efforts to reduce conflict. Getting Saudi Arabia to use its leverage with Russia has proven somewhat successful in limiting Russian cooperation with Iran in the past. The fact that Saudi Arabia has continued to hedge on its invite to join the BRICS since 2023 indicates that there may be continued scope to work with Riyadh to curtail Russia, if only on the margins. But Western policymakers should also be cognizant of the reality that as long as the Gaza war and Israel’s campaign against the “axis of resistance” continue, Russia will be able to exploit grievances with Western states in the Middle East (and the broader Global South).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MULTILATERALISM&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To counter Russia’s efforts to chip away at trust in legacy multilateral institutions while boosting the BRICS, Western states should pursue a two-pronged approach: They need to get serious about global governance reform, while also exploiting fissures within the expanded BRICS. The former requires genuine steps toward UN Security Council reform, but also addressing perceived power imbalances in other bodies like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Regarding the latter, important powers like Brazil or India do not see BRICS as an “anti-Western” club. They harbor reservations over the pace and scope of BRICS enlargement, and they pursue complicated foreign policy objectives. Western states should ensure that these countries remain interested in cooperation in the G20, which stands at risk of losing its capacity for collective action and sliding into a setting for East-West and North-South recriminations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;european-frame&quot;&gt;European Frame&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CONTAINMENT AS GOOD FOR EUROPEAN BALANCING&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Containment can unify Europe’s diverse policies on Russia and Ukraine by addressing security fears in Scandinavia, Poland, and the Baltics, while also acknowledging public concerns, especially in Germany, about war costs and escalation. There is the chance to work toward a synthetic European Russia strategy, and this chance could be missed if the policies embraced are either too militaristic or too passive and reactive. Germany is well positioned to shape such a unified policy: Close enough to the conflict to stay engaged, yet able to connect with countries further from the war that are more concerned about escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CONTAINMENT AS A STRATEGY FOR INTEGRATING UKRAINE INTO EUROPE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A viable containment strategy would not defer Ukraine’s integration into Europe. It would not posit Ukraine’s inclusion in European institutions and structures as something that can only happen when the war is over. This will strengthen Ukraine’s resilience and send a clear message to Moscow: The war launched to dominate Ukraine and sever its ties to Europe is backfiring, as Russia’s control over Ukraine steadily erodes. It is not enough to hold the line militarily in Ukraine. Kyiv’s emergence as a member of the European family would be the crowning jewel of a European and transatlantic containment strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;domestic-frame&quot;&gt;Domestic Frame&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European publics demonstrate a wide spectrum of opinion on the war in Ukraine. Containment can work well across the political spectrum by balancing between a more aggressive approach favored by some parties and leaders and a more accommodationist stance preferred by others. In the same way that containment can be used as a tool of policy synthesis within Europe, it can be used as a tool of consensus building. It is not the strategy of any one party or any one group of political parties. It should be approached as the baseline policy of European governments and institutions like the European Commission, to which government coalitions can make their preferred modifications. It is helpful in this context that containment is not a strategic dogma, and it is not zero sum. It is a flexible strategy, which means it can be embraced by many different kinds of political leaders and political parties, and by wide segments of the electorate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Containment” was a defining term of the Cold War, but it’s not essential to today’s strategic messaging and can sometimes be counterproductive due to its Cold War baggage. The word matters less than the concept, and the concept matters less than the story that is being told about the war in Ukraine. This story, crucially, is a story of progress since February 2022. Over the past three plus years, the transatlantic allies and partners have succeeded in containing the spread of Russian political and military power in Ukraine and Europe. The story can be woven into strategic communications at many different points. It can be used to underscore the value of the enterprise—the enterprise of containing Russia more generally. It can point to the future, not downplaying the challenges that lie ahead, but elucidating the supreme value of patience, the many long-term vulnerabilities Russia has, and the prospect, if not of outright victory, of achieving that which is most important for Ukraine and Europe—the preservation of an order based upon the territorial integrity and sovereignty of all European states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 16 July, the Israel Defence Forces launched a series of airstrikes on key sites in Damascus, including the Syrian Ministry of Defence, military headquarters, and areas near the presidential palace. Israel framed the strikes as a warning to the Syrian government against further escalation in Suweida in the south, where clashes erupted between a Druze militia and Bedouin groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to the clashes local to Suweida, the Syrian government had deployed forces to restore order. According to Israeli officials, government forces entered a zone that Israel – currently occupying parts of the area – has designated as demilitarised of heavy weapons. The Israeli Air Force subsequently struck Syrian government targets, framing the strike as enforcement of its red lines and aimed at neutralising militias affiliated with the Syrian government responsible for massacres against the Druze minority in Suweida.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With over 1,200 reported fatalities in a highly volatile escalation, there is a credible risk that such violence could recur. As part of a ceasefire agreement, the Syrian government started evacuating Bedouin families (up to 1,500 persons) trapped inside the city of Suweida. The UN International Organization for Migration reported that close to 130,000 people were displaced in the hostilities. Syria’s President Ahmed al-Sharaa has vowed to protect Syria’s Druze and condemned external intervention aimed at fracturing Syria’s national unity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-fragility-of-the-post-assad-transition&quot;&gt;The Fragility of the Post-Assad Transition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) emerged as the dominant force in the fragile new state that replaced the Assad regime, it has yet been unable to sideline other armed, former Jihadist factions with which it had previously collaborated during the anti-regime conflict. The challenges facing the interim Syrian government led by al-Sharaa are formidable: the task of constructing institutional capacity after decades of tyrannical dynastic Assad rule; managing acute financial constraints within a heavily internationally sanctioned economy; and contending with a critical shortage of trained civil administrators and professional security forces. Yet despite these obstacles, the central test confronting Syria’s new governing power has remained constant since December 2024: asserting effective and uncontested political and military authority across the entirety of Syria’s national territory and its borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three key regions of Syria managed to carve out quasi semi-autonomous spheres beyond the reach of centralised authority during the multisided civil war and the tumultuous years before Assad’s fall. These regions include: the northeast, governed by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF); Suweida, with its Druze-majority population; and Deraa, which developed a distinct and negotiated relationship with the Assad regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent deadly violence marks the culmination of months of mounting local grievances compounded by inadequate or poorly conceived policies from the central government to respond to local demands for decentralisation in Druze-dominated areas. Recent violence erupted after a young Druze vendor from Suweida was reported to be forcibly stopped and kidnapped on 11 July at a makeshift Bedouin checkpoint on the highway between the province and Damascus. The Druze contend that the Syrian government has allowed the security situation in Suweida to deteriorate intentionally, as part of a broader strategy to reassert full control over the province. Hikmat al-Hijri, the dominant, yet polarising, leader of Syria’s Druze, has been a central figure in the recent violence, accused of endorsing Israel’s intervention on behalf of the Druze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Damascus, the loss of authority in one region could set a legitimacy-testing and undermining precedent, encouraging similar challenges elsewhere in the already fragmented state. Its inability to assert control in Suwayda not only undermines its image as a sovereign central power but also risks emboldening restive constituencies in Latakia, Hasakah, and even in Aleppo – turning isolated defiance into a contagion of fragmentation. For al-Sharaa, the stakes are therefore not just local – they are existential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all Druze factions have been irreversibly opposed to the interim government in Damascus, but a sizeable portion have sought accommodation on their own terms. Demands for special arrangements for the region began in January: Druze armed groups formed in Suweida refused to disarm and community elders insisted that government officials in the province were selected from among local residents. They reluctantly accepted the appointment of Mustafa Bakkour as governor, and only under pressure. Bakkour ultimately resigned in May due to sustained unrest. Until the final week of June, administrative oversight of Suweida was temporarily handled by an official from neighbouring Deraa province. Frequent demonstrations have signalled local rejection of government-affiliated security forces operating in the area. In the lead-up to the recent flare-up, tensions remained high – underscoring the persistent fractures between the centre and periphery and exposing the limits of Damascus’s ability to assert a monopoly on the use of force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-south-as-precedent-for-the-northeast&quot;&gt;The South as Precedent for the Northeast&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel has consistently emphasised two red lines regarding Syria: preventing the Syrian military from deploying south of Damascus and protecting the Druze population. These priorities have effectively positioned Israel as a central actor in what might otherwise appear to be a localised internal conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israeli policymakers are well aware that if the al-Sharaa government fails to establish control in Suwayda, it could significantly weaken Damascus’ posture – particularly in relation to the Kurds in the northeast. In that sense, Suwayda is not just a provincial contest; it is a strategic fault line with broader implications for Syria’s internal balance and Israel’s regional deterrence architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) is not a monolithic entity; it comprises a patchwork of Arab tribal factions that joined the coalition at different points to fight against Islamic State (Daesh) and, in some cases, to oppose the Assad regime following the outbreak of Syria’s multisided civil war in 2011. However, the Kurdish-Arab tribal consensus has been under strain, especially in non-Kurdish majority areas. Now, government failure in the south risks exposing the hollow core of post-war Assad rule and reinforces the image of a fragmented Syria. This raises the risk that the Syrian Kurdish narrative – namely, that Damascus lacks the capacity to govern the entirety of Syria – may gain further traction. However, to date, the SDF have shown no signs of intent to disrupt the ongoing, historically significant disarmament process involving the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) in Iraq and Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;israel-us-tensions&quot;&gt;Israel-US Tensions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel’s strikes in Suweida and Damascus have resuscitated speculation that there is daylight between US President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu. Such noise had subsided after what appeared to be a turning point following US strikes against three Iranian nuclear sites in the aftermath of Israel’s operation “Rising Lion”. Now, the flareup in Syria seems to have widened the gap between Trump and Israel’s ruling government over both strategy and timing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crystalising signs of the divergence, US Envoy for Syria and Ambassador to Turkey Tom Barrack said, “The United States was not asked, nor did they participate in that decision, nor was it the United States responsibility in matters that Israel feels is for its own self-defence.” He added, Israel’s intervention “creates another very confusing chapter” and “came at a very bad time.” In a rare critique of Israeli policy, the news site Axios quoted several US officials as being critical of Netanyahu, with one unnamed White House official as saying, “Bibi acted like a madman. He bombs everything all the time . . . This could undermine what Trump is trying to do.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel’s stated rationale for its latest strikes in Syria blends claims of self-defence with a purported commitment to protecting the Druze minority. Israeli officials insist they will not allow hostile actors to establish a foothold along Israel’s northern frontier and have unilaterally demanded the demilitarisation of areas south of Damascus. The effect of this is that the Syrian government must effectively relinquish its sovereign right over its own territory, ceding sovereign rights to its territory and the airspace above it to Israel. This, despite a series of consistent signs from Syrian interim president Al-Sharaa that Damascus is not interested in hostilities with Isreal, even going as far as to indicate the possibility of a non-aggression agreement brokered by the US in recent weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public criticism by Barrack is likely meant to send a warning to Netanyahu that the White House is growing impatient with military action that runs counter to Trump’s vision for a centralised and “back-to-business” Syria. In recent days, the UK and 27 states jointly issued a statement against “drip feeding of aid and the inhumane killing of civilians” in Gaza. Israel’s actions in Syria have risked alienating Israel further. In a notable show of regional solidarity, Turkey and ten Arab states issued a joint declaration on 17 July condemning the strikes as violations of Syrian sovereignty. They reaffirmed support for Syria’s unity and territorial integrity, rejected foreign interference, and welcomed the ceasefire between the Syrian government and Druze militias in Suweida.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;post-ceasefire-realities-and-constraints&quot;&gt;Post-ceasefire Realities and Constraints&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fragile ceasefire in Suweida is holding, for now. But what will this deadly chapter of the post-Assad transition, the failure of Al-Sharaa’s forces to prevent violence against Druze civilians and the local Sunni Arab population, mean for US support for the man that Trump described as a “young, attractive guy. Tough guy. Strong past.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three key conclusions can be drawn from the recent conflict. The first is the sheer difficulty Damascus faces in asserting authority across the entirety of Syrian territory. Countering Hikmat al-Hijri and his group – comprising only a few thousand armed fighters – should have been a straightforward task for the al-Sharaa government. Yet, Damascus has demonstrated a weak hand in projecting and sustaining control, particularly when it ignores local power dynamics and communal grievances. The Druze have been a persecuted minority for a long and fraught history. Al-Sharaa inherited this problem; he did not create it. However, his interim government could have done more to foster national consensus around the new governance framework, pairing calls for militia integration with genuine efforts at political inclusion. His forces – already under-resourced and lacking in cohesion – appear to have overreached by attempting to reassert control over Suweida through pro-government tribal militias, without adequately addressing the province’s specific grievances or its expectations from the post-Assad order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second, and related, lesson is the risk that violence can erupt elsewhere in Syria should Damascus try to forcefully gain territorial control in fragmented areas by mobilising armed Arab tribal factions in lieu of negotiated agreements with local communities to promote integration with the Syrian state. Should the attempted uprising that occurred between Latakia and Tartus in March be repeated, for example, the Syrian government may face a renewed challenge to its force projection across volatile intra-communal and cross-regional fault lines inside Syria. It is worth bearing in mind that it was not only regime forces that were compelled to withdraw from Suweida: Arab tribal militias – many of whom had deployed thousands of fighters to the area to support the regime or avenge killed kin – were also forced to pull back in the ceasefire agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being at a structural disadvantage, the Druze managed to expel both state forces and their tribal allies from Suweida. This outcome is likely to have been noted by other actors in comparable circumstances and may well influence future challenges to Damascus’ authority. The most consequential issue on the horizon is the question of how, whether and under what terms the SDF will integrate with Syrian Ministry of Defence forces, and how this will impact the balance of power in northeastern Syria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is clear is that Damascus needs to urgently build up a professional and centralised security force with a recognisable command and control structure and effective deployment capabilities. The current approach that relies on regional armed group integration is slow and contingent on shifting militia interests and loyalties. Even more concerning than the challenge of security sector reform (SSR) and force institutionalisation is the possible emergence of an alternative armed movement – formed outside the control of the state – consisting of thousands of tribal fighters mobilised under the banner of restoring stability or exacting revenge. ;Moreover, some leaders of Sunni Arab tribal factions have openly declared that the ceasefire applies to the government – not to them – highlighting the fragmented nature of authority on the ground. Complicating matters further, although the tribal council claims to represent southern tribes, there is credible evidence that the clashes have also drawn in tribal fighters from Deir ez-Zor, Hama, Idlib, and Aleppo, as well as a number of foreign-trained militants with a history of involvement in intra-communal conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third conclusion drawn from this conflict is that should al-Sharaa’s government delay in a process of accountability to deliver justice in the aftermath of the atrocities that were committed in Suweida by all sides. This requires public procedures against those affiliated with Sheik Hijri as well as pro-government militia and rebel factions drawn from ex-Jihadi fighters (including some foreigners) to investigate killings, torture and kidnappings that are reported to have taken place. There needs to be a swift, credible and transparent investigation and the perpetrators held to account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brief but deadly bout of fighting resolved none of the underlying triggers that drove the escalation. On the contrary, both Druze forces and Sunni Arab tribal fighters employed severe violence against one another, deepening inter-communal animosity and heightening minority insecurities. With memories of the massacre in Latakia still fresh, the reciprocal abuses reported in Suweida are magnifying fear across communities – and rising fear is delaying disarmament. Taken together, these dynamics suggest that another round of violence in Syria – beginning in Suweida but potentially spreading more widely – may not be far off. It is conceivable that in the coming months we may witness a series of new clashes – possibly extending into Deir ez-Zor and Raqqa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between January and March 2025, the United States indicted or sanctioned individuals and companies linked to Chinese state-sponsored threat actors known as APT27, Red Hotel, and Flax Typhoon – labels used by cybersecurity researchers to group entities with similar tactics. Many of the individuals behind these groups trace their roots to an earlier community of elite hackers known as “red hackers” or “Honkers”, active in online forums during the mid-1990s and 2000s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the following two decades, these Honkers evolved from informal hacker collectives into key architects of China’s cyber apparatus. Many founded security startups, helped build cybersecurity teams at major tech firms such as Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, and Huawei and helped shape a cybersecurity market driven by attack-defence capabilities. Today, these capabilities likely serve as key enablers of China’s advanced persistent threat (APT) groups, as cyber operations are increasingly carried out through private-sector proxies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6CRVHmT.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ From Grassroots Hacktivism to the Professionalisation of Red Hacker Groups.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent report by the Cyber Defense Project at the Center for Security Studies (CSS) at ETH Zurich titled “Before Vegas: The ‘Red Hackers’ Who Shaped China’s Cyber Ecosystem,” charts this evolution. It focuses on 40 influential figures – referred to as “The Red 40” – and traces how informal talent was gradually absorbed into a tightly integrated ecosystem: one where informal networks, private enterprise, and state interests intersect through a mix of grassroots experimentation, strategic alignment, and increasing institutional control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-making-of-the-red-40&quot;&gt;The Making of the Red 40&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Red 40 came of age during China’s early internet era. After China connected to the global internet in 1994, universities became key hubs for connectivity and experimentation, helping foster hacker culture before widespread internet access. By the late 1990s, red hacker groups began to emerge, driven by nationalism, technical curiosity, and rising geopolitical tensions. Groups like the Honker Union, Green Army, and China Eagle Union gained prominence during a wave of “cyber wars” between 1998 and 2001 – targeting foreign entities perceived as hostile to China, including the US, Taiwan and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These operations were both offensive and defensive, offering hands-on experience in real-world conditions at a time when China’s cybersecurity ecosystem was still in its infancy and formal training pathways were limited. Universities offered few dedicated programs, and mechanisms like Capture the Flag competitions (competitions are simulated cybersecurity challenges where participants apply offensive and defensive skills – such as exploiting vulnerabilities, reverse engineering, or cryptography—to solve problems and retrieve hidden “flags” for points) or bug bounty platforms (structured initiatives where organizations invite security researchers to identify and responsibly disclose vulnerabilities in their systems, offering financial rewards for valid findings) remained nascent throughout the 2000s, only gaining traction in the early 2010s. Red hacker groups filled this gap. Self-organized and technically rigorous, they developed skills through trial-and-error – often by probing real-world targets, driven by the belief that mastering offensive techniques is essential for effective defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/7MlXlfo.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ The Red 40.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While groups like the Honker Union and Green Army attracted thousands of users, it was their inner circles that drove real technical innovation and gave rise to the Red 40. These 40 technically advanced individuals played a central role in laying the foundations of China’s domestic cybersecurity industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;building-the-industry&quot;&gt;Building the Industry&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the late 2000s, an increasing number of prominent red hacker groups fractured under growing pressure. Internally, many faced leadership disputes, diverging goals, and an aging member base. As one former Honker Union member put it, “Above all, most of us who were students had to find practical things to do after our graduation.” Externally, the government had become increasingly wary of hacking group activities. The 2009 Criminal Law Amendment VII criminalized unauthorized intrusions and the distribution of hacking tools, leading to arrests and online forum closures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the same period, China’s information and communications technology (ICT) sector was undergoing rapid growth, driven by telecom expansion, rising internet penetration, and the rise of major tech firms. This environment attracted many Red 40 hackers. Some founded cybersecurity start-ups, such as NSFOCUS and Knownsec, while others joined established cybersecurity firms such as Venustech and Topsec or helped build cybersecurity teams at Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent and Huawei.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet despite this growth, the cybersecurity industry remained underdeveloped. As Chinese tech outlet PingWest noted, “before 2010, cybersecurity had not received the attention it deserved from any perspective.” The 2013 Snowden leaks marked a turning point. They confirmed long-standing fears of US surveillance and accelerated a national push to strengthen China’s cyber capabilities. Investment surged and regulatory frameworks were overhauled, boosting economic incentives by a lot. In this context, Red 40 led the transition into a new era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/PqFtyVo.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Trajectories of the Red 40.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the mid-2010s, companies founded by Red 40 members, such as NSFOCUS and Knownsec, had become national leaders. Some Red 40 figures went on to lead cloud security efforts at major tech firms like Alibaba, Tencent and Huawei. Others launched startups in emerging fields such as APT tracking and cybercrime intelligence. Labs such as Tencent’s Keen Lab and Xuanwu Lab, led by Red 40 members, gained global recognition in vulnerability research through elite hacking competitions and bug bounty platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;embedding-into-state-operations&quot;&gt;Embedding into State Operations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As China’s cybersecurity industry matured in the 2010s, so did its ecosystem of highly sophisticated and persistent state-sponsored cyber actors, increasingly built around private-sector proxies. Parallel to their contributions to the private sector, Red 40 members have also become key figures in China’s state-sponsored cyber operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figures such as Tan Dailin (wicked rose), Zeng Xiaoyong (envymask), and Zhou Shuai (coldface) transitioned from online forums to front companies conducting cyberespionage for government security agencies, becoming central actors in groups such as APT41, APT17, and APT27. From January to March 2025, not only front companies but also established firms led by Red 40 members have been linked to state-sponsored operations. Among them are i-SOON—led by Wu Haibo (shutdown) and Chen Cheng (lengmo) – and Integrity Tech, headed by Cai Jingjing (cbird).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These firms, which have associated with threat actors Aquatic Panda and Flax Typhoon –reportedly responsible for compromising victims within a wide range of industries globally – place a strong emphasis on commercial cybersecurity training. This distinction is important: unlike front companies, which often have minimal commercial activity and serve primarily as operational cover, real businesses are profit-driven, scalable and embedded in the broader cybersecurity sector. For instance, Integrity Tech leads China’s cybersecurity training market with a 20.4% share. Leveraging such firms enables more persistent, better-resourced and more innovative cyber capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9ljqeTs.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Red 40 networks and tool sharing in Chinese APT ecosystem.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, many of the Red 40 members involved in state-sponsored operations were personally acquainted and maintained long-standing professional and informal networks that helped shape how talent and tools are shared across China’s APT groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;from-the-red-40-to-the-next-generation&quot;&gt;From The Red 40 to the Next Generation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Red 40 laid the foundation for what has since evolved into a structured and institutionalized cyber ecosystem, anchored by an industry increasingly driven by innovation in attack-defence capabilities. Unlike earlier generations who came of age reading hacker magazines and teaching themselves online, the country’s cyber workforce is now shaped by hacking competitions, specialized university programs, and attack-defence exercises. Today, companies rooted in capture the flag culture are regarded as a primary engine of innovation, offering offensive and defensive services like red teaming, penetration testing and threat intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Old school vs. new school commentary 22/07/25.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Founders like Chen Peiwen (Boundary Unlimited), Kevin Shen (Yunqi Wuyin), and Shu Junliang (Feiyu Security) led top university CTF teams before launching startups built on offensive capabilities. Their firms focus on fuzzing, application security, and secure software development – fields where offensive skills offer a strategic edge. Others, such as Zhang Ruidong (NoSugar) and Yang Changcheng (Zhongan Netstar), apply similar techniques to fraud detection and law enforcement support. As this ecosystem grows, it likely plays an increasingly central role in enabling China’s APT activity, given the state’s growing use of private-sector actors to conduct cyber operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of China’s red hackers is a case study in how informal cyber communities, given the right incentives – can evolve into core enablers of state capability. The Red 40 didn’t merely staff China’s cybersecurity ecosystem; they shaped it from the ground up. As other nations consider how to cultivate cyber talent and strengthen public-private partnerships, China’s experience offers a powerful lesson: what begins in anonymous forums can end in boardrooms and on digital battlefields. Ignoring this emerging civilian talent comes with strategic risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the last decade, the United States has maintained that it is a “Pacific power,” and multiple administrations have affirmed the importance of the vast Pacific Islands region to U.S. national security. Increased engagement with the Pacific, which began under the first Trump administration, has broad bipartisan support as a security priority. As the first 100 days of the second Trump administration drew to an end, rhetoric coming out of the administration echoed this trend, with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth visiting Guam and Hawaii on his first trip to the Indo-Pacific, during which he stressed the critical nature of Pacific U.S. territories at the “tip of America’s spear” of deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Pacific leaders have consistently stated that they look to actions, and not just words, as proof of a nation’s commitments. Here, recent cuts to the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the pausing of U.S. foreign assistance, enacting tariffs on small and vulnerable island economies, and deprioritizing climate change—the top priority for the region—have had a decidedly negative impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of U.S. intent, the perception across the Pacific of the United States as a disinterested and mercurial partner undercuts the country’s ability to build meaningful and lasting partnerships in the Pacific and simultaneously opens space for China to displace U.S. influence and presence in this critical region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a region that has quietly become a stage for great power competition, this perception of U.S. disinterest not only opens new entry points for Beijing’s influence but also puts wind in the sails of a new narrative: that it is China, not the United States, that is the committed partner and protector of global rules and norms. While it is too soon to understand the full implications of the United States’ recent actions, early signs in the Pacific suggest that the trajectory is counter to U.S. interests. Reversing this trend will require quick action, sincere engagement, and creative diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-emerging-stage-for-great-power-competition&quot;&gt;An Emerging Stage for Great Power Competition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has long engaged with the Pacific Islands region for trade, access to Asia, and security purposes. While U.S. engagement in the Pacific was arguably deepest during World War II—a period that proved without a doubt the strategic importance of the region—U.S. engagement both predates that war and has persisted since. Building and maintaining strong relationships with the many nations that make up this broad swath of the globe has always been in the national interest of the United States, but maintaining this hard-fought presence and influence requires demonstrating the value of such a partnership. Yet, in the post–World War II era, Washington’s attention to the region was periodic at best—and dominated primarily by defense and security agreements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1twNeuQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Islands in the Pacific Ocean&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last decade, China has increased both its interest in and its capacity to deepen relationships across what it views as a highly strategic region—one in which a permanent Chinese presence would significantly alter the U.S. and allied strategic calculus. Largely in response, the United States began to ramp up its Pacific engagement under the first Trump administration with the hosting of three Pacific leaders at the White House and the establishment of a team to renegotiate the Compacts of Free Association (COFA) with the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), and the Republic of Palau. The agreement has direct security benefits for the United States as it allows for unilateral U.S. defense access across the north Pacific, from the Philippines to Hawaii. The Biden administration accelerated this trend, twice hosting the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) leaders for a summit at the White House, launching the first-ever U.S. government strategy for the Pacific Islands, opening several new embassies, increasing USAID presence across the Pacific, and completing the critical COFA agreements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An overarching characteristic of this reengagement was relationship building, demonstrating a growing appreciation in Washington for the importance the Pacific places on consensus, mutual respect, and dialogue—also called the “Pacific Way.” But building and maintaining relationships—a prerequisite for influence—requires not just sincere engagement, but also follow-through. As 2024 ended, several commitments from the recent U.S.-PIF summits were incomplete, and 2024 concluded with many Pacific nations still skeptical that the United States was truly back as a committed partner—and still questioning the value of U.S. engagement versus that of an ever-present and willing China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;soft-power-in-the-service-of-hard-power&quot;&gt;Soft Power in the Service of Hard Power&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the United States has never been the largest donor in the Pacific, it has become increasingly clear in recent years that meeting the region’s needs while effectively countering China’s influence requires coordinated and sustained efforts by all likeminded allies and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States was the fifth-largest aid provider to the Pacific between 2008 and 2022, behind Australia, China, Japan, and New Zealand, according to the Lowy Institute’s Pacific Aid Map. In that period, the United States spent $3.4 billion and committed $4.4 billion to the region, although much of this was through the COFA agreements. Beyond COFA, U.S. assistance has been a more limited, but still critical, component of funding to the vulnerable region. For example, in 2022, the Solomon Islands received the most of any non-COFA country from the United States at $24.6 million, but that was still dwarfed by Australia’s $116 million and China’s $40 million spent in the Solomon Islands that same year. In 2023, outside of COFA funds, the United States provided $57.6 million in development assistance to the region. This money went toward a range of areas, including supporting education, infrastructure, climate initiatives, disaster response, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/3uqrC6Z.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Top Foreign Aid Donors to the Pacific&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, USAID has been the primary implementer of U.S. foreign assistance programs, but select programs are also executed by the U.S. Department of State. For example, in 2014, the department implemented roughly $4.4 billion of the total $12 billion allocated for economic assistance (USAID implemented $5.4 billion). On 30 June, USAID as an independent agency was officially shuttered. Responsibility for USAID-related development now falls under the Department of State; however, the Trump administration plans to cut 90 percent of USAID programs, and currently almost all USAID and State Department foreign assistance programming has been indefinitely paused pending a full review (the initial 90-day review deadline has been pushed back twice). Cutting 90 percent of projects will entail eliminating 5,800 out of 6,200 multi-year USAID contract awards globally, resulting in a $54 billion reduction, along with cutting 4,100 out of 9,100 State Department grants globally, leading to a $4.4 billion decrease in programmatic funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Programs with a climate change nexus—considered a top national security threat for the Pacific Islands—are most likely to be axed. For example, a $2.5 million grant for the Pacific Islands Ambassador Self-Help Small Grants Program, which included tackling climate change, has already been terminated, as was a $905,487 grant to support the Pacific Islands Emergency Management Alliance. Taken in combination with the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, U.S. credibility as a global leader on a climate change or clean energy has been significantly undercut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the extent to which USAID programming was a central part of U.S. engagement in the Pacific, small island nations have been hit particularly hard by these pauses and cuts. While specific figures on the amount of funding cuts per region are not available, the overall effects to the Pacific are significant. According to the Center for Global Development, these cuts amount to 100 percent of USAID country programming for Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, Palau, Fiji, and the Solomon Islands. Even in the Compact states, some critical funding lies outside of COFA and has been affected. For example, the Palau Red Cross Society has cited the loss of nearly $600,000 in humanitarian aid due to USAID cuts. As one local project manager in Papua New Guinea stated shortly after the initial announcement in late January, the team was “devastated” by the freeze of HIV and health related projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/OEqgxZu.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: USAID Cuts to Select Pacific Island Countries&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effects are not limited to recipient countries: Fellow donor partners and allies are affected as well. Countries such as Australia, which has a deep appreciation of the importance of development assistance to its own national security, are racing to assess the extent of the fallout and recalibrate their own work in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The logic behind these changes is that U.S. foreign assistance spending should be in support of U.S. national security objectives. That premise, in and of itself, is not flawed. However, the method of first fully halting and then proceeding with a full review not only deprived partners of valued programming—with some particularly harmful results—but also fed into the narrative of the United States as a fickle, unreliable partner. Such measures weaken, not bolster, U.S. national security by diluting U.S. presence, influence, and relationships around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tariffs-the-one-two-punch&quot;&gt;Tariffs: The One-Two Punch&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While halting the majority of USAID and State Department foreign assistance programs will no doubt have a larger tangible effect on the everyday lives of Pacific Islanders, the “Liberation Day” tariff announcements also caused shock and confusion in a region that has long looked to the United States as global economic leader with which countries sought closer trade ties. The high rates on these small and often struggling economies—where in some islands over 25 percent of the population lives below the poverty line (see Figure 4)—appeared disconnected with both reality and common sense. The United States has a trade surplus with all but two of the Pacific Islands—Fiji ($208 million trade deficit) and Tuvalu ($168,000 trade deficit), the latter of which has a population of around 11,000—and yet almost none escaped liberation day unscathed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/RzUuuAg.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: Tariff Rate Placed on the Pacific Island Countries by the United States&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government has framed these tariffs as both an attempt to level the playing field and as a tool for negotiation. Neither of these justifications makes sense for the Pacific. As small island states with limited markets and opportunities, trade plays an outsized role in bolstering small economies—and yet, overall, U.S.-Pacific trade is almost insignificant on the U.S. ledger. U.S. two-way trade with the Pacific Islands totals around $1 billion, just a small fraction of the more than $7 trillion in global trade conducted by the United States. In other words, there is no “leveling of the playing field” between, for instance, Tuvalu and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/fBcExML.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 3: Total Trade Volume Between the United States and Select Partner Countries&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither does the idea that tariffs are a bargaining chip with the Pacific hold strategic logic. Not only do Pacific countries have little to bargain with, but after the imposition of tariffs, it remains unclear what benefit they would accrue from entering such negotiations. Even factoring in ramped-up U.S. engagement in recent years, the United States remains far behind other countries in terms of what it contributes to the region (see Figure 1), a point which is further underscored by Washington’s exiting from the Paris Agreement and shuttering of most of its development assistance programming. Rather than offering limited inducements, many of these pragmatic countries will increasingly look to other partners and markets. As Fijian Prime Minister Rabuka recently stated, “The world is bigger than the United States. . . . We don’t have anything to counter with so we will have to weather the storm and roll with the punches.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rBsUawU.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications-for-us-national-security&quot;&gt;Implications for U.S. National Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. engagement with the Pacific has never simply been blind support for partners and allies, nor even solely of bolstering these small democratic states. It has always had a strong strategic rationale, and that is as true now as it was in World War II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet U.S. actions are not just leaving space for China to fill. They are also elevating the narrative of China as a responsible, predictable global partner. As the United States eliminates every argument for the Pacific to look to it over China, Beijing has ramped up its carrot-and-stick diplomacy throughout the region. In a side-by-side comparison, the United States was already less present and offering less than China by almost every metric. There had, however, remained in the Pacific a persistent discomfort with the manner of China’s engagement, with the sense that, ultimately, Chinese interest, at the expense of the Pacific, would always win out. But as the United States reduces programming in the region and China demonstrates its ability to evolve into a reliable partner, this narrative is shifting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing has been quick to capitalize on negative perceptions of Washington and amplify its own messaging of China as the great global stabilizer. Shortly after the global U.S. tariffs were announced, China’s ambassador to Papua New Guinea, Yang Xiaoguang, called U.S. tariffs “economic bullying” and emphasized that China, as Papua New Guinea’s “most reliable partner,” would remain consistent and open to trade with the island nation. That same week, China’s ambassador to Fiji reinforced the same message, emphasizing that China remained committed to enhancing trade and investment ties with Fiji, despite external trade and tariff tensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has been focusing much of its Pacific ramp-up on Fiji. Total two-way trade between Fiji and China increased from just $145.2 million in 2010 to $532.2 million in 2023, and in 2024 the two agreed to a $300 million infrastructure development project through the Belt and Road Initiative to construct 22 bridges and improve roads on Vanua Levu. China announced in April 2025 that it would establish direct flights between Shanghai and Nadi, Fiji. In making the announcement, Chinese ambassador to Fiji Zhou Jian noted that the U.S. trade war could present an opportunity for enhancing China’s trade with Fiji. The subtext, of course, is that China is ready and willing to strengthen engagement across a range of sectors in contrast to perceived U.S. withdrawal. Further reinforcing this message, in late May 2025, China hosted the third China-Pacific Island Countries Foreign Ministers’ Meeting in Xiamen, Fujian Province, bringing together senior officials from 11 Pacific Island countries. At this meeting—the first time the Pacific Foreign Ministers have gathered in China—China announced plans to launch over 100 climate-related projects for the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a Republican professional staff member of the U.S. House Committee on Armed Services said at an April 2025 committee hearing on military posture and national security challenges in the Indo-Pacific, “we have built very strong relationships…and this has been the greatest thing that has really frustrated China, it’s now surrounded by a group of nations that don’t want to be bullied by China, so they’re looking to us for support . . . and now we are trying to out bully China . . . and show [our partners] that we can punch them just as hard as China can punch them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drivers behind this multifaceted push by China are clear. For Beijing, the Pacific presents an exceptionally low-cost, high-yield opportunity. For relatively small monetary commitments, China can pursue major strategic, diplomatic, and economic gains. Strategically, Chinese activity in the Pacific has the dual benefit of pursuing its own potential foothold while forcing the United States, Australia, and others to block Chinese influence everywhere at once. Some have likened this to a game of whack-a-mole, where the United States along with other likeminded countries must work to maintain presence everywhere, whereas China only needs to find one security foothold to drastically alter the calculus of its adversaries. Whatever the game is called, it is clear that it is being played to Beijing’s advantage. And with the United States looking like it might be stepping away from the region, the cost-benefit calculus for China just became that much more compelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Pacific, where relationships are the currency of influence, the perception of the United States as a disinterested partner is steadily increasing. Making up this perception gap will require careful diplomacy—and real action—that is aimed at the Pacific, instead of relegating the region to collateral damage in sweeping executive orders. To ensure it does not lose further ground in this critical arena, the United States should embrace the opportunity to emphasize its commitment to the region through the following actions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embrace the use of soft power for hard objectives.&lt;/strong&gt; As the Department of State completes its review of foreign assistance, it should ensure that proper weight is placed on the importance of aligning with Pacific priorities, as that is the most effective way to build and maintain these critical relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The business-minded, transactional approach to international relations risks promoting a zero-sum mentality, which hampers effective diplomacy by deprioritizing the significant gains that can be made through relationship building. Framing an effective strategy for the Pacific region must, as with all national strategies, be aimed at protecting U.S. national security interests. However, creating a national-security centered strategy and working with Pacific partners to meet their critical health, infrastructure, and maritime security are not mutually exclusive—in fact, doing the latter directly bolsters the effectiveness of the former.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As one senior U.S. official put it to the authors, much of America’s engagement constitutes “soft power in the service of hard power,” and is a recognition that building trust and relationships in the Pacific is ultimately tied to broader strategic goals.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize follow-through on existing commitments.&lt;/strong&gt; Even as the Pacific waits for the Trump administration to finish its review of foreign assistance, concern remains that other agreements—even those already funded by Congress—may be in peril. Ensuring full and proper implementation of the COFA agreements and the much heralded Tuna Treaty will be critical as both are viewed as baselines of U.S. commitment to the region. Additionally, attention should be given to following through on promises made, such as opening new embassies in Tonga, the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and Kiribati—the first three of which have been officially opened but still lack a resident ambassador. This may be a tough sell amid a State Department push to reduce diplomatic presence globally, but in a region where China has more outposts than the United States and Chinese diplomats often outnumber U.S. ones by 10 to 1, it must remain a top priority for the department.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promote a realistic trade agenda.&lt;/strong&gt; Even outside of back-and-forth tariffs, there are other ways the United States can help bolster Pacific economic growth. Despite having small and somewhat narrow economies, Pacific nations possess niche markets and business opportunities. Yet, most Pacific embassies in the United States are too small to host economic councilors or trade attaches. Supporting the establishment of a Pacific trade representative in the United States—perhaps in multiple locations such as Washington, D.C., and San Francisco, California—would not only allow Pacific countries to have a central node through which to engage economically with the United States, but would also allow U.S. businesses access to valuable markets and opportunities abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;To further enable U.S. industrial engagement in the Pacific, the U.S. government should reauthorize and reconfigure the Development Finance Corporation (DFC) to be better fit-for-purpose to meet its strategic mandates. Allowing the DFC to work in middle income countries, for example, and streamlining processes for working with state-owned companies would go a long way toward bolstering the U.S. toolkit as it looks for ways to counter massive Chinese inroads in the economic and infrastructure space in the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pursue new opportunities based on administration priorities.&lt;/strong&gt; Some Trump administration priorities are well aligned with Pacific concerns and provide the opportunity for specialized and welcome engagement. Drug trafficking, a top priority for the Trump administration, is a growing threat in the Pacific and is poised to quickly overwhelm small and fragile Pacific communities and governments. With its vast law enforcement and transnational crime assets, the United States is well positioned to provide training and assistance on an issue of top concern to all countries involved.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Relatedly, problems such as drug trafficking are amplified by the immense challenge Pacific Islands have in monitoring their vast maritime domains. Collectively, the Pacific Islands’ exclusive economic zones are over a third bigger than that of the United States, even though their collective land mass is just a fraction of the United States’. Using foreign assistance programming to bolster Pacific security professionals and architecture and leveraging exceptional assets such as the U.S. Coast Guard to bolster Pacific maritime domain awareness has the dual benefit of meeting U.S. and Pacific security needs and further displacing China from entering the security sector across the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capitalize on interest from partners and allies.&lt;/strong&gt; U.S. policymakers have long understood that the United States cannot go it alone in the Pacific. The region is too vast, the challenges too broad, and U.S. attention is often needed elsewhere. At the same time, more and more partners around the world see the Pacific Islands region as one that directly affects their own strategic interests. In its effort to have partners and allies do more for their own security, this interest should be welcomed and encouraged. Bolstering work through multilateral groupings not only coordinates and spread loads resources, it maximizes each partners’ strengths in the service of collective objectives. The Quad is particularly suited for working in the Pacific, given its focus on health, infrastructure, and connectivity, all top priorities for Pacific nations. Following through on the Quad Indo-Pacific Maritime Domain Awareness initiative, which has a particular work stream aimed at bolstering Pacific nations’ ability to monitor their vast maritime domains, would be an excellent way to meet both Pacific and U.S. security priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The trilateral U.S.-Australia-Japan partnership has had success targeting critical infrastructure projects such as financing the East Micronesia Cable. This grouping should double down on these efforts by pinpointing and pursuing strategically critical infrastructure projects such as ports, airfields and roads, where China is already making significant inroads.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take action at the congressional level.&lt;/strong&gt; The importance of the Pacific Islands region remains an area of strong bipartisan agreement in Washington, as demonstrated when the Congress succeeded in passing COFA funding legislation in the spring of 2024, even during a highly partisan election season. As the Trump administration continues to craft its strategy for the Indo-Pacific, the time is ripe for Congress to signal its priorities to the administration and move forward with legislation that protects remaining U.S. engagement and programming in the region. For example, Congress should pass the Pacific Partnership Act, a bipartisan bill that requires the administration to create a Strategy for Pacific Partnership, consult more closely with regional organizations such as the Pacific Islands Forum, and collaborate with other regional development partners such as Australia and Japan. Congress should leverage its ability to provide oversight on the executive branch by requiring follow-through on expanding critically needed diplomatic presence in the region and ensure that the Coast Guard—one of the United States’ most effective tools for countering Chinese influence in the security space—continues to be present and engaged in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strategic-partnerships&quot;&gt;Strategic Partnerships&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Trump’s tariff announcements on Liberation Day, Prime Minister James Marape of Papua New Guinea diplomatically stated, “Our trading partners in Asia—including China, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and others—have treated Papua New Guinea with respect, honor, and fairness. These are our closest neighbors and represent proximity markets that continue to offer growing opportunities for our producers.” And, in case the diplomatic niceties obscured his point too much, he concluded, “We will continue to strengthen our trade relations in Asia and the Pacific, where our produce is welcomed. If the U.S. market becomes more difficult due to this tariff, we will simply redirect our goods to markets where there is mutual respect and no artificial barriers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Real influence in the Pacific depends on meaningful relationships, and meaningful relationships are built through partnership, mutual respect, and joint purpose. This can seem harder than making unilateral decisions on U.S. foreign policy, but it is a more long-term—and ultimately more effective—way to do business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the State Department foreign assistance review reaches its conclusion, now is the time to push forward with initiatives that can strengthen U.S. presence, influence, and reach in this critical region. Doing so is not hard, nor is it necessarily expensive. But it requires commitment.&lt;/p&gt;

Much of the current discourse around state threats has been poorly and loosely defined, however, and has failed to ask basic questions such as why state threats are so important now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This briefing note summarises research that addresses these and other concerns, looking to provide firmer definitional boundaries and explore the scale, scope and character of modern state threats within them. Certainly, there is much that is familiar about state threats; many of the actions that fall under its broad umbrella are well-known covert and clandestine acts such as espionage, repression, sabotage, subversion and malign influence, and are closely associated with long-term adversaries of the West, such as Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. However, the research notes that besides the apparent explosion in the volume and range of hostile activity, much is new in their execution and operationalisation. Contemporary state threats combine traditional intelligence tradecraft with new technologies, exploit vulnerabilities that never existed before in societies and economies, and are increasingly outsourced to non-state actors with niche skills, physical access and higher risk tolerances than state agencies. State threats are also not just the preserve of familiar adversary states, with “middle powers” using them as tools of statecraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research finds that state threats’ relative cheapness and deniability allow states to attempt to undermine, coerce and influence their opponents, with limited risk of starting a major war, making them attractive tools for politically assertive states in a time of rapid geopolitical change. Although the impact of hostile actions on Western states has so far been mixed, they have the potential to become more damaging over time as societal resilience wears down, new technologies emerge, hostile actors’ risk tolerances increase and more states participate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2024, the UK faced a wave of state-linked hostile actions within its borders and against its interests. These hostile actions included, but were not limited to, extensive Chinese cyber espionage against UK political, military and commercial targets; Russian espionage, cyber attacks and physical sabotage against supplies to Ukraine; and Iranian attempts to harass and assassinate dissident journalists living in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to officials, state-linked hostile activity in the UK has risen dramatically over the past decade. In March 2023, the assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, Matt Jukes, stated that his force’s casework on foreign interference and espionage had increased fourfold since March 2018, with the attempted poisoning of former Russian intelligence officer Sergei Skripal in Salisbury. This experience has been mirrored across liberal democracies in Europe, North America and the Asia-Pacific region. Consequently, many of these countries’ governments have begun to develop specific policies to respond to the threat of statebacked hostile activity. The problem these policies seek to tackle has been described in various ways, with the UK choosing the term “state threats”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to the growing importance of state threats and a limited body of research on the issue, the Serious Organised Crime &amp;amp; Anti-Corruption Evidence research programme worked with the Royal United Services Institute to set up the inter-disciplinary State Threats Taskforce (STT) in 2023. The STT convened two workshops comprising former practitioners and experts from Europe and Five Eyes countries, which sought to scope the threat landscape faced by the UK and its allies, and current and potential policy responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While helping to sketch the outlines of the challenge, however, the workshops revealed uncertainty – even among those deeply immersed in relevant fields – about fundamental questions, such as the meaning of the term state threats. To address these issues, this research was developed to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clarify the meaning and coherence of the term state threats.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Understand why state threats have emerged as an issue now.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Map out the scope and nature of current state threats.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assess the effectiveness of hostile activity as a tool of state policy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider the potential development in the state threats landscape in the short-to-medium term (two to five years, following definitions of duration common in government and business).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evidence was collected through a desk review of research literature, publicly available official documents, and credible media reports published in English over the previous decade, supplemented by 50 semi-structured interviews with academic experts, researchers, journalists, current and former government officials, and practitioners the Asia-Pacific region, Europe and North America. Interviewees were selected based on their knowledge and expertise on state threats or related areas, specific domains such as cyber or disinformation, and/or specific countries and regions, and provided new insights, further case studies and examples, and validation of emerging findings as the research progressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-findings&quot;&gt;Key findings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;defining-state-threats&quot;&gt;Defining state threats&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western governments and international organisations such as the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) use various terms for hostile activities by states; unsurprisingly, these meanings vary. While terms such as “state threats” or “hostile activity by states” sound identical, their scope can differ; for example, the UK government includes overtly hostile acts, whereas several other governments do not. Moreover, all current government definitions have ambiguities, especially around the importance of hostile intent and levels of state responsibility. Some harmful acts are not necessarily hostile as such – failing to meet climate change commitments, for example – and harmful acts undertaken by non-state actors with state links are not always undertaken at that state’s behest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To clarify these issues, the research sets out a new “working model” definition for state threats that combines the most common elements of existing definitions and seeks to draw pragmatic boundaries where uncertainties exist. Four criteria are identified:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Severity&lt;/strong&gt;: State threats are hostile acts that fall short of the internationally defined nature of war and/or distort and subvert peacetime international rules and norms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source&lt;/strong&gt;: State threats are initiated or encouraged by a state actor and executed by a state or non-state actor for the initiating state’s purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Character&lt;/strong&gt;: State threats are underhand and, by nature, covert, deceptive, corrupt, illegal, coercive and threatening. They may also abuse international rules and norms to achieve hostile ends.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intention and effect&lt;/strong&gt;: State threats cause intentional and politically motivated damage to the interests and assets of another state (or states).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This definition makes clear that state threats must include an intention to cause harm. Certainly, negligent or anti-social behaviour by states, or even positive behaviour which creates dependencies, can be “weaponised” for nefarious purposes at some future point. These types of behaviour should thus be seen as potential vulnerabilities that might become future targets for hostile action. But they should not be treated as immediate threats unless there is evidence of malign intent. Moreover, while all harmful acts of non-state actors cannot be ascribed to states with which they have links, if there is evidence of interaction between a non-state actor and a state, combined with an alignment in hostile behaviours – whether in method, target choice or timing – there are reasonable grounds for seeing non-state actions as state threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-state-threats-moment&quot;&gt;The state threats “moment”&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fundamental reason for state threats’ increasing prominence is mounting hard evidence. Where quantitative data about state-linked hostile actions are available – in the fields of cyber espionage and offensive operations, or online disinformation, for example – the consistent indications are that state involvement is on the rise, with states such as Russia, China, Iran and North Korea playing major roles. These quantitative data are reinforced by numerous qualitative assessments from officials, and intelligence and law enforcement officers in Western countries. However, this is not the only reason why governments are paying attention now. The geopolitical context of the past decade, with events such as Russia’s seizure of Crimea in March 2014 and its fullscale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, have forced Western governments to look at these states’ hostile activities in a new light. What were previously treated as bearable frictions to be downplayed in the interests of maintaining good political and economic relations have increasingly been seen as indications of deep-seated aggressive intentions. Other shifts in the security environment over the past decade have also played a role. While terrorist attacks have continued, government efforts to degrade terrorists’ operational capabilities have helped reduce their impact in comparison to the attacks of the early years of the 21st century. The relative decline in the scale and lethality of such attacks has helped open “policy space” to address the challenge posed by state-linked hostile acts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mapping-state-threats&quot;&gt;Mapping state threats&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research provides a survey of current threats in practice, outlining key areas of hostile activity, examining the methods or vectors of hostile action, and highlighting common targets and purposes behind attacks. Some types of hostile activity are overt. China has employed public diplomatic threats, commonly referred to as “wolf warrior diplomacy”, which imply dire consequences for states that do not comply. Similarly, Russia has made verbal threats against its European neighbours, supported by blatant displays of military force near international boundaries, termed “heavy metal diplomacy” by Russia expert Mark Galeotti.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Covert and clandestine measures&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contemporary state threats are more frequently clandestine or covert, however. The research identifies seven key areas of covert or semi-covert hostile activity:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Espionage&lt;/strong&gt; against state, military and political targets, as well as commercial and knowledgefocused espionage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intimidation&lt;/strong&gt; of dissidents and critics, including harassment, surveillance and “lawfare”, through to kidnapping and assassination.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sabotage&lt;/strong&gt;, including offensive cyber operations and the “systemic overload” of social systems through the weaponisation of criminal activities such as illegal migration.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subversion&lt;/strong&gt; of the information environment to shape the views, actions and decision-making of audiences within a targeted state or states.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Malign influence&lt;/strong&gt; over elite figures and groups with the power and position to guide the public policy of a targeted state.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sponsorship of groups&lt;/strong&gt; seeking to destabilise the existing political order of a targeted state.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Orchestration of regime/government change&lt;/strong&gt; through support for coups d’état or direct interference in electoral processes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Origins and execution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research examines the mechanics behind the initiation and execution of these hostile activities, to the extent possible given their largely secretive nature. Narratives shaped by Western news media frequently portray authoritarian leaders as closely guiding or directing the activities of their bureaucracies. However, the research reveals that state threats can arise from a variety of sources, including “business as usual” official processes, the self-direction of intelligence agencies, and freelance efforts by senior officials or influential private figures, as well as direct requests from state leaders themselves. To further complicate this picture, the research also finds that the operatives employed to carry out hostile acts vary; while intelligence officers remain central to state threat operations, other state officials, party officials and non-state actors are increasingly involved. These include mostly legitimate actors in the private sector, civil society and diaspora communities, alongside the more clandestine realms of private military companies, organised crime, political extremism and terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Patterns of activity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the research does not conduct a quantitative analysis of state threat cases, it does highlight evident trends and patterns in the qualitative evidence from recent years:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There have been “booms” in commercially focused espionage, cyber operations and online disinformation – activities in which technology and “whole-of-society” approaches can enable states to collect high volumes of information and penetrate sensitive systems at speed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;State actors have increasingly incorporated cyber tools into established forms of tradecraft, such as espionage, intimidation, sabotage and malign influence, where technology complements and enhances human activity rather than replacing it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Different states have evolved varied national styles of hostile activity, such as Russia’s high-risk and brazen approach, Iran’s reliance on non-state partners, North Korea’s ambitious cybercrime spree and China’s more carefully calibrated approach. Each style is shaped by that state’s resources, ambitions, cultures and histories.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research also confirms the widespread Western perception that contemporary state threats are largely emerging from four authoritarian regimes – China, Russia, Iran and North Korea – and that liberal democracies are among the major targets. However, it also indicates that hostile acts are not solely the province of authoritarian states and Western countries are not the only victims. In fact, hostile acts between states occur in a variety of contexts, especially among emerging middle powers. Authoritarian and autocratic states have targeted local rivals in conflict zones such as the Middle East, and democratic states such as India have allegedly used hostile acts against state rivals and dissidents both within their own regions and sometimes within the borders of Western states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is shaping these patterns of behaviour? The research suggests that each of the four most hostile states in question has its own distinctive culture, history and ambitions but is also subject to broader trends at work. At macro-level, what the research sees as “geopolitical climate change” is fundamental. Leading non-Western powers such as China and Russia have long preferred a world order shaped by great powers, spheres of influence and state sovereignty, instead of a Western vision of a rules-based international order dominated by the US. Now, with the shift of economic and political power away from the US and its allies, China and major developing economies not only have a desire to see the world work in support of their interests, but they also have the strength to make it happen – the kind of historical turning point that has often resulted in open war in the past. However, although China and other states enjoy growing economic and military strength relative to the West, open conflict could entail substantial and even existential risks. Consequently, hostile acts that fall short of war offer alternative ways to signal resistance to Western states and undermine Western interests, while avoiding the threat of a substantial response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What motivates the wider use of hostile actions beyond the four main perpetrators? Many of the states in question are located close to conflict zones or in high-risk regions, and have used covert and clandestine means against their exiled opponents and local enemies for many years. However, even among the middle powers, there are indications that the use of state threats is on the rise and that this too is probably one of the effects of geopolitical climate change. With the US and its allies both less willing and less able to play the role of global law enforcer, smaller states are taking matters into their own hands, but without risking open conflict: in the words of political scientist Ivan Krastev, they “are determined to be at the table, and not on the menu”. There is also a possibility that states are emulating patterns of behaviour they see other states using with relatively little consequence. As international relations scholar Shogo Suzuki has suggested, the development of “delinquent gangs” among states can, over time, lead to a wider contagion of behaviours between states that were previously seen as unacceptable by the international community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;novelty-and-effectiveness-of-state-threats&quot;&gt;Novelty and effectiveness of state threats&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those with sceptical views of the potential impact of clandestine and covert action use various arguments: that such activities are not new and have not had an impact in the past; that they are inherently difficult to execute successfully and therefore have limited value as policy tools; and that their results are never certain and, indeed, can be counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be sure, state-backed hostile activities are not a complete novelty, and have a long and continuous global history, even during relatively peaceful periods. Nonetheless, the research finds it hard to understate the sheer volume of hostile activity currently being registered by senior Western intelligence officials, who have used language that frames the current wave of hostile acts in distinctly “epic” and “epoch-making” terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the explosion in volume, moreover, there is much that is new in the way contemporary state threats are executed. Cyber tools play an increasingly important role in well-known activities such as espionage, harassment, sabotage and disinformation. Importantly, however, cyber has not so much replaced traditional human intelligence tradecraft, but has been combined with it, creating a form of technologically augmented clandestine and covert action, providing opportunities for a greater volume, velocity and range of hostile acts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also new is the comprehensiveness of the approaches being used by China and Russia; their whole-of-society strategies have expanded the range of channels they use to conduct their activities, and they have strayed far from the classic state agency foci of official, military and political targets into the commercial, scientific and even societal realms as well. As Russia expert Keir Giles says of the Kremlin’s online campaign against dissent and overseas criticism, “it is a profound mistake for anybody to assume that they are too unimportant to be a target”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research also offers a cautious perspective on the question of effectiveness. To be sure, the picture is mixed. As intelligence historian Rory Cormac points out, few covert acts have unambiguously positive or longterm results for the perpetrators. Critics have not been cowed, Western economies have not been crippled and most Western governments have largely remained true to pre-existing policies. In fact, many of these hostile acts have also come at significant reputational cost to the perpetrators, as well as leading to policy countermeasures such as sanctions, prosecutions and the expulsion of intelligence operatives, which have the perverse effect of reducing the perpetrators’ long-term capabilities and access to their targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, this optimistic perspective might prove misguided, as the research notes several examples of hostile state action that cannot be seen as anything other than successes. China’s massive campaign of commercial espionage has certainly reaped an enormous economic dividend. In the words of General Keith Alexander, former head of US Cyber Command, it has probably been “the single greatest transfer of wealth in history”. North Korea’s cybercrime spree of recent years has also probably netted it many billions in US dollars’ worth of cryptocurrency, propping up the regime of Kim Jong Un and allowing it to continue its development of weapons of mass destruction. In other cases, hostile efforts might have played a contributory role in enabling the perpetrator’s desired outcome; some, though not all, see Russian interference in the US 2016 presidential election as a potential example. Moreover, immediate or consistent “results,” as often demanded by Western governments, may not necessarily be the aim of many of these actions. States employing hostile actions might have varying metrics of success; they may be content with achieving only an occasional “lucky hit” or expect that actions will have a measurable impact on their targets’ resilience over the medium-to-long term. It is also conceivable, as political scientists Austin Carson and Karen Yarhi-Milo argue, that states engaging in covert actions view those actions as means to “signal” credibility, strength and intent to other governments, without the accompanying risks associated with military action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;state-threat-futures&quot;&gt;State threat futures&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the challenges Russia has faced in Ukraine, Iran’s recent setbacks in the Middle East and North Korea’s noticeable economic difficulties, all three continue to possess the apparent will, intent and sufficient means to pursue their current range of hostile activities. In some cases – Russia, for example – there also appears to be a growing willingness to take greater risks, escalating levels of violence and the potential threat to life. Most importantly, China boasts vast capabilities and, particularly in the realm of offensive cyber operations, has been demonstrating a heightened level of aggressiveness and readiness to pre-position assets for acts of sabotage against Western infrastructure, presumably in preparation for a potential future crisis in the South or East China Seas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the relative openness of Western economies, societies and systems, all four revisionist states have good access to potential targets and, where they do not, can work with a range of deniable partners and proxies that do – especially in the criminal fraternity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As new technologies such as varieties of artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing develop, opportunities for these states to enhance and extend their capabilities will also grow, although policymakers should be cautious about magnifying the effect they will have; advanced technologies can be hard to deploy and have defensive as well as offensive possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the four main current perpetrators of state threats, the research predicts their increasing use by middle powers, particularly in the Global South. As the US and other Western powers withdraw from direct involvement in regional conflicts in areas such as the Sahel, Southern Africa, the Middle East and South-East Asia, local powers are likely to become more inclined to employ tools that can assist them in damaging, deterring or influencing rivals without triggering conflict. Middle powers’ use of state threats is most likely to occur in the deployment of cyber tools for transnational repression, espionage, offensive cyber operations and online information operations. At the same time, the experience of the past decade suggests that these states might become more ambitious, daring, physical and kinetic over time, and, like the current four states of concern, increasingly turn towards non-state partners and proxies to supplement their capabilities. There is also a risk that some liberal democracies will be increasingly tempted to expand their own use of aggressive activities below the threshold of armed conflict in response to the changing international environment, testing the limits of existing law and ethical constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, while the research indicates that state threats have had somewhat mixed effects thus far, this does not guarantee a decline in their use or a lack of impact in the future. Their relative cheapness and apparent lack of political risk are likely to make them attractive tools of statecraft in the short-tomedium term for various types of states, and their sustained use over time is also likely to have corrosive effects, especially in young democracies or emerging economies that are less well placed to resist them; for example, in regions such as the Balkans and the Sahel. Even highly resilient developed states with robust protections in place may also face greater risks of physical damage or long-term corrosive effects on social cohesion in the face of sustained hostile activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications&quot;&gt;Implications&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research does not aim to provide a comprehensive overview of how targeted Western states have responded to various types of state threats, although several initiatives aimed at strengthening economic security, democratic integrity and social cohesion in European and Five Eyes countries are acknowledged. Consequently, the research does not assess the quality and effectiveness of Western responses to the challenge of state threats, nor does it offer detailed policy proposals. However, the research findings hold significant implications for the framing and implementation of future policy for Western governments, which are outlined in five groups of observations below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;observation-1-avoid-wishful-thinking-and-ignorance-when-assessing-threats-and-vulnerabilities&quot;&gt;Observation 1: Avoid wishful thinking and ignorance when assessing threats and vulnerabilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past 20 years, many Western states have turned a “blind eye” to the hostile actions of states such as Russia and China, prioritising economic relationships and seeing such behaviour as an aberration that can be ignored. Since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, this perspective has changed, although the pronouncements of the recently re-elected US President Donlad Trump suggest the possibility of a less united Western front in the face of Russian aggression at least. The research indicates, however, that regardless of variations in Western policy, the current challenge from state threats will continue. The hostile conduct of states such as Russia, China and Iran, and their use of state threats, reflect their longterm desire to see a world order that rejects liberal rules and norms in favour of hard sovereignty and spheres of influence, within which Western power will be diminished. Unless the US and its allies decide to accept that fate – which seems unlikely, regardless of President Trump’s rhetoric – the underlying reasons for conflict will continue. State threats from Russia, China and their associates are unlikely to disappear anytime soon, and may proliferate more widely in their use among non-aligned middle powers and even democratic states. Thus, Western governments must grasp, and continue to acknowledge the significance, dynamics and probable longevity of the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western governments must also avoid hubris and overconfidence in their assessment of how wellpositioned they are to resist state threats. Open societies present significant attack surfaces for aggressive states. As governments have learned in preparing for disasters, it is perilous to assume that the worst experiences of the past are the right benchmarks for future catastrophes. While Western states have so far not faced major setbacks due to hostile state activity, the possibility that an act of physical sabotage or an offensive cyber operation might have disastrous consequences, including major loss of life, cannot be ruled out. Over the longer term, moreover, the hard-to-detect corrosive effects of persistent hostile activity may indeed begin to surface. If the intensity and potential impact of such activities escalate, current levels of Western resilience and efforts to enhance it may prove insufficient to the task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To an extent, Western governments are relatively well-placed to understand state threats and their own vulnerabilities because of the high competence and knowledge of their diplomatic cadres, and intelligence and security agencies. Since the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 in the US, Western governments have also developed expertise in resilience and protective security. However, in many Western states, government departments and agencies are woefully under-resourced in relevant linguistic and cultural expertise or appropriate technical skills. They have, moreover, obvious gaps in their bodies of knowledge and expertise when it comes to understanding more intangible matters such as democratic resilience and social cohesion, or the full spectrum of their countries’ vulnerabilities and dependencies on other states, especially complex international systems such as trade, finance, energy supplies and communications infrastructure. If governments are to be able to understand and act upon threats and vulnerabilities, therefore, they must consider whether they have the right people with the right knowledge in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;observation-2-understand-opponents-thinking&quot;&gt;Observation 2: Understand opponents’ thinking&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research highlights the differing mindsets and worldviews of Russia, China, Iran and North Korea that have allowed them to develop their challenges to the international rules-based order. In all four instances, the strategic cultures of these states show a fluid attitude towards what constitutes peace or war, and an attraction to seeking out loopholes in previously accepted legal frameworks and international norms of behaviour. As Australian scholar-soldier David Kilcullen points out, Russia and China have sought to test the West vertically by pushing hostile actions to the threshold of armed conflict and horizontally by expanding forms of hostile action across a wide range of areas, many of them unexpected, such as illegal migration. For Western governments and international organisations that emphasise clear legal boundaries and due process, state threats thus pose deep challenges when it comes to framing appropriate and timely responses. Very often, Western governments and organisations simply do not have in place the appropriate structures, processes or capacity to cope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This suggests that Western countries need to reconsider whether the clear peace/war dichotomy on which they have based their policies for many decades (if not centuries) still makes sense when their opponents are happy to ignore the boundary between them. It further indicates Western countries need to take a more imaginative approach to which sectors threats might emerge from and in what combinations. These suggestions should not be seen as a plea to governments to take an “anything goes” approach or to mindlessly pursue novel potential threats. Legality, and principles of ethics necessity and proportionality, should remain essential to the character of Western responses, as should an ongoing focus on core areas of national security. However, if Western governments do not show more agility, flexibility and creativity in how they respond to state threats, they will risk confirming the assessments of opponents who see them as easy targets, inviting further hostile action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;observation-3-ask-whether-the-current-resilience-focused-model-of-response-is-enough&quot;&gt;Observation 3: Ask whether the current resilience-focused model of response is enough&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the core Western approach to state threats is a state-agnostic, resilience-focused model that sometimes seeks to deter or disrupt state threats at source, or use punitive or retaliatory responses – but largely eschews offensive operations and takes a piecemeal approach to developing shared international standards of behaviour. This is especially true in cyberspace, where a strong focus on civilian cyber security has been combined with “persistent engagement” with attackers – a phrase used by cyber scholars Michael Fischerkeller and Richard Harknett. Alongside this, Western powers have also undertaken a desultory diplomatic pursuit of international standards for cyber operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the long-term nature of the threat, however, a key question that Western governments need to address is whether the current balance between different types of measures is appropriate. The resilience-based model alone is far from cost-free, and there will be natural and appropriate concerns about the risks of heavy-handed legislation or regulation of fundamental freedoms, whether political, social or economic. The cost of upgrading the resilience of existing systems, structures and processes, or better yet by building it in by design, would need to be explicitly accepted; and, to protect civil liberties, checks and balances on intrusive legislation such as legislative renewals and sunset clauses would need to be considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, governments must consider whether they are prepared to protect and insulate themselves from hostile actions and more frequently pre-empt attacks, react to them and possibly escalate in response. Western states must carefully evaluate how to alter aggressors’ “return on investment” calculations, not only by mitigating the effects of hostile state behaviour, but also by imposing costs that may shift the decisionmaking processes of perpetrator states. Doing so might offer Western governments more opportunities to shape the environment they face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if they choose a more assertive path, they will also need to calibrate how far they are willing to go. Quite apart from triggering a hostile response, such behaviours could have a potentially degrading effect on the West’s ideas about itself, its standards and its wider reputation, as the US intelligence community found in the wake of revelations about its past behaviour in the mid-1970s. Were legal and ethical tolerances to change dramatically, and the consequences of these changes to become public, there could be negative effects on public trust in the institutions of government and damage to the reputation of Western states as upholders of international standards, feeding Chinese and Russian narratives, about Western hypocrisy and further undermining the integrity and stability of the rules-based order. If reactive and explicitly offensive measures are to come into play, therefore, they will need to be circumscribed and calibrated within legal and ethical bounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To mitigate the accusations that the West is just as bad as its opponents and to create preventative measures against proliferating hostile state behaviours, Western states will also need to consider what they do to shape international standards. Assertive diplomacy in multilateral and “minilateral” forums might kickstart discussions about international standards in non-military conflict, starting with cyberspace, but expanding to cover the role and scope of espionage, sabotage and subversion outside periods of traditionally defined war. Although these are unlikely to gain immediate traction with states such as Russia, Iran or North Korea, they may gain a hearing with a less truculent China and offer a nucleus of consensus that could help provide a barrier to the proliferation of hostile activities in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;observation-4-shape-a-coherent-comprehensive-and-prioritised-set-of-responses&quot;&gt;Observation 4: Shape a coherent, comprehensive and prioritised set of responses&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research highlights the complex and often decentralised nature of how state threats emerge in perpetrator states. Regime objectives are sometimes achieved through top-down direction and at other times via more entrepreneurial initiatives. These regimes have various channels of operational action available to them, including both state agencies and state-linked non-state actors. Western governments must be cognisant of this reality, while also refraining from assuming that an equally diffuse set of countermeasures will be effective in response. In fact, the frequently episodic character and disorienting effect of state threats necessitate that Western governments develop clear and coherent narratives and strategies to avoid losing sight of the significance of these threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western governments therefore need to consider how best to organise their responses, giving particular attention to threats’ cross-domain character. This will necessitate a coherent risk assessment and a common strategy across government and society. National governments need to develop a “single point of view” on state threats, and effective leadership and coordination mechanisms to guide and oversee strategic implementation, necessitating closer cooperation between agencies and government departments dealing with different dimensions of the same problem. One such area is tackling the activities of state-linked organised crime, which will require coordination, intelligence sharing, and even joint-working between intelligence agencies and law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prioritisation will also be essential. Countries must carefully assess the full range of threats and vulnerabilities, while pragmatically considering the time and resources available. Not all vulnerabilities can be addressed simultaneously and the order in which they are tackled is significant. In this context, governments may find it tempting to concentrate on familiar areas, as much resilience work will involve the protection of processes, networks, assets and people, most of which will be relatively easy to map and measure. However, governments must also address the more intangible elements of democratic and societal resilience, which are sometimes perceived as overly challenging to tackle but likely pose the greatest existential risks if left unmitigated. Furthermore, governments need to remain vigilant and responsive to emerging threats or vectors of attack. However, they should not unthinkingly pursue novel issues for their own sake, shifting resources en masse at the expense of tackling existing and unmitigated challenges. This is particularly important when considering the potential impact of AI, the promise and dangers of which are far from clear at present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;observation-5-take-an-approach-based-on-partnership-both-domestically-and-internationally&quot;&gt;Observation 5: Take an approach based on partnership, both domestically and internationally&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the research indicates, in some of the most active perpetrator states, particularly Russia and China, the regimes adopt a whole-of-society approach to executing clandestine and covert activity. Furthermore, although these states do not appear to have established security ties with one another comparable to a Five Eyes-type relationship, there are signs of cooperation in sharing online expertise and evading sanctions, and in the sphere of online disinformation, with states recycling and echoing the narratives of the other revisionist states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The liberal democratic states of the West cannot aspire to emulate authoritarians’ mobilisation of private enterprise and civil society as instruments of the state. Moreover, they should refrain from doing so if they wish to uphold their essential character as open societies. Nevertheless, Western states do not confront a binary choice; the continuum between open and closed societies is wide. As past crises such as the Covid-19 pandemic indicate, liberal democracies can work together in pursuit of broader objectives, temporarily limiting some freedoms without discarding them entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most effective ways to achieve coherence outside of such an obvious crisis is through a partnership model, which may impose some new obligations on the private sector and civil society but will also require willing cooperation, support and initiative from non-governmental actors. The value of this approach has already been observed in areas such as the fight against financial crime, both in the UK and beyond. However, for partnerships to succeed, governments must share a clear threat picture to provide incentives for action, establish a coherent strategy in response and work with non-governmental partners to develop mechanisms for cooperation. In summary, governments need to take businesses, organisations and the wider public into their confidence if they are to address state threats effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the research indicates that the issue of state threats cannot be tackled by a single state in isolation. An international perspective is vital. Many of the threats facing Western states are analogous, as are the vulnerabilities to these dangers. In specific instances, such as the fragility of international infrastructure, these constitute shared challenges. Developing a coherent cross-border response, whether initially through minilateral coalitions of like-minded states or ultimately through broader multilateral platforms such as NATO or the EU, is crucial. Concurrently, the growing risk of the escalating use of state threats by middle powers highlights the necessity for dialogue regarding the perils of persistent hostile activities and their impact on societal resilience and stability. The UN would serve as the obvious platform for this discussion; however, given current divisions within the UN Security Council, more fruitful approaches will likely arise from engagement at bilateral, minilateral and regional levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India is navigating a volatile global order by asserting its strategic autonomy amid rising tensions between major powers. Historically non-aligned, India follows a flexible foreign policy approach balancing ties with both the West and Russia. Despite US pressure and the mounting threat of sanctions, India maintains deep defence ties with Russia. This cooperation reflects both strategic necessity and energy dependence, with discounted Russian oil now a major import.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the dim-lit antechambers of global power, India stands as both witness and architect to a world on the edge of multipolar chaos. The tectonic plates of international order are shifting, and New Delhi – long a master of strategic ambiguity – now finds itself the subject of a more perilous experiment in global pressure with Washington brandishing the threat of sweeping tariffs and secondary sanctions. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham’s bill – stipulating 500% tariffs on countries buying Russian oil to curb Moscow’s aggression against Ukraine – puts India’s time-honoured doctrine of “strategic autonomy” to its severest test. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte’s subsequent warning to India of being hit “very hard” by secondary sanctions if it continues to trade with Russia only underlines the gravity of the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India’s foreign policy, once defined by the stoic non-alignment of Nehruvian vintage, has undergone a metamorphosis in recent years. No longer content with the passivity of balancing, India now orchestrates a grand pivot strategy, leveraging its unique geography as the hinge between Europe and Asia. This is not mere opportunism, but a conscious recalibration – an attempt to elicit concessions and assurances from both Washington and Moscow, to shape the architecture of regional security to its own advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India’s strategic calculus is undergirded by its defence procurement patterns. Despite overtures from the West, over 60% of India’s military hardware remains Russian in origin – an insurance policy rather than a Cold War relic. The Russian-made S-400 air defence, the BrahMos cruise missile joint venture, and the ongoing localization of the AK-203 rifle serve as potent reminders to adversaries and allies alike that India’s deterrence posture is robust and diversified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the recent India-Pakistan 4-day war, the S-400 missile system performed well. By late 2025, India will take delivery of the fourth of five S-400 system, with the final unit due in 2026. The deal, inked in 2018 despite American debates over CAATSA sanctions, signalled India’s enduring commitment to strategic autonomy. In continuing these acquisitions amid the Ukraine war and Western sanctions on Moscow, New Delhi has underscored its refusal to subordinate national security imperatives to external pressure, preserving room to manoeuvre in a shifting geopolitical landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, within the Indian foreign policy establishment, a philosophical schism endures. On one side stand the realists, who recall the Soviet vetoes at the UNSC and see the Russia relationship as a sacred trust. For them, to abandon Moscow is to risk strategic orphan-hood and invite encirclement by a Sino-Russian axis stretching from the Himalayas to the Indian Ocean. The pragmatists, however, see a Russia diminished; it has not only become economically dependent on Beijing, but its global influence has also been eroded by the pointless quagmire in Ukraine. They argue for a pivot to American technology and the security umbrella of the Quad, cautioning that continued proximity to Moscow could trigger secondary sanctions and imperil India’s economic ambitions. India’s economy is closely interwoven with the West through robust trade and corporate ties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Necessity, as ever, asserts itself. India’s energy security is now inextricably tied to Russian crude, which accounts for over a third of its imports. Paradoxically, Western sanctions have only deepened this dependency, offering India discounted oil and a hedge against global price volatility. India exploits the fissures in the Western sanctions regime to secure its own economic stability, even as it diversifies its defence procurement and technology partnerships in the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India’s foreign policy now operates within a complex web of overlapping interests and transactional alliances – a “Multipolar Manoeuvre Matrix”. The old binaries of democracy versus autocracy, East versus West, have given way to a landscape defined by nuance and flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a calibrated assertion of its strategic autonomy, India has deepened its role within the Quad, hosting joint naval exercises alongside the United States, Japan, and Australia in the Bay of Bengal – a maritime signal of Indo-Pacific resolve. This commitment was further highlighted when the foreign ministers of the Quad met in Washington on July 1, for their latest meeting, reinforcing their shared vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific and launching new initiatives on maritime security and critical minerals cooperation. Simultaneously, through the I2U2 initiative and the India-Middle East-Europe Corridor, New Delhi extends its economic and geopolitical reach westward, weaving new ties across the Arabian Peninsula and into Europe. Yet, in a deft balancing act, India sustains robust participation in BRICS, preserving dialogue within alternative, non-Western multilateral frameworks – as reflected in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s participation in the BRICS Summit held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on 6–7 July 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The danger for India is not simply American retaliation for its Russia ties. It is the risk of being caught in a bilateral squeeze, where any move toward one pole is interpreted as betrayal by the other. In India’s strategic calculus, China is the main adversary, with Pakistan serving as a proxy – a “borrowed knife” wielded by Beijing to advance its own agenda. Should India distance itself from Moscow, it risks a reverse pivot – Russia intensifying defence cooperation with Pakistan or becoming wholly dependent on China, both scenarios inimical to Indian security. Conversely, standing too firmly by Moscow could fracture India’s deepening partnerships with the United States and Europe, undermining its aspirations for technological and economic modernization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent incidents illustrate this peril. Reports have surfaced of Russia exploring lucrative deals with Pakistan, underscored by a quiet trade forum held in Moscow in late 2024 – moves widely interpreted as Moscow hedging its bets in South Asia. Though Russia condemned the Pahalgam terror attack, Moscow notably avoided directly blaming Pakistan, reflecting an evasive stance that subtly shields Islamabad. At the same time, American officials have warned of possible sanctions should India continue to expand its defence ties with Russia, even as they court India as a bulwark against China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To navigate this thicket, India has developed a sophisticated sanctions-evasion strategy. Indian companies, facing the threat of being locked out of the dollar-based global financial system, have sought alternative payment mechanisms – trading in rupees or roubles, and deepening investments in Russian energy assets to generate dividend flows for defence purchases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not mere circumvention; it is a calculated strategy to preserve autonomy in the face of extraterritorial pressure. At the same time, India invests in American industries, creating jobs and goodwill that can be leveraged to temper US policy decisions. The result is a dynamic, adaptive approach that seeks to maximize manoeuvrability while minimizing exposure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Western capitals urge decisive alignment and rapid decoupling from Russia, New Delhi moves with deliberate caution. India has abstained on United Nations votes, refused to condemn Moscow outright, and maintained high-level diplomatic engagement with both sides. This patience is a recognition that the tectonic plates of global order are still shifting, and that premature commitments could foreclose future options. Despite mounting pressures, Indo-Russian ties endure. Defence cooperation is institutionalized through regular exchanges, joint military exercises, and co-production deals. The relationship has evolved from a simple buyer-seller dynamic to one of joint research, design, and production – exemplified by projects like BrahMos and the Su-30MKI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, this circuit is not immune to strain. The growing Sino-Russian partnership, the uncertainties of the Ukraine conflict, and the lure of Western technology all test its durability. Like a chessboard in flux, India must manoeuvre deftly – balancing between opportunity and peril – to ensure this partnership remains an asset, not a strategic liability, amid shifting tectonics of global order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indian foreign policy, far from dogma, is a living dialectic. It is an evolving engagement with the world, informed by history yet unshackled by it. In an era defined by unravelling alliances and multiplying crises, India seeks autonomy. The shifting tectonics of global power cannot allow it to remain passive. The burden and privilege before India is to remain the axis upon which the fragile equilibrium of the international order may yet depend.&lt;/p&gt;

The underlying policy challenge has been described in various ways, including “hostile activity by states” and “threats from state actors”, with the UK government choosing the term “state threats”. However, while sounding similar, these definitions have differences in scope and meaning that can affect how researchers might assess the character, scope and impact of the current threat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This synthesis paper thus explores the commonalities and differences in the policy definitions Western states use to conceptualise the underlying threat from state actors, drawing on the Serious Organised Crime &amp;amp; Anti-Corruption Evidence (SOC ACE) research programme Research Paper Old Wine, New Bottles? The Challenge of State Threats. The research identifies several basic similarities across existing definitions, which highlight clandestine, covert and coercive state activities as core elements of the threat. However, it also identifies variations in scope and meaning around the levels of hostile intent needed to justify seeing a state action as a threat. It further addresses the extent to which states might be held responsible for the acts of non-state actors, such as terrorist networks and organised crime groups (OCGs), with which they might have relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To clarify these issues, the research sets out a new “working model” for state threats that combines the most common elements of existing definitions and seeks to draw pragmatic boundaries where uncertainties exist. According to the research, state threats are politically and intentionally motivated hostile acts that are underhand and largely, but not exclusively, covert by nature. They fall short of the internationally defined nature of war, and are initiated or encouraged by state actors and executed by state or non-state actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research makes clear that state threats must include an intent to cause harm; and that neutral or even positive actions (such as an investment creating an economic interdependency), which might later be “weaponised” for nefarious purposes, should be seen as potential vulnerabilities, rather than state threats in themselves. Moreover, the research argues that the harmful acts of non-state actors should only be seen as state threats where there is evidence of interaction between a non-state actor and a state, combined with an alignment in hostile behaviours – whether in method, target choice or timing. While non-state actors are potential tools of a state, they are not the state itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to UK officials, state-linked hostile activity in the UK has risen dramatically over the past decade. In March 2023, the assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, Matt Jukes, stated that his force’s casework on foreign interference and espionage had increased fourfold since March 2018, with the attempted poisoning of former Russian intelligence officer Sergei Skripal in Salisbury. This challenge has been described in various ways in Western countries, with the UK choosing the term “state threats”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to the growing policy importance of state threats and a limited body of research on the issue, the Serious Organised Crime &amp;amp; Anti-Corruption Evidence research programme worked with the Royal United Services Institute to set up the inter-disciplinary State Threats Taskforce (STT) in 2023. The STT convened two workshops comprising former practitioners and experts from Europe and Five Eyes countries, which sought to scope the threat landscape faced by the UK and its allies, and current and potential policy responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While helping to sketch the outlines of the challenge, however, the workshops also revealed uncertainty – even among those deeply immersed in relevant fields – about the nature, character and scope of state threats. Therefore, new research has been undertaken to address key questions about the challenge of state threats. The research draws on research literature, publicly available official documents, and credible media reports published in English over the previous decade, supplemented by 50 semi-structured interviews with academic experts, researchers, journalists, current and former government officials, and practitioners the Asia-Pacific region, Europe and North America. The primary question it addresses – and the focus of this paper – is how best to define the term state threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-findings&quot;&gt;Key findings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;current-academic-research-does-not-provide-a-definition-of-state-threats&quot;&gt;Current academic research does not provide a definition of state threats&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research notes that, unsurprisingly, given the relative novelty of the term state threats, academic literature on the concept is currently limited. Nonetheless, a substantial body of literature exists on related subject areas pertinent to the field. The two most significant are “hybrid” and “grey zone” activities. These terms are often paired with various nouns such as war, warfare, conflict or threats to create a variety of compound terms such as “hybrid warfare” or “grey zone conflict”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of hybrid warfare, as conceived by modern military thinkers, first emerged in 1999 in Unrestricted Warfare, a book by two colonels in the Chinese People’s Liberation Army, Qiao Liang and Wang Xiangsui. The authors argued that China must use “all means, including armed force or non-armed force, military and non-military, and lethal and non-lethal means to compel the enemy to accept one’s interest”. Separately, in the following decade, US Marine colonel and scholar Frank Hoffman used the term “hybrid war” in a 2007 article, identifying it as the use of blended military tactics exemplified by state and non-state actors such as Islamist group Hezbollah. The term hybrid war was also used in Russian military discussions (in Russian as gibridnaya voina), framed as a type of political warfare at which the US was adept and Russia needed to master, mixing military methods with economic action, information campaigns and political subversion. Despite the differences in the use of the word hybrid in various countries, however, at its core its meaning lies in the “addition and combination” of a variety of methods and tools “bringing into play the maximum range of categories of conflict and combining them in novel ways”, as noted by Australian soldier-scholar David Kilcullen. Hybridity is thus closely allied to, if not identical with, the idea of “weaponisation”, which Russia expert Mark Galeotti defines as “the notion of items and concepts not usually connected with conflict” being used as forms of attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A related area of research focuses on “grey zone” conflict. Although hybrid warfare shares conceptual common ground in its preference for unconventionality, grey zone activities emphasise the use of ambiguous methods to achieve political ends, damaging a target without detection or attribution and thus making a robust response less likely. In this, grey zone activities are close to the older concept of “covert action”, defined by US intelligence expert Loch Johnson as “clandestine intervention in the affairs of other nations”. The grey zone concept also dovetails well with newer ideas developed in the realm of cyber studies, such as “intelligence conflicts”, defined by cyber experts Robert Chesney and Max Smeets as “statecraft pursued by the means and methods traditionally associated with intelligence agencies”; or “persistent engagement”, defined by cyber expert Michael Fischerkeller and associates as an ongoing struggle “calibrated to remain below the threshold that would elicit an armed response, seeking instead to produce cumulative gains over time”. Throughout all these definitions, there is a shared focus on the use of less easily detectable and attributable methods to achieve political ends with limited consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These various terms provide value to researchers studying state threats. They highlight different styles of hostile activity that states may employ, whether combining methods, exploiting unexpected avenues, or playing with thresholds and norms. Moreover, despite a primary focus on these activities in the context of military affairs or near-war scenarios, they also have relevance to what Western states would see as conventional peacetime activities of intelligence agencies and their partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, critically, none of these academic definitions provide a comprehensive underpinning for what states are discussing when they refer to state threats or similar concepts. Firstly, while the academic literature addresses the use of hybrid methods and grey zone activities by state actors, it also references examples of non-state actors employing similar approaches. These methods are not exclusive to states. Secondly, and more importantly, by defining threats based on types of activity, these terms exclude the possibility of states employing methods that are neither hybrid, innovative, unexpected nor ambiguous. It is logically conceivable that a state could use a singular, familiar and only lightly covert form of hostile action that instinctively feels like a state threat – such as a one-off assassination of a foreign political figure – without it easily fitting into the category of a hybrid or grey zone threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-uks-has-held-an-actor-agnostic-and-behaviour-focused-view-of-state-threats&quot;&gt;The UK’s has held an actor-agnostic and behaviour-focused view of state threats&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the UK, the term state threats emerged around 2017-18 and was used to name a new Joint State Threats Assessment Team, created in June 2017 and based at the UK Security Service (MI5)’s Thames House headquarters. For a period, ministers and officials also used other terms alongside state threats to refer to the challenges posed by states’ hostile actions, including “hostile state activity”, “hostile activity by states” and “state-based threats”. However, by 2021, state threats had become the UK’s preferred descriptor. The Home Office set out its definition of state threats in its Consultation on Legislation to Counter State Threats (Hostile State Activity), issued in May 2021, which introduced measures later included in the National Security Act 2023. According to the consultation, state threats comprise:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Overt or covert action orchestrated by foreign governments which falls short of general armed conflict … but nevertheless seeks to undermine or threaten the safety and interests of the UK, including: the integrity of its democracy, its public safety, its military advantage and its reputation or economic prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation also defines five key state threat categories, which cover the classic and well-known behaviours of state intelligence and security agencies, while largely not using traditional terms such as sabotage or subversion. They comprise:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Threats to people&lt;/strong&gt;, through harassment or physical violence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Threats to things&lt;/strong&gt;, such as the nation’s critical national infrastructure or overseas supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Espionage&lt;/strong&gt; against both the public and private sectors, including academic, scientific, technological and commercial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interference&lt;/strong&gt; in political, electoral, economic or social processes or decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Threats to geostrategic interests&lt;/strong&gt; in the reshaping of international norms, and misuse of rules, norms and agreements to coerce other states.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key underlying theme of the UK state threats definition is that it primarily focuses on hostile activities rather than the identities of the state actors behind them. According to the Home Office, this decision was made because the UK government did not want to imply that state actors using hostile acts were inherently or permanently hostile towards the UK. However, despite this, several leading UK intelligence leaders have been specific in pinpointing the main culprits as Russia, China, Iran and North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;western-states-use-a-variety-of-similar-but-not-identical-policy-definitions-to-the-uk&quot;&gt;Western states use a variety of similar but not identical policy definitions to the UK&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research shows that international organisations and Western governments use various terms to describe hostile activities by states. NATO and the EU have used the term “hybrid threats” for some time. The European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats (Hybrid CoE), a joint initiative of the two organisations, defines such threats as actions “conducted by state or non-state actors, whose goal is to undermine or harm a target by combining overt and covert military and non-military means”. In contrast, recently created policy formulations, such as the UK’s, have focused specifically on state-linked behaviours and have not limited their scope to hybrid activities alone. Below are three more recent examples from the Netherlands, Canada and Australia, showing the similarities and parallels between definitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/447Ruoi.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: Non-UK terminology on state threats-type activity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among these terms and definitions, the NATO/EU language concerning hybrid threats stands out as an outlier, deeply rooted in early military discussions from when Western countries were still confronting the rise of the Islamic State in the Middle East, alongside Russia’s annexation of Crimea. By emphasising hybridity as a type of attack employed by various actors, it fails to address state activity specifically and should, therefore, be set aside in favour of more recent terminology that does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While none of the state-centric contemporary definitions exactly matches the UK’s definition, each implicitly shares similar perspectives on the character and scope of the threats being identified. These include their severity (falling below the internationally defined nature of war); source (originating with states, even if carried out by non-state actors); character (covert, deceptive, corrupt, illegal, coercive or surreptitiously threatening); and intent (to damage other states’ interests).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, despite “family resemblances”, there are also notable differences. While the consensus is to focus on behaviours that are likely to be conducted secretly or duplicitously, the UK also includes overt hostile acts, greatly expanding the definition’s scope. A further difference is in the level of hostile intent required for an act to qualify as a state threat or equivalent. In the definitions of Canada and the UK, a hostile act is intended to harm the interests of another state; intent is apparent. In the case of the Netherlands, however, the definition also encompasses undermining actions that could harm another state’s interests. Although political intent is implied, it is not explicitly required. On such grounds, a vast range of antisocial state behaviours – environmental pollution and failing to meet treaty obligations, for example – could be interpreted as state threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The definitions also demonstrate other ambiguities about levels of state intent. For example, the definitions assume that a state act is either hostile or not. However, some state behaviours might have several intentions behind them, both positive and potentially negative. For example, the provision of aid, investment or technology transfers could be intended to help while also providing the donor with a level of leverage over the recipient. They might be used for good or ill. Even if such help starts with purely positive motives, it has the potential for abuse in the future: political intentions can change over time. However, to designate such interstate interactions as hostile acts because they might become so would require that wide swathes of normal diplomacy be seen as potentially hostile acts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final area of difficulty is the role of non-state actors, which is explicit in several definitions and implied in others. While an OCG or terrorist network might occasionally act on behalf of or partner with a state, such groups are also likely to pursue their own agenda, which, while damaging to other states, is not directed, encouraged or required by their state partner. To include all non-state actors’ activities would, therefore, magnify the scale of state-linked hostile activity, while excluding them would almost certainly understate the scope of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-pragmatic-process-of-reconciliation-is-needed-to-provide-a-working-definition-of-state-threats&quot;&gt;A pragmatic process of reconciliation is needed to provide a working definition of state threats&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving aside the outlier concept of hybrid threats, the research notes various approaches that might be used to reconcile the differences between more contemporary policy terms and tackle any ambiguities. The most obvious is the wholesale adoption of one country’s definition or another’s; however, deciding which one to use risks becoming an involved process requiring justificatory criteria or a quick but arbitrary decision with an uncertain rationale. Neither method is very helpful. Another approach is to define state threats either very narrowly or very broadly, alternatively excluding or including all problematic categories. However, both approaches have significant weaknesses; the former risks ignoring many relevant hostile behaviours and actors, and the latter risks bringing a vast and undifferentiated spectrum of state and non-state activities into scope. Consequently, some pragmatism is required in developing a working definition of what we mean by state threats that does not dilute the essential qualities in existing policy definitions while also providing a workable scope for investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overt or covert&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The centre of gravity in Western government thinking is that state threats largely consist of covert and clandestine activities, although the UK also explicitly includes overt acts. Economy, simplicity and the weight of policy opinion suggest that excluding overt acts might be appropriate; however, doing so could potentially omit episodic and blatant acts of semi-covert or overt hostility that only seem to differ from covert hostile acts by a matter of degree, and which, moreover, often occur as one ingredient alongside covert activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question then arises which types of overt statecraft should be included or excluded. The acceptability of various overt activities under international law or custom is open to broad interpretation, even when states concur on the letter of the law or the usual pattern of practice. Furthermore, some policy tools that Western states regard as entirely legitimate are dismissed by others, including those that are not necessarily Western adversaries. For instance, India sees Western use of autonomous economic and financial sanctions outside the UN framework as inappropriate. Including overt acts that any state might deem unacceptable or illegitimate, without any qualification, would thus create a definition that is so broad as to become meaningless and would also encompass Western statecraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, several potential dividing lines might be drawn. Some overt hostile activities are explicitly banned; wars of aggression, for example. Others are explicitly permitted under international law in response to other states’ hostile and illegal actions, such as enforcing freedom of navigation in international waterways if a blockade is attempted, for instance. Moreover, other actions, such as the imposition of autonomous sanctions, are not illegal and are direct reflections of measures that the international community itself uses through the UN Security Council. While some states might question the rights of states to apply them without UN endorsement, they do not question the idea of sanctions as a tool of policy in themselves. These kinds of measures do at least bear the imprimatur of some international acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In between these poles, however, lies a zone of activities that are neither explicitly endorsed nor prohibited by international law and practice; peacetime espionage, for example. Sifting the acceptable from the unacceptable within this zone is a difficult matter, given the diversity of states’ legal, moral and cultural norms. What “feels” right for one country might not in another. However, some potential rules of thumb might establish whether a state’s overt behaviours could be deemed less acceptable as peacetime conduct, especially when used in conjunction with covert hostile acts. These are behaviours that, in effect, go against the intended spirit of the rules, if not their precise letter, and comprise:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;extreme behaviours&lt;/strong&gt; that push acceptable forms of statecraft to the very edge of international practice, such as the use of physical threats in diplomacy; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;subversive behaviours&lt;/strong&gt; that distort, infringe or manipulate rules and norms with antisocial behaviours, such as seeking to redraw international boundaries without consent, or using international tools and institutions in dishonest or misleading ways.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is a rough heuristic for drawing lines between acceptable and unacceptable behaviours, it is probably through the pragmatic application of these criteria, imprecise though they may be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The importance of intent&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On matters of intent common sense suggests that a desire to harm is an essential component of a hostile act. Sins of omission or neglect can be damaging and dangerous, but they are rarely viewed as threats. A doctor whose mistake results in a patient’s death may be accused of negligence or possibly manslaughter, but likely not murder. Additionally, the development of an interstate dependency that may later be exploited cannot be considered a hostile act without substantive evidence to suggest that it is intended as such from the outset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the need to demonstrate intent to harm as a guide, it is therefore justifiable to exclude purely negligent state behaviours and the formation of international dependencies from the scope of state threats in most cases. However, their potential for weaponisation remains a latent issue states must be aware of. Both categories of behaviour have the potential to be misused at some point and could therefore be regarded as pathways by which hostile actions might emerge in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The importance of responsibility&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the same logic, the acts of non-state actors with links to states cannot be included or excluded as a whole. Intermediate criteria need to be applied to assess the quality of evidence of operational engagement between state and non-state actors, and the likely alignment of their intentions. Where non-state actors undertake hostile activities that are aligned with a group’s own agenda and not with that of the linked state actor, go against the wishes of that state actor, and generate little dividend for or cause harm to that state actor’s interests, such activities should not be treated as hostile state actions, regardless of existing operational links between the actors involved. To see a non-state actor’s activity as a form of hostile state threat, credible evidence needs to show not only a relationship or operational entanglement between the actors, but also reasonable grounds to believe that the non-state actor’s actions are undertaken because of that relationship, and with the involvement, encouragement or approval of the state actor. If these provisos are not in place, states become hostages to the actions of any actor that deems itself to be an instrument of that state’s interests, regardless of the views or actions of the state itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, finding convincing evidence to meet these criteria is much easier to propose than to achieve, and it may create uncertainties about how to categorise the behaviour of certain non-state actors. However, it is safer to base policy on credible evidence – even if it is open to different interpretations – rather than on external assumptions regarding the political allegiances of states and non-state actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The working model&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using these heuristics and judgements, the research establishes a new definition of state threats that synthesises the most prevalent elements of existing definitions and delineates pragmatic boundaries in areas of uncertainty. It seeks to flesh out the existing understanding of the term state threats based on the four core criteria initially identified:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Severity of the threat&lt;/strong&gt;: It is a hostile act that fall short of the internationally defined nature of war, and/or distort and subvert peacetime international rules and norms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The source of the threat&lt;/strong&gt;: It is initiated or encouraged by a state actor and executed by a state or non-state actor for a state actor’s purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The character of the threat&lt;/strong&gt;: It is underhand and undermining (covert, deceptive, corrupt, illegal, coercive or threatening) or abuses accepted rules and norms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The motivation of the threat&lt;/strong&gt;: It intentionally or knowingly damages another state’s (or other states’) interests and assets for political purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As readers will surmise, this definition is still a working model and edge cases will challenge it. Nevertheless, it is a useful framework for analysis and broadly aligns with the underlying sense of state threats expressed in various Western policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications&quot;&gt;Implications&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research demonstrates that policymakers face challenges in defining and outlining the scope and nature of hostile state activities. Very little about these activities fits neatly within established conceptual policy boundaries. Although careful analysis can achieve a workable level of coherence, some ambiguity of meaning is unavoidable. The underlying tension the research reveals – between the need for comprehensiveness and the need for clarity – may be the fundamental problem Western governments face as they develop an appropriate set of policy responses to state threats. The research does not seek to resolve that tension by proposing detailed policy recommendations. However, its findings do have implications for the assumptions and perspectives policymakers will need as they formulate responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;observation-1-recognise-the-redundancy-of-the-peacewar-dichotomy&quot;&gt;Observation 1: Recognise the redundancy of the peace/war dichotomy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although terms such as hybrid threats and grey zone conflict do not fully capture the issue that Western governments face, they highlight important aspects of how major state actors are thinking and acting. Russia, China, Iran and others have indeed used hostile actions that blend unusual and novel techniques while navigating the legal and ethical boundaries that Western governments have established in international relations. As Kilcullen points out, Russia and China have aimed to test the West vertically, by pushing hostile actions to the brink of armed conflict, and horizontally, by expanding various forms of hostile actions into unexpected areas such as illegal migration. For Western governments and international organisations that prioritise clear legal boundaries and due process, state threats therefore present significant challenges in framing appropriate and timely responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This suggests that Western countries need to reconsider whether the clear peace/war dichotomy they follow still makes sense when their opponents are willing to ignore the boundary between them. It further suggests that Western countries need to adopt a more imaginative approach to identifying the sectors from which threats might emerge and in what combinations, as well as how they might respond. The research shows that there is an intermediate “zone” of unacceptable behaviours between peace and war that might be better seen as a distinct category – “conflict”, perhaps – and therefore, it behoves Western states to recognise this and recalibrate how they respond in ways that are commensurate to the level of action taken by their opponents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;observation-2-create-clear-but-flexible-definitions-within-which-to-frame-policy-responses&quot;&gt;Observation 2: Create clear but flexible definitions within which to frame policy responses&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research notes that no matter how fluid the policy problem governments face – and as noted, state threats are among the most fluid and amorphous – without a workable definition of the problem being targeted, responses will potentially fail. If the parameters of the challenge are set too wide, policy responses risk becoming diffuse and uncoordinated; if they are set too narrowly, important aspects of the problem will be neglected. The task is to address the essential aspects of the problem; in the probably apocryphal words attributed to Albert Einstein: “Things should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Achieving this presents a challenge, and it is quite possible that the most parsimonious approach to defining the problem will still generate a vast array of issues to address. As the research indicates, this is probably the case with state threats, encompassing diverse areas such as espionage, sabotage, intimidation and subversion. Unlike a phenomenon such as terrorism, the one common theme behind these various threats is not the type of hostile act employed, but rather the core source of the threat: a state actor. State threats thus resemble a many-headed hydra, with numerous interlinked hostile acts emerging from singular sources – the states themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do Western governments manage this problem? Again, the research does not provide answers at this point, but it does offer areas for further consideration. Having a broad categorisation of state threats does not prevent governments from developing subcategories of interconnected aspects of the problem that might be dealt with in policy “clusters”, which make sense based on patterns of behaviour seen in available intelligence. For example, human espionage and malign influence campaigns can be closely connected, and many of the most violent activities in transnational repression and physical sabotage use similar methods and involve similar perpetrators. These clusters within the overall policy framework could themselves be prioritised; policy problems within each distinct cluster could then also be prioritised. How the prioritisation process would work in practice would need to be decided on, but one obvious technique of risk management would be to consider criteria such as the likelihood or regularity of specific threats, their potential impact, and the level of the state’s resilience or vulnerability to those threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;observation-3-recognise-the-importance-of-access-to-and-sharing-of-intelligence-and-expertise&quot;&gt;Observation 3: Recognise the importance of access to and sharing of intelligence and expertise&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research further suggests that governments must have access to reliable intelligence, suitable tools and relevant human expertise to be able to identify and respond to state threats, particularly when attributing responsibility to the partners and proxies of state actors in ambiguous edge cases. The most fundamental – and, unfortunately, least effective – observation here is that departments and agencies require adequate resources and tools, and appropriate levels of expertise in relevant domains and geographies. To some extent, many Western governments are relatively well-positioned in this regard already due to the high competence and knowledge of their diplomatic personnel, and intelligence and security agencies. However, in many Western states, government departments and agencies are severely under-resourced in relevant linguistic and cultural expertise concerning perpetrator states and, in some cases, in technical expertise in areas such as cyber and disinformation. Without these, governments will find tackling diverse challenges such as state threats much harder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The place of partnerships&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These observations are not, however, merely intended to prompt greater investment in more resources; they also emphasise the need for Western governments to adopt a more flexible approach to gathering and accessing intelligence and expertise. The research indicates that much policy, intelligence and investigative work related to state threats remains siloed within governments. As always, in this situation, links, overlaps and common patterns of behaviour by malicious actors in seemingly different domains go unnoticed and unaddressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This problem can be partly mitigated through more flexible intelligence-sharing protocols among departments and agencies, and closer collaboration and joint efforts in areas where disparate threats share common origins, such as when non-state actors in organised crime operate on behalf of states. In such cases, intelligence, security and law enforcement agencies must work together closely. This necessity extends to establishing broader international partnerships, including bilateral and multilateral security collaborations, where allies and partners possess insights and access that individual states may lack. Furthermore, enhancing access to intelligence and expertise involves ensuring that governments use intelligence from the private sector effectively. This does not imply altering the law in a manner similar to China, which mandates that private enterprises support and facilitate state and party covert operations. Rather, it entails leveraging work already being performed by private actors in sectors with existing statutory responsibilities to gather and act on intelligence; for example, in the financial services sector, or fields where there is a practical need to comprehend high-risk environments, including logistics, energy, and metals and mining. Here, intelligence sharing and joint working can pay substantial dividends, as initiatives such as the UK’s Joint Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce have already demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;observation-4-create-a-flexible-but-proportionate-toolkit-of-policy-responses&quot;&gt;Observation 4: Create a flexible but proportionate toolkit of policy responses&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An obvious corollary of facing a fluid set of interconnected threats and being willing to reconsider international legal distinctions is the need for a flexible policy toolkit. If Western governments are to demonstrate greater agility, flexibility and creativity in addressing the zone of conflict in which state threats are occurring, they need more options than they currently allow themselves or have already considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As suggested in the research, much of the current Western response is based on a “resilience model”, which aims to soak up and remain unaffected by hostile acts, in effect waiting for the hostile acts to end. However, in taking this stance, Western governments assume that they will be able to withstand the effects of the long-term attrition involved, and that hostile actions will stop before they cause major or existential damage. They might be right in this, but it is an optimistic perspective that leaves much to chance. Governments also appear to assume that they have limited options available to affect the calculations of the attackers themselves. Although options to undertake disruptive and even offensive measures in areas such as cyber effects operations exist, options which might change attackers’ calculations, research suggests that their use remains relatively limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These observations should not be interpreted as a plea for Western governments to take an “anything goes” approach to responding to state threats. Legality, ethical principles, necessity and proportionality should remain foundational to Western responses, and governments might consider how to shape wider international standards of behaviour through existing diplomatic channels. Assertive diplomacy in multilateral and “minilateral” forums might kickstart discussions about international standards in non-military conflict, starting with the long-term dialogue around the use of cyberspace, then expanding to cover the role and scope of espionage, sabotage and subversion outside periods of traditionally defined war. Although these efforts are unlikely to gain immediate traction with the most aggressive “revisionist states” such as Russia or North Korea, they may offer a nucleus of consensus that could help to provide a barrier to the proliferation of hostile activities in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;observation-5-remain-alert-and-be-aware-of-dependencies-and-vulnerabilities-in-a-rapidly-changing-world&quot;&gt;Observation 5: Remain alert and be aware of dependencies and vulnerabilities in a rapidly changing world&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the research indicates the need to be aware of potential changes in the scale, scope and nature of state threats. The emergence of new state actors, techniques and methods of attack must be monitored, along with changing contexts – economic, political and social – that could influence how hostile actions occur and what their potential impacts might be. One of the most important areas governments should focus on is the impact of technology, particularly advances in artificial intelligence, robotics and quantum computing, and how they might make acts of intimidation and sabotage – or worse – easier to undertake, more dangerous and potentially more deniable. Additionally, governments need to pay attention to the potential weaponisation of domestic issues of targeted states, and the exploitation of dependencies and vulnerabilities. Western governments must fully understand their levels of interconnectedness and interdependence not only with competitors and opponents, but also with significant non-aligned “middle powers”, as well as allies and partners. As noted above, while strategic dependence on other states may not be a state threat per se, it has the potential to become so if unexpected geopolitical realignments occur. As the current policy disagreements between the US and its allies indicate, this risk can never be wholly discounted.&lt;/p&gt;

But to distinguish itself from previous initiatives, UKDI needs resources and a cultural shift to deliver innovation at scale and speed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To “harness tech for the UK’s Armed Forces”, the UK Ministry of Defence launched UK Defence Innovation (UKDI) on 1 July. This is not the first time a body under the MoD is tasked with enhancing innovation and securing cutting-edge technology for UK defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why the perceived need for yet another new body? Because innovating in defence remains hard: Hierarchical military organisations require a top-down approach. And while in the commercial world, small companies can disrupt well-established business models, defence remains a conservative sector. Disruption by innovators championing radical and untried approaches clash with a system in which most civil servants and military personnel are not incentivised to take risk – an inherent factor of innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the difficulties of sharing sensitive information makes it difficult for companies to enter the defence sector. Once in, long project timelines that can take around five to six years from bid to delivery are longer than typical investment and financing cycles of start-ups and SMEs – they may be out of business by the time the first payments come through. For investors, this makes start-ups with a defence application a difficult value proposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;taking-inspiration-from-the-us-defense-innovation-unit&quot;&gt;Taking Inspiration from the US Defense Innovation Unit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New approaches are needed to tackle persistent challenges for innovation in defence. The exemplary model comes from the US, where in 2015, the US DoD created a “Defense Innovation Unit” (DIU). Known to be a “significant driver” of innovation and a successful bridge between the Pentagon and Silicon Valley, DIU has effectively been seen as an embassy for US defence among tech companies developing innovative tech capabilities in Silicon Valley or other innovation hubs, linking into these communities to identify interesting capabilities. The US DIU uses Commercial Solutions Opening (CSO) processes to contract with tech companies to rapidly prototype relevant technologies, aiming for 60-90 days and averaging 120 days to award prototype agreements - a stark contrast to the slow procurement cycles that typically shape the US acquisition process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not just the process, also the culture shapes DIU’s success. This includes attracting top talent from the civil service and tech industry and providing a work culture that incentivises taking risks. The DIU enjoys support form senior military and political leaders and the Defence Innovation Board recommended in January 2025 to further expand DIU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past 10 years, institutions of similar names and nature have been mushrooming across Europe. Their aim is to unite technology developers and the military end-users, to create more awareness of the potential of technology with the military forces and signal to investors which technologies are the most interesting to them. The technological innovations seen in the Russo-Ukrainian war have further highlighted their advantages in combat and catalysed innovation activities across Europe. And the increased NATO spending targets mean that there is money to invest in and accelerate defence innovation and technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-uks-new-innovation-ecosphere&quot;&gt;The UK’s New Innovation Ecosphere&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the recent years, the UK has looked to model the US success. In its Strategic Defence Review (SDR), the government has recognised that defence innovation is “vital to stay ahead of our adversaries”. Indeed, the SDR goes as far as to call for defence to be “innovation led” and proposes a “radical root-and-branch reform of defence procurement – combined with substantial investment in innovation”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 1 July, MoD launched the defence innovation unit endorsed in the SDR, the UK Defence Innovation (UKDI), tasked with accelerating innovation for UK defence and security. However, UKDI is not the first organisation tackling this challenge in the UK. There is a wide network of innovation hubs, centres, and task forces pre-dating the SDR, dealing with the innovation challenge in defence – an issue that has long been on the agenda for UK defence secretaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These initiatives sit at various levels of the MoD’s organisation and beyond, spanning from frontline commands, the MoD’s head office to Dstl, DE&amp;amp;S, the Department for Business and Trade, and UKRI. At these various levels, they fulfil different tasks. Some are focused on enabling the military end-user to speak with product developers directly, some act more as start-up incubators to attract inward investments, while others seek to connect state-funded research programmes with the right companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scattered landscape of innovation units has been argued to lack the necessary strategic direction to unite their various innovation ambitions into a coherent approach that can deliver meaningful change to how the MoD approaches innovation as a whole and delivers it at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address this, the government has announced a “strategic consolidation” of the landscape by providing an umbrella organisation for all these innovation hubs: UK Defence Innovation (UKDI). Within the purview of Strategic Command, now renamed Cyber &amp;amp; Specialist Operations Command, the new unit “brings together” several existing initiatives such as DASA, DIU, the DE&amp;amp;S FCI and Frontline Commands’ units. The description of UKDI as an “umbrella” leaves room for interpretation. The most direct line of responsibility concerns DASA, as the accelerator will be “an integral part of UKDI”. The nature of the relationship with the other innovation units will get clearer over time, with UKDI aiming to be fully operational by 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;critical-success-factors-for-ukdi&quot;&gt;Critical Success Factors for UKDI&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the private sector, start-ups and investors, greater cohesion and a strategic outlook are welcome measures, providing a clear point of contact and a more consolidated demand signal. So, is the UKDI such a centralised, true hub for all MoD innovation initiatives? The funding that it will command suggests that. The government announced that UKDI will have a ringfenced £400 million annual budget. It is easy to demand more money – something even the US counterpart faces - but hard to secure in tight economic constraints. If this constitutes a genuinely new and dedicated budget, this means that UKDI will do more than just control DASA, which has awarded significantly less per year in the past. That hints to a lead role of UKDI in innovation across its organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a shift comes with challenges and risks. UKDI will need to pool the expertise that resides across the various sections of the organisation to be successful. This can put it at odds with those parts of the organisation that need to give up that expertise. The creation of the National Armament Director position and the formation of a new Military Strategic Headquarters show that there is ample political appetite for centralising defence structures. But centralisation can also be a threat to innovation. Independent hubs may be able to explore different ideas and solutions with different developers and producers. When there is too much emphasis on coordination, there is also a risk of creating path dependencies across the organisation. Independent hubs, while wasteful, can avoid those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, centralisation may help with some of the harder tasks any innovation organisation faces when it comes to MoD procurement practice. This practice has evolved to minimise risks for the MoD and the taxpayer. Civil servants are incentivised to follow this process, and there are few with an interest in inducing flexibility in that system for innovation’s sake. An organisation with more budgetary might and at the heart of the MoD’s structure may be better positioned to campaign for the necessary changes to make that process more permissive for innovation. The challenge will be to allow wastage within the UKDI ecosystem of hubs that can create innovation for the Frontline Commands’ specific needs while utilising the power of a united innovation platform to address common problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, a central innovation entity may enable a broader definition of innovation that goes beyond putting a shiny new toy in the hands of a special forces soldier. Harnessing tech for UK armed forces necessarily also means making the most out of technology for the infrastructure behind the warfighting soldiers: whether that is coordinating logistics, streamlining reporting duties or easing the administrative burden – there are more ways in which technology can empower UK armed forces beyond the battle line. UKDI must identify technological solutions that empower not just the few, but the UK Armed Forces as a whole. The new unit’s success will be judged on its ability to deliver such innovative capabilities at a large scale and within shorter timeframes than its predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the wake of Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion, Ukraine’s military and political leadership faced the grim reality that its Soviet-inherited defense industrial base was riddled with corruption, institutional inertia, and a closed culture. Yet this legacy sector, despite its dysfunction, remained indispensable to Ukraine’s survival in the face of an existential threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What followed was not a slow reform but a wartime transformation. In just three years, Ukraine has cultivated a defense technology ecosystem focused on unmanned systems that is agile and competitive. This report, based on dozens of interviews with Ukrainian officials, entrepreneurs, and military officers, tells the story of how this shift occurred under the extreme pressures of war. More importantly, it draws out the central lesson for the United States and its allies: Any serious effort to prepare for the wars of the future must incorporate options for radical decentralization, bottom-up innovation, and competitive dynamism within the defense industrial base. The Ukrainian case is not conclusive, but it is a crucial example of how free societies should adapt their defense sectors to meet modern threats with speed, agility, and technological ingenuity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-findings&quot;&gt;Key Findings&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukraine institutionalized a distinct “commercial-first” defense market focused primarily on innovative systems—such as unmanned platforms—by carving out a separate and parallel budget within defense spending and radically simplifying and reducing onerous acquisition rules for this market.&lt;/strong&gt; Rather than relying on its legacy military-industrial complex for innovative capabilities development, Ukraine turned to the commercial sector. The country allocated a dedicated portion of its defense budget for acquiring new capabilities, originating from commercial sector and established a new regulatory framework to enable rapid acquisition and integration of unmanned technologies from nontraditional vendors. This transformation included establishing streamlined electronic procurement procedures and decentralizing procurement authority all the way down to the level of independent military units (discussed further in point 7).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukraine’s commercial-first market focused on unmanned and software-intensive military technologies.&lt;/strong&gt; The commercial-first market was originally focused almost exclusively on commercial drones. This proved to be incredibly effective, and the market’s scope has expanded significantly since the full-scale invasion began. The primary scope now includes unmanned systems—such as first-person view (FPV) and long-range strike drones and ground and naval unmanned vehicles—alongside electronic warfare and electronic reconnaissance platforms, advanced sensors, secure communications, and artificial intelligence (AI)–enabled software modules for autonomous navigation and target recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commercial technology—mostly unmanned systems—now accounts for nearly half of Ukraine’s defense procurement spending.&lt;/strong&gt; Based on state budget allocations alone, commercial sector acquisitions comprise nearly one-third of total spending on weapon systems. When factoring in reallocated funds from local budgets and volunteer-supported procurement, this share approaches half of all defense acquisition spending—demonstrating that in a modern, high-intensity conflict, commercially developed technologies can play a significant and beneficial role.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukraine adapted and aligned its unmanned capability acquisition process to the commercial product development lifecycle.&lt;/strong&gt; At every stage of the product development lifecycle, the Ukrainian government worked to remove unnecessary procedures, decision milestones, and oversight mechanisms. It adapted its acquisition processes to more closely align with how drones are developed and acquired in the commercial context. Ukraine adapted regulatory and funding mechanisms to support this model, ensuring that timelines, language, and expectations between government and industry were aligned and grounded in warfighting necessity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukraine ensured military requirements for unmanned systems were defined in terms of real-world problems by end users, not rigid technical specifications coming from top-down planning.&lt;/strong&gt; Ukraine’s experience shows that frontline-driven problem identification leads to faster, more relevant solutions. Instead of relying on bureaucratic forecasting of requirements, Ukrainian units communicate their needs and experiences directly to engineers through informal channels of personal connections or events such as hackathons and challenges. By framing requirements as operational challenges rather than technical blueprints, the military encourages more creative responses from industry and widens the pool of potential suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukraine fully outsourced early-stage research and development (R&amp;amp;D) to the commercial sector, meaning drone manufacturers independently fund and develop technologies up to the prototype stage—typically reaching status as a minimum viable product(MVP) or technology readiness level (TRL) 6–7—before the military starts to engage with the technology.&lt;/strong&gt; In Ukraine, the military does not get involved in the earliest stages of developing new drones. Instead, private companies use their own money to design and build early versions of the technology. By the time the military sees it, the drone is already a working prototype, ready to be tested in real battlefield conditions. This means the military can focus on testing and using promising technologies, not funding or managing their initial development. This approach shifts the burden of early experimentation and funding to private industry, speeds up innovation through direct feedback from end users, and allows the military to focus its resources on testing, integration, and rapid deployment of promising solutions—ensuring that only mature technologies enter the defense evaluation pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukraine heavily decentralized its defense procurement of unmanned capabilities, including by giving military units procurement authority and budgets to buy systems they need directly from a list approved by the Ministry of Defence (MOD).&lt;/strong&gt; These changes allow the units to bypass traditional annual procurement planning, enabling them to use funds available on their accounts—either directly transferred from the state budget or reallocated from local government resources—to acquire urgently needed technologies. This shift enables faster, more responsive acquisition tailored to the real-time needs of frontline operations, enhancing operational adaptability and reducing reliance on centralized bureaucratic processes. By comparison, operational military units in the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) receive budgets for uses such as paying soldiers and funding operations and maintenance, but not procuring military systems and equipment, a role that is compartmentalized within individual military services or the Office of the Secretary of Defense.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secure and encrypted digital communication tools transformed military capability development by streamlining the communication of military needs to industry, replacing paperwork with fast digital processes and connecting military end users directly with drone developers.&lt;/strong&gt; Building on its success in digital governance, Ukraine has begun applying the same approach to its defense sector. Although a unified digital acquisition system is still evolving, digitization already accelerates prototyping, streamlines evaluation, and brings the military and industry into real-time collaboration. These tools allow the armed forces to quickly and securely communicate battlefield needs, evaluate solutions, and procure technology directly—laying the foundation for a more agile and responsive defense innovation system.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the most immediate and visible crisis was the existential military threat—tanks rolling across the border and a possibility of immediate occupation of the whole country. Yet beneath this emergency lay a deeper, more protracted crisis that both predated the invasion and critically shaped Ukraine’s ability to respond to it: decades of horrific mismanagement of Ukraine’s defense industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a cornerstone of mighty Soviet military production, Ukraine’s defense industry had, by the time of the invasion, become a shell of its former self—plagued by corruption, outdated technologies, incompetent management, inefficient corporate governance, and severe technological gaps. Some of the attempted solutions to these problems—such as extensive regulatory rules and oversight to reduce corruption and mismanagement—had exacerbated other problems, such as cultural insularity and institutional sclerosis. These structural deficiencies posed a huge obstacle to producing weapons and innovative military technologies at scale. In effect, Ukraine faced the near-impossible task of overhauling its deeply troubled defense industrial system amid a full-scale war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remarkably, Ukraine managed to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three years out from the invasion, Ukraine now boasts an innovative defense technology sector that is in many ways the envy of Western countries with far larger military budgets and digital technology industries. A growing body of analysis has explored how Ukraine’s defense ecosystem evolved in wartime conditions by turning to commercial- and startup-driven innovation and leveraging decentralized acquisition strategies. Researchers have examined how Ukraine adapts to constantly evolving strategic and operational challenges faster than many traditional militaries, citing successes like the use of maritime drones to eliminate Russia’s Black Sea naval blockade. Others have focused on how Ukraine’s iterative approach to testing and deployment, showcased in technologies like the situational awareness system Delta, offers lessons in accelerating defense innovation and absorbing battlefield feedback in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report—the result of dozens of interviews with Ukrainian government officials, corporate executives, and military personnel—seeks to tell the still mostly unknown story of how Ukraine accomplished this remarkable turnaround and provide lessons learned for the U.S. Department of Defense in unleashing drone dominance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how did Ukraine do it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somewhat surprisingly, the main arc of Ukraine’s story is not one of rapid transformation of legacy defense companies (though some of this did occur). Rather, Ukraine’s leaders sidestepped many reform challenges by creating two parallel defense budget and acquisition systems that operated separately and simultaneously: one for traditional companies and traditional systems, and another for commercially derived capabilities, mostly for unmanned systems. At the time, demand for all kinds of equipment and capabilities—both traditional military kit and commercial technology—was soaring amid the largest war in Europe since World War II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s leaders correctly concluded that the traditional defense industrial base could not be relied upon to rapidly acquire or develop drones. Major defense contractors, such as Ukroboronprom, lacked the capabilities, knowhow, and talent pool to scale production of attritable drones even remotely approaching the quality and quantity of what was readily available on the commercial market. At the same time, however, the commercial sector could not, in a realistic timeframe, emerge as a viable alternative for traditional military production of materiel such as tanks, missiles, aircraft, and artillery. These complex, capital-intensive systems require long-term investment, certified production facilities, and specialized engineering talent—capabilities the commercial sector simply could not deliver at scale or speed in the midst of full-scale war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;literature-review&quot;&gt;Literature Review&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent analytical work casts Ukraine as a model of agile industrial governance and commercial-sector mobilization. The U.S. Naval Institute wrote that Ukraine’s use of commercial drones underscores the strategic value of agility in adopting new technologies, and field researchers from the Royal United Services Institute documented two-month loops from frontline need to mass-produced FPV drones. The Atlantic Council has further emphasized Ukraine’s ability to outpace more established militaries in adopting and fielding emerging technologies, crediting its vibrant tech sector and unusually fast procurement cycles and suggesting that Ukraine offers NATO allies important lessons in twenty-first-century warfare. Importantly, this research treats Ukraine’s wartime mobilization not as an anomaly born of desperation, but as a controlled experiment in modern defense acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These reports and broader literature point to transformative efforts across three dimensions: (1) budgetary changes, (2) transformation of processes across capability development lifecycle, and (3) digital communication channels. On the fiscal front, the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) documented the dramatic growth of Ukraine’s defense industrial output from $1 billion in 2022 to an expected $15 billion in 2025, and the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute highlighted Kyiv’s decision to allocate 34 percent of its GDP to defense in 2024. In parallel, the U.S. Naval Institute and Atlantic Council both pointed to a transformed development lifecycle, where frontline demand drives rapid iteration and mass production of military systems. Finally, CEPA and VoxUkraine each discussed how digital platforms such as Brave1 demonstrate how Ukraine has embedded transparency and cross-sector coordination into its acquisition ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This growing body of research provides the conceptual and empirical foundation for this report’s analytical approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;research-design&quot;&gt;Research Design&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report advances the argument that two distinct acquisition systems—one focused on traditional hardware-intensive platforms and another oriented toward commercial-first software-centric capabilities—can and should coexist within modern defense acquisition systems. Ukraine’s wartime experience with drone acquisition provides empirical evidence that a dual-track model is not only viable but necessary to meet the diverse demands of contemporary military operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While conventional defense industrial bases (DIBs) may eventually be forced to adapt to the tempo and innovation cycles of commercial technology development, Ukraine demonstrates that new acquisition systems for commercial technologies, such as unmanned systems, can function effectively in parallel with traditional acquisition pathways even during existential conflict. This parallel structure enables military organizations to exploit the advantages of both legacy and agile ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To explore this argument, the report uses Ukraine as a crucial case study for drawing broader lessons for the United States and its allies. Ukraine’s wartime adaptation provides a rare real-world laboratory to observe institutional transformation under extreme conditions. Unlike theoretical models or peacetime pilots, Ukraine’s innovations in defense acquisition are battlefield tested. The insights presented here are based on over 50 in-depth interviews conducted in 2024 and 2025 with Ukrainian Armed Forces personnel, MOD officials, defense startup founders, commercial drone manufacturers, and U.S. stakeholders, including members of combatant commands, program executive offices (PEOs), and commercial defense companies and venture capital funds. This dual perspective grounds the analysis in both practitioner experience and comparative institutional context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report analyzes the drivers of Ukraine’s transformation across three analytical dimensions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Budgetary Changes:&lt;/strong&gt; Ukraine’s innovation model is rooted in structural shifts to its defense budget. By creating a dedicated funding stream for unmanned systems acquisition outside the traditional defense acquisition system—managed by an alternative agency—Ukraine enabled faster, more flexible procurement of commercial technologies. This budgetary dualism allowed the government to reorient priorities away from an inefficient legacy defense-industrial base and toward battlefield-driven innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transformation of Processes Across the Capability Development Lifecycle:&lt;/strong&gt; Ukraine departed from the rigid, linear acquisition model common to many militaries and instead adopted a product development framework aligned with commercial practices. This transformation included decentralizing procurement authority, enabling unit-level purchases, accelerating prototyping and field testing, and integrating frontline feedback into procurement cycles. In doing so, Ukraine replaced paper-based, multiyear bureaucracies with a nimble and iterative approach suited to the fast-evolving battlefield environment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digital Communication Channels:&lt;/strong&gt; A crucial enabler of Ukraine’s transformation was the digitization of the defense innovation ecosystem. Ukraine constructed real-time digital interfaces connecting warfighters, engineers, and government institutions, such as the Brave1 coordination platform, the DOT-Chain weapons marketplace, and Army+ app feedback tools. These interfaces provided visibility into operational needs and technological performance, helping to reduce corruption, improve responsiveness, and maintain alignment between end users and producers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these three dimensions is examined in depth in the report, using Ukraine as an empirical test case for assessing the feasibility and utility of commercial-first innovation pathways in defense. Based on this analysis, the report distills lessons learned from Ukraine and offers policy recommendations for the U.S. Department of Defense as it seeks to modernize its own acquisition system. The Ukrainian case is not a one-to-one template, but a source of tested insights that can help shape reforms in a more deliberate, scalable, and institutionally integrated manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lessons Learned from Ukraine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To institutionalize commercial drones’ acquisition, Ukraine created a dedicated budget outside of the MOD’s acquisition and procurement budget.&lt;/strong&gt; In 2023, the government allocated separate funding specifically for procuring unmanned systems from the commercial sector and empowered the State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection (SSSCIP) to oversee it. This step was supported by a distinct set of procurement rules established by the cabinet of ministers to accelerate purchasing drones from the commercial market. This shift ensured that military customers had direct access to funding and could engage flexibly with nontraditional suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As of 2025, nearly one-third of all defense procurement spending is directed toward commercial innovation, with major portion allocated to unmanned systems.&lt;/strong&gt; With over 165 billion UAH allocated for capabilities developed outside the traditional defense-industrial base (see Dimension 1 analysis below), Ukraine has fundamentally reoriented its acquisition strategy toward a more agile, decentralized, and innovation-driven model.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Procurement authority has been decentralized to the unit level, enabling faster and more localized procurement and adoption of unmanned systems.&lt;/strong&gt; The MOD tests and evaluates the systems, then adopts them into service, making them available for purchase by military units. Almost 700 frontline units are now authorized to purchase critical systems directly from commercial vendors, using funds drawn from both central government allocations and flexible transfers from local authorities. This structure allows for responsive bottom-up acquisition based on operational needs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As a result, private companies fully fund early-stage R&amp;amp;D, while the government incentivizes success through fast-track procurement.&lt;/strong&gt; Without access to public funding, firms take on the risk of developing drone prototypes on their own. Once a solution proves viable, the military adopts it rapidly—often purchasing it at market price before final refinements—creating a strong feedback loop that rewards speed, effectiveness, and adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Ukraine urgently needed to acquire innovative capabilities from domestic commercial firms, startups, and select foreign vendors, it became immediately clear to government officials that traditional defense budgeting mechanisms were an obstacle. Existing budgeting processes relied on multiyear planning cycles, where even the most basic procurement could take one or two years to materialize. The country needed a system capable of mobilizing funds quickly and ensuring their flexible usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowhere was this disconnect more apparent than with novel unmanned systems. For example, a commercial FPV drone, despite its widespread use on the battlefield and growing lethality, could not be purchased through official channels because it had no name in military nomenclature. The bureaucratic machinery, bound by legacy classification and documentation systems, lacked even the vocabulary to describe what the frontlines urgently demanded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, to solve the problem of urgently supplying drones to the frontline, diverse and mostly ad hoc groups of volunteers organized grassroots crowdfunding campaigns, both domestically and internationally. While these efforts played an essential role during the early stages of the war, they were stopgap measures, not a long-term solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is more important for this analysis is the institutional solution Ukraine ultimately adopted to create an agile acquisition process of unmanned capabilities from the commercial sector: the creation of a separate budget, distinct from the conventional defense acquisition funding and procurement system, governed by its own rules and procedures. While this section of the report focuses on the structure of the wartime defense budget changes, the new procedural approach will be explored in greater detail later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysis of the budgetary shifts first requires an understanding of Ukraine’s defense acquisition budget structure. Currently, it consists of three major budget programs through which defense spending is conducted for new capabilities acquisition. Each budget program functions as a separate budget, administered by a distinct agency operating under its own regulations and procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to acknowledge that the spending figures and categories provided in this report are taken from the Ukrainian state budget, but do not precisely reflect all nuances of military spending. This is due to two primary factors. First, a significant portion of military expenditures remain classified, making it exceptionally difficult to determine which specific line items fall within each budget program. Second, the unpredictable nature of wartime operations requires the government to frequently reallocate funds or initiate new spending outside the original budget approved by the parliament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, a broad conceptual mapping remains both possible and useful for understanding the deeper budgetary shifts that have occurred, and how they have enabled Ukraine to respond with speed and flexibility to the challenges of wartime acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/7Jv0KlH.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: Comparing the Three Budget Programs for Defense Acquisition Funding&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before 2020, the MOD was the only government body defining operational requirements, since it was the sole acquisition authority for the armed forces. This centralized structure positioned the MOD as the only customer and interlocutor with the state-owned defense-industrial complex, which was organized under the umbrella of the Ukrainian Defense Industry, or Ukroboronprom (UOP)—a state-owned defense conglomerate uniting financially interdependent Soviet-era enterprises under centralized management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Defence owned the first acquisition budget and conducted acquisition efforts using a single budget program titled “Development, procurement, modernization, and repair of weapons, military equipment, means, and systems.” This program functioned as the principal vehicle for the R&amp;amp;D, procurement, operations, and sustainment of arms and materiel, all from one funding source. Despite institutional reforms initiated in the years that followed, this budget program remains the primary mechanism through which the military executes defense procurement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Ukraine has been in a protracted state of war since 2014. For almost a decade of the ongoing war, the Soviet-legacy military industrial base proved to be not only deeply corrupt but also fundamentally incapable of generating innovative, particularly unmanned and software-centric, defense technologies to fight and deter Russia. The Ukrainian government tried to address this problem by creating a dedicated body to boost defense-industrial modernization, and in 2020, the cabinet of ministers established the Ministry of Strategic Industries (MSI). The mandate of this newly formed ministry was to oversee and complete the restructuring of the UOP—which had long been plagued by inefficiency and opacity—and to address the systemic dysfunctions of the military-industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This institutional shift created a second acquisition budget dedicated to the development of advanced defense technologies and the modernization of the military-industrial base. Allocations to the MSI started in 2021 and became a mechanism through which the government aimed to invest in innovation—outside the legacy channels of the MOD and UOP that had failed to deliver results. However, despite this effort, both the MSI and the restructured Ukroboronprom—transformed into a joint-stock company in 2023, where the single shareholder is still the government, and rebranded as the Ukrainian Defense Industry (UDI)—continued to face constant leadership changes and failed to deliver new capabilities. Therefore, on the brink of the full-scale Russian invasion, Ukraine found itself incapable of developing and producing innovative weapon systems, and its defense-industrial base remained largely outdated and inefficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2022 full-scale invasion was a major pivot point. Ukraine had to change its defense acquisition strategy to integrate innovations from the commercial sector into military operations. The Ukrainian Armed Forces began rapidly adopting readily available solutions—from DJI’s Mavic drones to commercial satellite imagery provided by companies such as Maxar and Planet Labs. However, this surge in demand for innovative commercial products quickly exposed the rigidity of existing procurement system, which lacked both the speed and flexibility required in wartime conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response, the Ukrainian government introduced a parallel acquisition mechanism for unmanned capabilities. Initially focused on addressing operational constraints and acquiring off-the-shelf commercial drones, this approach soon evolved to include direct contracting with startups and commercial companies emerging within Ukraine’s defense tech ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To support this effort, a third acquisition budget was established alongside a simplified acquisition process, administered by a third agency. This budget was earmarked specifically for nontraditional capabilities—primarily unmanned systems across all domains, electronic warfare tools, and later, advanced sensors and AI-enabled technologies. To institutionalize this new pathway, the SSSCIP was granted a dedicated procurement authority, formalizing its role as a central actor in acquiring next-generation unmanned and autonomous systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spending data across the three principal defense budget programs show how priorities have changed since 2018. As illustrated in Figure 2, the MSI’s budget program first appeared in 2021, amounting to just 3 billion UAH (around 75 million USD), a negligible figure in the context of defense industrial base development. This figure shows that modernizing the legacy defense industry and acquiring new capabilities received little attention at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The landscape shifted dramatically following the full-scale invasion, as the Ukrainian government prioritized large-scale procurement of weapon systems and military equipment through the MOD. However, in 2023, another strategic pivot became evident—for the first time, 30 billion UAH was directed toward the procurement of unmanned systems from the commercial sector—signaling a commitment to leveraging and outsourcing R&amp;amp;D to nontraditional defense suppliers. For comparison, this figure is almost twice the investment into new capability acquisition from the state-owned legacy industry that year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jNtaTBC.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Three Major Budgets Within Ukrainian Defense Spending Designated for New Capabilities Acquisition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new model proved highly effective. Therefore, in 2025, the MOD announced plans to allocate 110 billion UAH—out of a its total acquisition budget of nearly 500 billion UAH—specifically for drone procurement. Although this process will be administered through the MOD’s Defense Procurement Agency, it will follow the same principles established for unmanned technology acquisition: reliance on a military-commercial technology online marketplace, authorization for direct unit-level procurement, and accelerated procurement cycles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that the MOD’s approach closely mirrors the model employed in recent years by SSSCIP for commercial drone procurement, this planned budget reallocation can be conceptually added to the 47 billion UAH previously allocated under the SSSCIP program. The two programs operate under nearly identical rules, differing primarily in the administrative body overseeing them within the defense sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the cabinet of ministers retains the authority to supplement this funding through ad hoc decisions. For example, in February 2025, it authorized an additional disbursement of 8 billion UAH to SSSCIP for the procurement of unmanned systems as an ad hoc measure. When aggregated, the total funding directed toward the acquisition of unmanned technologies from the commercial sector reaches approximately 165 billion UAH—amounting to nearly one-third of all expenditures on weapons and military equipment by the Ukrainian military. This trend reflects a fundamental reorientation of Ukraine’s defense acquisition strategy toward a more agile and innovation-driven model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In parallel with central budget reforms, Ukraine has decentralized procurement authority for capabilities acquired from commercial sector. Nearly 700 military units are now authorized to make purchases based on a commander-approved list of essential items instead of the traditional dependency on annual procurement plans and lengthy budgeting cycles. This procurement authority covers not only unmanned systems, but also electronic warfare, counter-unmanned aerial systems (C-UAS), sensors, parts, transportation, communication systems and other items beyond big expensive weapons systems and platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military units receive funding from two primary sources: (1) direct transfers from the state budget and (2) reallocated funds from local budgets. In December 2024, the Ukrainian government authorized direct budgetary transfers to military units specifically for the procurement of unmanned systems, allocating the equivalent of 27 billion UAH over an 11-month period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, local authorities were granted the flexibility to quickly redirect part of their own budgets in response to urgent needs of frontline units. This allows local authorities, especially those close to the front line, to either support the units that protect them or simply reallocate their revenues to help equip the armed forces with the latest market technology. In 2023 alone, local authorities contributed 16 billion UAH in transfers to military units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The changes in budgeting process and decentralization in procurement authority show that Ukraine has restructured its defense spending by moving away from long-term, often inefficient capability development programs with the legacy military-industrial base, instead delegating much of the early-stage R&amp;amp;D to the commercial sector. With the exception of limited grant programs—where individual awards do not exceed 8 million UAH—there are no substantial government-funded programs to support early-stage R&amp;amp;D. As a result, commercial companies carry both the financial risk and the burden of assembling specialized talent in the initial phases of development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, once a viable product is developed, the government offsets these early investments by adopting a fast-track procurement model: acquiring technologies at full market price, even when they remain under refinement or are still undergoing operational improvement. This approach allows the government to rapidly field innovative capabilities and create incentives for private sector innovation through rapid military adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recommendations for the United States&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consolidate budget line items into bigger “pots” for more flexible and rapid resource allocation to procure unmanned systems, with one pot specifically dedicated to unmanned systems.&lt;/strong&gt; The DOD’s current highly specific budget line items fragment funding and slow the department’s responsiveness to innovation. Consolidating these lines into broader mission-aligned categories would give the DOD the agility to spend resources on what is needed and already available, reducing administrative complexity and allowing program managers to adapt to changing operational and technological demands without restarting the budgeting process from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fund the full product lifecycle across appropriations.&lt;/strong&gt; Modern capability development does not have clean boundaries between (1) research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&amp;amp;E), (2) procurement, and (3) operations and maintenance phases. Military technology constantly develops and upgrades. The DOD should revise its financial management regulations to allow a single stream of funding to support the full lifecycle of a system—from prototyping and testing to deployment, troubleshooting, iteration and sustainment. This would eliminate artificial breaks in funding and reflect how technology is actually developed and improved upon today.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a dedicated unmanned systems acquisition budget.&lt;/strong&gt; Rather than funneling all innovation through rigid acquisition pathways and program-of-record channels, the DOD should carve out a standalone budget for rapid procurement of unmanned technologies at high technology readiness levels. This readily available budget must be governed by flexible rules that allow iterative deployment, unit-level purchasing, and the acquisition of products not yet formalized in military nomenclature.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish a structural distinction between acquisition pathways for conventional platforms and a commercial-first track, starting with one for unmanned systems.&lt;/strong&gt; The DOD should formally separate the acquisition of large-scale, expensive, hardware-intensive programs—mostly major defense acquisition program (MDAP) and middle tier of acquisition (MTA) portfolios—from software-centric and commercially viable technologies. This structural distinction would allow MDAPs and MTAs to continue under the traditional oversight-heavy framework while enabling a separate, more agile path for procuring capabilities such as drones, AI-powered software, and communication tools from commercial innovators.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To draw lessons from Ukraine and to apply them to the U.S. defense acquisition system, it is first necessary to delineate which categories of systems and technologies should remain within the traditional acquisition pathways and which can be transitioned to more flexible acquisition mechanisms targeted toward the commercial sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. defense industrial base is predominantly not commercial in nature. It is dominated by a small group of large prime contractors that operate almost exclusively within the defense sphere and largely bypass the commercial technology ecosystem. Today, most cutting-edge technologies—whether in software, AI, or unmanned systems—are originally developed in commercial sector, targeted at consumer or B2B markets, and shaped by open competition and rapid iteration, not by traditional defense firms. The true drivers of innovation in unmanned and software-centric technologies lie within the commercial sector, including startups and venture capital firms, which operate outside the rigid, decades-old structures of the traditional defense ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drone technology is no exception to the broader shift toward commercially driven innovation. To rapidly address the growing demand for low-cost expendable unmanned systems, the DOD should establish a dedicated budget for the acquisition of mature, high-TRL drone technologies from manufacturers capable of scaling production quickly. This budget must be flexible—unencumbered by rigid funding categories (known within the DOD as “colors of money”)—and usable across various stages of the capability lifecycle, including iterative development, testing, fielding, and sustainment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To empower experimentation and accelerate fielding, this budget should be distributed across the services and down to lower levels of command, including combatant commands, enabling operational units to procure systems they wish to test or deploy. Critically, these funds should be made readily available outside the constraints of the standard budgeting cycle, allowing units to act on emerging needs without delay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure coherence across the force and manage security concerns, the DOD should maintain a curated list of preapproved systems—something like a much bigger Blue UAS list, managed by the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU). This list would serve as a flexible, vetted catalog of options, offering military users a wide selection of drones that meet core requirements, particularly in terms of interoperability with existing networks and software systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This initiative should be viewed as a pilot project—an initial experiment in devolving procurement authority and leveraging mature commercial technologies to meet immediate operational needs. If successful, it can serve as a blueprint for a broader shift toward commercial-first acquisition across the department. By expanding this model beyond small drones, the DOD could accelerate the integration of commercially developed technologies that bring new capabilities or upgrade existing ones, ultimately making the U.S. military more agile, responsive, and technologically competitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To determine which systems should fall under the new commercial-first acquisition framework, the “watershed” should be along the distinction between conventional, hardware-intensive platforms typically developed by major defense primes and a new generation of software-centric, cost-efficient technologies often enhanced by AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the context of the U.S. defense acquisition system, the most appropriate structural distinction aligns with separation from portfolios containing MDAPs and MTAs. This delineation reflects fundamental differences in development cycles, complexity, and vendor ecosystems, and provides a logical basis for structuring relative budget allocations between traditional and commercial-first acquisition pathways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MDAPs and MTAs encompass the DOD’s most complex, capital-intensive, and strategically sensitive systems, such as fighter jets, submarines, integrated missile defense architectures, and ships. Reforming this category is a substantial effort that affects entrenched contractual obligations, multiyear budget cycles, and layers of bureaucratic oversight. Therefore, MDAPs and MTAs should continue along established acquisition pathways with prime contractors and long-term programmatic oversight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commercial-first acquisition should focus on the vast array of capabilities that fall outside the MDAP and MTA category. These are capabilities that are within the reach of the commercial sector, such as AI-enabled software, unmanned systems, satellite constellations, next-generation communications, and even early-stage hypersonics and humanoid robotics. These technologies are often best developed not through traditional defense contractors but by startups and commercial innovators already working at the technological frontier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This distinction is not merely conceptual—it has direct and significant implications for budget structuring. Defense budgets should be divided along the same lines as the acquisition pathways. Funding for MDAPs and MTAs can continue to follow the traditional, requirement-driven, multiyear budget planning process, suitable for large-scale, complex systems with long development timelines. In contrast, the budget allocated to the commercial-first market must be designed to allow immediate procurement of readily available technologies. This funding should be oriented toward solving problems and meeting the operational needs of end users. Using this budget, commanders should be able to procure novel products that do not yet exist in military nomenclature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In discussions with CSIS, U.S. commanders and warfighters emphasized this gap. Many reported facing critical operational challenges for which commercial vendors already offer viable, well-suited solutions. However, they were unable to procure these technologies because the solutions do not align with preexisting requirements—requirements that were often written more than five years ago and are tied to rigid budget allocations. This disconnect shows the need for restructuring budgeting procedures to make funds more immediately available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the pace of innovation races in modern conflict has fundamentally changed the lifecycle of military capabilities, many systems—particularly those based on software and AI—may never reach a traditional sustainment phase. Instead, they remain in a state of continuous development, undergoing frequent upgrades and iterations. In such a dynamic environment, military customers must assess not only the deployed solution but also competing alternatives from other vendors on the market each time technology is refreshed. This process reflects the competitive environment of the commercial market and creates opportunities for multiple vendors to compete for awards, rather than locking into a single supplier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This model would enable nontraditional companies to secure more contracts from various military customers, provided those customers have access to flexible, readily available funding. Military customers should be able to fully cover costs from their available funding for testing and evaluation of commercial prototypes by conducting paid pilots. This will make military customers more responsible during the selection process as they use their own funds and pay the full price for selected prototypes to reward companies for delivering products with high technological maturity. In doing so, companies are rewarded for their early-stage R&amp;amp;D investments by gaining the opportunity to sell high-maturity prototypes and codevelop them with the military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach moves the defense innovation ecosystem away from its current dependence on achieving program-of-record status as the sole pathway to profitability. Instead, it offers immediate returns to companies and their investors and lowers the barriers to entry for firms, opening this commercial-first market for competition. At the same time, said competition incentivizes continuous, operationally tailored technological progress among companies to keep winning contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commercial-first market reshapes the product development lifecycle by redistributing responsibilities and funding sources: early-stage innovation driven and funded by private capital, and public investment focused on testing, validation, and fielding. Figure 2 illustrates this realignment across capability development lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/PscFAhC.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: Redistribution of Responsibilities and Shift in Funding Sources Within Drone Budget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these reforms would build a more dynamic, responsive, and innovation-ready budgetary environment within the Department of Defense for non-MDAP acquisitions. By shifting from a static, siloed model to one that reflects the tempo and structure of modern technology development, the Pentagon can unlock access to its 200-billion-dollar market for the commercial sector and bring the most innovative capabilities to the field at the speed of relevance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;dimension-2-transformation-of-processes-across-capability-development-lifecycle&quot;&gt;Dimension 2: Transformation of Processes Across Capability Development Lifecycle&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lessons Learned from Ukraine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukraine successfully adapted its drone acquisition lifecycle by aligning it with the commercial technology development process.&lt;/strong&gt; Faced with urgent wartime demands and the failure of legacy procurement systems, Ukrainian authorities abandoned rigid, linear frameworks in favor of an agile, iterative model that mirrors how commercial products are developed—from identifying needs to prototyping, testing, and refinement. This shift enabled faster delivery of frontline-ready capabilities and fostered a closer partnership between government and the commercial sector, proving the value of applying product development principles to defense acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukraine has redefined how military requirements for drones are generated by shifting from top-down forecasting to a bottom-up, problem-driven approach rooted in battlefield realities.&lt;/strong&gt; Instead of issuing rigid technical specifications, Ukrainian military authorities now articulate their needs as operational problems communicated directly by end users—either through direct engagement with developers or formats like hackathons and government-run challenges. This method focuses on essential functions over fixed designs, accelerates responsiveness, encourages innovation from a broader pool of suppliers, and ensures that solutions remain relevant and aligned with the evolving demands of the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Ukrainian military outsources early‑stage drone R&amp;amp;D to the commercial sector and tests prototypes only at high TRL.&lt;/strong&gt; Ukraine has shifted the burden of funding and supporting early R&amp;amp;D and prototyping to private industry, encouraging companies to experiment, self‑fund, and iterate until their concepts reach TRL 7-9. Instead of selecting a single contractor and waiting for incremental progress, the military now receives prototypes that can move directly into government‑led testing, evaluation, and codification into the military arsenal. This approach concentrates public resources on final validation and leverages market capacity for earlier R&amp;amp;D.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukrainian forces procure a “good enough” product to complete a mission rather than chasing maximal technical sophistication.&lt;/strong&gt; The Ukrainian military selects unmanned systems that meet operational needs instead of buying the best system with “showcase” features whose battlefield value is unclear. This pragmatism saves scarce resources for higher‑priority technical needs, while the speed of commercial innovation lets the military pivot quickly to improved models. Often, systems stay at the prototype stage as they undergo constant, sometimes monthly, upgrades in response to enemy countermeasures.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukraine has embedded frontline warfighters into the testing and evaluation process of unmanned systems, ensuring that only combat-relevant technologies are adopted.&lt;/strong&gt; Soldiers with direct operational experience—including drone operators and users of AI-enhanced systems—participate in evaluation commissions and have a decisive voice in determining whether a system is ready for procurement. This user-centered approach is reinforced by rigorous testing under battlefield-like conditions, including exposure to real electronic warfare threats and variable terrain. Together, these practices ensure that new technologies are validated not just in theory, but through practical, end user–informed assessments that reflect the realities of modern combat.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the full-scale invasion, Ukraine, like many other militaries around the world, relied on a traditional multiyear acquisition framework with a rigid, linear sequence of stages. The process typically began with a classified requirement development phase, followed by the selection of a designated enterprise within the state-owned military-industrial base to deliver a capability. This was then followed by a lengthy and costly capability development effort, which often failed to result in actual delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numerous issues plagued this system. Projects frequently stalled due to lack of funding, the loss of engineering talent, and excessive bureaucratic oversight, such as repeated inspections by the MOD. Delivery timelines were often extended to secure continued budget allocations. In some cases, collusion between ministry officials, who initiated the capability and requested funding, and enterprise managers, who produced progress reports justifying further investment, allowed programs to drag on indefinitely. While both sides were benefiting from this arrangement, the result was a failure to deliver defense capabilities, ultimately weakening the country’s readiness to defend its sovereignty and people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the military’s decisive shift toward the commercial sector to acquire effective, frontline-ready capabilities fundamentally transformed the country’s approach to defense acquisition. The most significant change was the alignment of Ukraine’s defense acquisition framework with the commercial product development lifecycle. The pressing demand for speed, innovation, and reliability—particularly in areas such as unmanned systems, software platforms, and AI solutions—forced the removal of unnecessary stages, bureaucratic checks, and outdated procedures that had previously slowed the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new lifecycle did not emerge as an end-to-end strategy or a formalized vision of military leadership. Instead, Ukrainian authorities addressed bottlenecks and obstacles as they arose in the process of acquiring unmanned systems from the commercial sector. The approach that organically developed in Ukraine has significant value, as it represents a refined set of practices validated through real-world application under the conditions of an active war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new lifecycle, shown in Figure 3, is now much shorter and more agile, closely aligned with how commercial technologies are developed and brought to market. Any commercially developed product—whether hardware or software—typically follows the same product development cycle: (1) initial identification of a specific need or problem (not requirements), followed by (2) developing a technological solution and creating of a prototype or MVP by a commercial company, and (3) progressing through phases of testing, refinement, and eventual delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout this process, iterative development plays a central role. Every iteration enhances the product’s performance, aligns it more closely with user needs, and advances its level of technological maturity. This continuous feedback and adaptation loop is essential for development of unmanned capabilities specifically, in order to achieve the level of readiness necessary for operational deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 3: The Ukrainian Military Commercial Sector Capability Development Life Cycle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At every stage of the new lifecycle framework, the government made necessary changes in regulation and funding procedures, which brought the military approach to capability acquisition closer to practices in the commercial sector. Although the revised process may appear straightforward, it plays a vital role in aligning language, timelines, expectations, and commitments between government and industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the full-scale invasion, capability acquisition timelines in Ukraine averaged approximately 11 years, with some programs taking as long as 20 years to complete. Since then, Ukraine has managed to shorten this process to an average of 18 months—and, in the case of small expendable systems, to as little as 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recommendations for the United States&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Replace requirements with problem statements that come directly from those who will use the technology.&lt;/strong&gt; Instead of relying on rigid engineering requirements set far in advance, the U.S. military should define its needs through operational problem statements developed directly by those who will deploy the technology in the field. This approach is especially relevant for small drones and other unmanned systems, where rapid iteration and adaptability are essential. These problem statements should be communicated to the commercial ecosystem to guide innovation and encourage creative technical approaches. The only additional requirement should be that any proposed system integrates smoothly into existing and planned military networks, ensuring compatibility and interoperability from the outset.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outsource more early‑stage drone R&amp;amp;D to commercial industry and only test and evaluate prototypes that are at least TRL 6–7 (i.e., ready for testing in operational environment).&lt;/strong&gt; The DOD should rely more heavily on commercial actors to conduct early-stage R&amp;amp;D for drone technologies, reserving government involvement only for the evaluation of systems that have already reached a high level of maturity—those at or beyond TRL 6–7. In practice, this means the military would receive prototypes ready for field testing, significantly shortening development timelines. This approach allows the private sector to absorb initial development risk, promotes competition, and ensures that only technically viable and operationally relevant systems move into military testing pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Test and evaluate mature systems in operational or near-operational environments.&lt;/strong&gt; Testing and evaluation should be driven by end users—those who will actually operate the systems—in environments that replicate real battlefield conditions. For unmanned systems, this means including variables such as contested electromagnetic environments, complex terrain, and extreme weather. For AI-enabled drone software, this requires secure, closed-loop testing environments that incorporate realistic operational data and simulate actual use cases. Allowing users to assess the systems ensures technological relevance and encourages iterative refinement based on frontline feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adopt a simplified and flexible procurement procedure—“other transactions” (OTs)—as the default mechanism for procuring drones from a nontraditional vendor.&lt;/strong&gt; To enable fast, flexible acquisition of commercially developed unmanned systems, the DOD should make OT authority the standard mechanism for working with nontraditional vendors. OTs allow the military to prototype and scale production without the bureaucratic constraints of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). For this to be effective, acquisition professionals need dedicated training on OT design and implementation, so they can structure agreements that are legally sound, strategically aligned, and tailored to the pace of commercial technology development.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current acquisition process in the DOD still reflects legacy approaches to innovation development and adoption—much like the outdated system Ukraine inherited from its Soviet past. This is not a coincidence, as the U.S. acquisition system is also a product of the Cold War era, a time when technological progress moved at a much slower pace and the military was the main driver and funder of innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the most significant technological breakthroughs no longer appear in classified military labs, but rather in the offices of tech startups and large tech companies—often led by engineers in sneakers and T-shirts rather than white lab coats. While many of these breakthroughs are still indirectly supported by government funding, the gap between the commercial and military innovations in both the speed and nature of technological leaps has grown dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this reality, the military’s challenge is not to compete with the commercial sector or to try to recreate its innovative success within the military industrial base, but rather to find the most effective ways to leverage these advancements and adapt them for defense purposes. The acquisition system is that gateway through which commercial technology can enter and be integrated into the military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the DOD still relies on a complicated, multistage process created to manage the entire lifecycle of a capability—from defining requirements and developing a prototype to procuring, using, and eventually divesting it. This system is deeply embedded in institutional policies, with funding procedures, layers of bureaucracy, and decisionmaking processes all organized around a rigid, requirement-based structure. Designed for a different era, this framework now struggles to keep pace with the speed, innovation, and agility demanded by modern conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOD’s most recent effort to modernize its acquisition system is the Adaptive Acquisition Framework (AAF), launched in 2020. The core idea behind the AAF is to give program managers more flexibility by offering six different acquisition pathways. Each pathway is designed to match the specific needs of a given capability, allowing faster and more efficient development. The goal is to move away from outdated, one-size-fits-all processes and reduce unnecessary bureaucracy, making it easier to deliver new technologies to the military more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in reality, the AAF pathways largely remain a refined version of the old system, rather than a true departure from it. Despite its intended flexibility, it continues to operate within the same institutional constraints and bureaucratic structures it was designed to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The programs continue to experience significant delays, lack of readily available resources for procurement of available solutions, and slow technology transitions. The MTA pathway, intended to accelerate delivery of systems smaller than MDAPs, shows considerable inefficiencies. The DOD plans to invest 44.5 billion USD across 20 of its most expensive MTA programs, yet many face development timelines that stretch well beyond their original targets. Several programs now anticipate delivering initial capabilities years after their MTA phases end. Moreover, programs entering the MTA pathway with immature technologies often face protracted development cycles rather than rapid fielding. The Government Accountability Office found that none of the seven reviewed MTA programs with low technology maturity were ready for production or fielding by the end of their efforts. These delays reveal a persistent structural inability to deliver timely innovation, even under acquisition models designed for speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To meet today’s challenges, the U.S. government should go beyond the AAF for unmanned systems acquisition and align this capability development process more closely with commercial product development practices. This means not just simplifying the capability lifecycle, but also rethinking how each stage should support faster adoption, continuous updates, and better alignment with the pace and methods of commercial innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, any military capability starts with a formal process of writing detailed requirements. Within the current U.S. defense acquisition system, developing formal requirements is a complicated process which often takes years. As U.S. military personnel shared with CSIS, this process typically produces lengthy, highly technical documents, sometimes hundreds of pages long, that narrow the pool of potential vendors, often favoring a small group of large defense primes willing and able to meet the extensive list of specifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better engage the commercial sector, requirements for commercial technology solutions should be short—preferably no more than three pages—focused on the operational problem, and flexible enough to allow a range of innovative approaches. Unlike traditional government-led R&amp;amp;D programs, the commercial sector can offer diverse, nonstandard solutions that compete on performance and cost efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way military needs are shared with industry should also be updated. A single easy-to-use digital platform should be developed to let companies quickly see what the military needs, determine how urgent each problem is, and connect directly with end users through events, webinars, or other interactive tools. This direct communication would help companies better understand the problems and tailor their solutions more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, capability requirements should originate closer to the real operational environment. Ukraine’s experience has shown that operational needs can vary significantly across different parts of the frontline and domains, showing the importance of context-specific solutions. For the United States, this means that, ideally, combatant commands would engage more frequently and directly with industry to inform and refine operational needs development alongside formal acquisition processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two examples within the DOD illustrate how requirements generation and communication can be modernized to better align with contemporary innovation practices. First, The Navy’s PEO for Digital and Enterprise Services, or PEO Digital, shared with CSIS that the office has developed the Electronic Requirements Governance Board (eRGB), a digital, Jira-style ticketing system that allows end users to submit capability needs and enables PEO Digital to further track, refine, remove duplications, and assign resources. Each request is reviewed within a unified platform that integrates feasibility assessments, dependency analyses, and real-time dashboards. This system reduces the average requirements cycle from three years to just three months, enabling faster translation of operational needs into actionable acquisition initiatives, while improving transparency and minimizing duplication across the Navy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the DIU has redefined how capability needs are communicated to industry through its use of Commercial Solutions Openings (CSOs). These brief solicitations describe operational problems without prescribing technical solutions, leaving room for commercial creativity and rapid response. By often requiring those proposed solutions to be only interoperable and integrable with existing systems, DIU ensures technical compatibility without stifling innovation. This concise format also functions as a technology scouting tool, allowing the DIU to quickly map emerging technologies and engage with a broad spectrum of commercial actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next stage of the product development lifecycle is the most time-consuming and resource-intensive: research, development, and prototyping. Commercial companies and startups outpace government and big primes because competitive market pressure and commitments to investors drive fast, continuous iteration for a working prototype or MVP. In the commercial technology world, software updates roll out far faster than any formal requirements or budgeting cycle can track, and success is measured by delivered products rather than achievement of process milestones. Therefore, outsourcing early R&amp;amp;D lets the military tap this momentum and receive mature, high‑TRL prototypes without bearing the cost of prolonged R&amp;amp;D in usual acquisition process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOD must establish continuous technology scouting to maintain real-time awareness of the commercial innovation landscape. This requires consolidating all incoming responses from existing channels—such as CSOs, Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) submissions, and service-level innovation hubs—into a unified, searchable database. Each entry should be evaluated against the TRL scale and made accessible across program offices to avoid duplication and improve coordination. An additional mechanism should be created to receive and assess unsolicited commercial proposals, tracking their readiness and any prior DOD engagement. Together, these efforts would provide acquisition professionals with a real-time map of available commercial capabilities, ensuring that promising and existing solutions are evaluated and not lost in bureaucratic silos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure that these unmanned systems prototypes align with actual operational needs, testing and evaluation must be conducted by the same end users who originally identified the capability gaps. A concern raised numerous times by combatant commands in discussions with CSIS is that too often the systems delivered to them are based on assumptions generated at the service level, resulting in misaligned or underperforming capabilities. Embedding end users directly into the testing process, ideally within the intended deployment environment and alongside manufacturers’ engineering teams, enables real-time feedback and rapid iteration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is particularly crucial for AI-powered software for unmanned systems, which should be evaluated in controlled, secure environments that replicate operational conditions, using declassified data where feasible to for realistic assessment. The U.S. military can implement this approach by decentralizing testing and evaluation and embedding it closer to the operational edge. This can be achieved through the establishment of dedicated units—small-scale equivalents of the DIU—within each service or even at lower levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more effective model for testing and evaluation may involve empowering existing acquisition entities—such as PEOs—to conduct experimentation in close cooperation with the end users, as demonstrated by the success of Navy’s PEO Digital in piloting commercial solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the heart of PEO Digital’s Innovation Adoption Kit is its four-stage “investment horizons” model, which structures the journey of technology from early exploration to operational deployment. Horizon 3 serves as the entry point for commercially developed innovations, acting as a technology backlog filled with solutions that have emerged independently of Navy funding. This allows the Navy to monitor a broad range of emerging capabilities without immediate investment, institutionalizing early-stage scouting and creating a pipeline for future testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a Horizon 3 technology shows promise, it moves into Horizon 2, where the Navy funds pilot programs to evaluate performance in mission-relevant environments. These pilots prioritize outcome-based testing over full compliance with military standards, removing a major barrier for commercial entrants. Flexible contracting tools—such as OTs—enable rapid iteration, with some Navy program offices running up to 20 pilots a year compared to the traditional pace of just 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a pilot proves effective, Horizon 1 facilitates the transition to scaled deployment by streamlining budgeting, governance, and compliance steps. Instead of requiring all regulatory hurdles be cleared up front, this phase front-loads only what is necessary, accelerating adoption while managing risk. One 2022 Innovation Adoption Kit open call drew over 100 commercial applicants, and within seven months, an AI analytics firm had gone from proposal to fielded contract. This approach offers vendors a transparent and accelerated path from prototype to production while ensuring that government investment is tied to demonstrated results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, organizations like the Rapid Capabilities Offices and U.S. Special Operations Command have developed agile frameworks that prioritize operational relevance and iterative feedback. The Rapid Capabilities Offices, for example, uses a model that directly involves warfighters in identifying urgent capability gaps, rapidly sourcing prototypes, and testing them under real operational conditions. Special Operations Command’s SOFWERX is an example of how collaborative ecosystems—with open access to small businesses, academia, and labs—can drive innovation at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, despite these advances, many of these efforts still lack well-defined pathways for transitioning validated solutions into larger acquisition programs, limiting their broader impact. To solve this problem, services and end users should have readily available budgets, as discussed in previous chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, an important aspect of innovation adoption is contracting. It should not be treated as a special form of art requiring a vast, siloed workforce. Instead, it should be boiled down to a technical service—focused on executing agreements—within a broader product development ecosystem. This approach would allow acquisition professionals to focus on one core function: structuring fair, efficient contracts that support the iterative development, maintenance, and scaling of systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adopting a single default contracting mechanism across the product lifecycle would simplify this process significantly. OTs—nontraditional contractual instruments employed by the DOD to support research, development, and prototyping activities outside the FAR—already offer this kind of flexibility. Specifically designed to engage nontraditional defense contractors and accelerate the adoption of innovative technologies, OTs offer a highly flexible mechanism for structuring agreements that align with commercial business practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By exempting some key regulatory requirements, such as cost accounting system compliance and conventional intellectual property provisions, OTs reduce barriers to entry and facilitate broader participation from private sector innovators. Unlike standard procurement contracts, OTs are not subject to many of the statutory constraints typically governing federal acquisitions, including the Competition in Contracting Act. This legal flexibility enables the tailoring of agreements to the specific needs of emerging technologies and diverse development models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While OTs frequently rely on RDT&amp;amp;E funding, their use is not limited to this appropriation category. Agreements may be structured as fixed-price, expenditure-based, or hybrid models, depending on the nature of the project and its anticipated outcomes. This adaptability makes OTs particularly well suited for advancing defense innovation through rapid, mission-driven procurement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later stages of the capability lifecycle are beyond the focus of this analysis. In the Ukrainian context, many systems are deployed directly to the front line after testing and procurement, often used in combat before reaching any formal sustainment phase. In the U.S. context, technologies that advance beyond prototyping can enter further iteration cycles where every new procurement will be conducted as a market transaction or transition into traditional sustainment processes. Both stages are characterized more by incremental adjustments and bureaucratic management than by rapid innovation. As such, these phases offer little insight into the dynamics of commercial integration or agile acquisition, which are the central focus of this report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;dimension-3-digital-communication-channels&quot;&gt;Dimension 3: Digital Communication Channels&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lessons Learned from Ukraine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digital platforms enable real-time collaboration between military users and commercial innovators.&lt;/strong&gt; Real-time communication between military end users and commercial innovators is essential for developing effective unmanned systems. Ukraine has demonstrated the importance of building dedicated digital platforms that enable frontline soldiers to interact directly with civilian engineers throughout the entire capability development lifecycle. These platforms—such as Brave1 and DOT-Chain—facilitate early-stage problem identification, feedback exchange during prototyping, and post-deployment assessments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digitalization streamlines testing, procurement, and feedback cycles.&lt;/strong&gt; By digitizing traditionally paper-based processes, Ukraine has streamlined the cycle of testing, procuring, and refining commercial technologies, particularly in the drone sector. Online procurement marketplaces allow unit commanders to directly select and acquire unmanned systems based on immediate needs. At the same time, digital feedback and reporting mechanisms ensure that warfighters can quickly report performance issues, request improvements, and influence future procurement decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The communication between commercial and defense worlds should go digital. It cannot be buried in paperwork or stalled by outdated rules. Soldiers on the front lines and engineers in hoodies need to be in real-time communication, solving urgent problems together. The future of defense depends on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine, having already made significant success in digital governance, has begun extending this approach to its military. While it has not yet established a unified system of a capability delivery, it has launched initiatives to address immediate communication needs through digital tools. If these initiatives are eventually integrated into a coherent digital infrastructure, Ukraine could get a sophisticated, agile capability development system grounded in direct communication between its armed forces and its industrial base. The following section explores some of these emerging initiatives in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Brave1 platform, launched soon after the full-scale invasion, was initially designed to foster collaboration between defense sector institutions and the private technology industry. One of its most distinctive features is its use of open calls, challenges, and hackathons to collect solutions from innovators in response to urgent battlefield needs. In close coordination with the MOD and other agencies, Brave1 aggregates frontline requirements and communicates them to industry as requests for prototype submissions. Whether through formal challenges or open solicitations, the platform serves as a centralized channel through which multiple startups and early-stage companies can submit technologies for evaluation and potential testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond its role in requirements communication, Brave1 also functions as a national-level technology scouting tool. According to representatives interviewed by CSIS, the platform is aware of approximately 85 percent of all defense technology products currently developed in Ukraine. As such, Brave1 effectively bridges the gap between military demand and industrial supply by facilitating early engagement of emerging defense companies and maintaining real-time visibility into the innovation landscape. It embodies the principles discussed earlier in this report: digitalizing requirements formulation, accelerating prototyping, and enabling a continuous, structured dialogue between the military and the commercial ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For testing and evaluation purposes, Ukraine has developed institutional mechanisms to support rapid, end user–driven testing of defense technologies, with a strong emphasis on digitalization and operational relevance. One key initiative is the Iron Range system, which combines a newly established government-owned testing range with a fully digital application and evaluation process. The system replaces paper-based procedures and allows manufacturers to quickly and regularly access state testing infrastructure and technical expertise. This enables commercial companies to test their technologies, refine them, and get approved for limited operational use within weeks rather than years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MOD is also launching the DOT-Chain Defense weapons marketplace operated by the Defense Procurement Agency. The marketplace represents a groundbreaking shift in Ukraine’s defense acquisition strategy, introducing a digital, decentralized system that empowers frontline units to select and procure the capabilities they need directly from domestic manufacturers. Launched with a pilot allocation of 1 billion UAH for 10 brigades of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the system enables military units to independently order drones within their assigned budgets using a transparent digital platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Units can browse available systems, place real-time and preproduction orders, leave reviews, and submit maintenance requests—bringing consumer-style flexibility and feedback mechanisms into defense procurement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the supplier side, drone manufacturers upload product listings, update availability and production timelines, and deliver directly to the military, bypassing traditional intermediaries. The Defense Procurement Agency serves as the coordinating body, managing payments, monitoring deliveries, and analyzing user feedback to refine procurement and ensure accountability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With over 80 domestic drone producers already applying and more than 400 UAV models proposed, DOT-Chain is quickly becoming a central node in Ukraine’s wartime tech ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future plans include scaling the marketplace beyond drones to other weapon categories and integrating it with Army+, an app for digital services and reporting in the armed forces, to streamline logistics, maintenance, and frontline requests—further reinforcing Ukraine’s agile, demand-driven model of defense innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the marketplace, the ministry is developing a feature within Army+ to enable feedback collection on unmanned systems performance, the results from which will be shared with the manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has taken important steps toward building a digital ecosystem to support the integration of commercial technologies into its military arsenal. However, this progress has not emerged from a unified, top-down strategy, rather, it has resulted from a series of ad hoc initiatives aimed at closing communication gaps and resolving specific bottlenecks as they arose. Therefore, these efforts are fragmented, developed and managed by different government stakeholders, making coordination and integration into a single platform challenging. This fragmentation reflects the broader realities of wartime innovation: the urgency of conflict has acted both as a catalyst for rapid action and a constraint on long-term planning and institutional coherence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recommendations for the United States&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish a unified digital platform for defense innovation that spans the full capability lifecycle.&lt;/strong&gt; The DOD should develop or adapt a single user-friendly platform that enables real-time communication, submission of proposals, testing coordination, and progress tracking across all branches and agencies. This system should communicate problem-based requests for technical solutions, allow both solicited and unsolicited submissions, store testing and performance data in a centralized, searchable repository, and connect military needs with existing commercial solutions using AI-enabled tools. It should also serve as a hub for industry engagement events and integrate current tools like Digital OnRamp, Tradewinds, and Vulcan into a coherent, streamlined interface.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mandate the use of this platform through formal policy and institutional incentives.&lt;/strong&gt; To ensure adoption, the DOD must implement a policy shift that requires the use of the unified digital platform for all commercial technology–related acquisition and communication. Without mandatory usage or alignment with success metrics, such tools risk becoming underutilized. Clear directives and institutional buy-in will be essential for building a genuinely connected innovation ecosystem across the military and the commercial sector. Incentives to motivate acquisition professionals and military personnel to use the platform could include integrating platform engagement into performance reviews, promotion criteria, and award recognitions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike Ukraine, which was forced to build digital solutions under the pressures of wartime urgency, the United States has the advantage of peacetime stability, and with it, the time and resources to design a unified digital system for collaboration with the commercial sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure effective communication across the product development lifecycle and between the military and industry, the DOD should establish a single, modern digital platform with integrated communication channels, enabling real-time collaboration, information exchange between the industry and the military, as well as progress tracking. This platform, which could be newly developed or built upon existing systems, must serve the entire DOD and all services to prevent duplication of efforts and facilitate shared awareness of operational needs and available commercial solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The platform should support the full capability development cycle for commercial technology and include several key functions. The basic workflow should function as shown in Figure 4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/G3s4i9V.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 4: Workflow Within a Single Digital Platform&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, after military end-user needs are collected and articulated as problem statements—with only minimal technical requirements such as interoperability standards—these solicitations (e.g., CSOs) should be published in a dedicated section of the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, commercial companies should be required to register and maintain individual secure profiles through which they can submit proposals, track their progress, and maintain confidential communication with acquisition officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, all submitted solutions should be stored in a centralized database, updated in real time with each proposal’s status and testing outcomes. This database must be accessible across the DOD, allowing acquisition professionals and end users to search existing submissions, evaluate prior testing results, and identify solutions that could satisfy new requirements without duplicating development efforts. Military users should be able to view solution specifications, integration histories, and feedback from other units to inform purchasing decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies should likewise have visibility into their performance records with DOD customers, enabling them to build business pipelines based on demonstrated capability delivery. The platform should incorporate intelligent search functions, including AI-enabled matching tools, to connect military needs with existing solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, companies should be able to independently register and present unsolicited solutions, broadening the pool of available technologies. These entries would be marked as “not yet tested” but would allow the DOD to quickly identify promising innovations for future pilot programs or evaluations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifth, the platform should also centralize information about industry engagement events—such as industry days, hackathons, and technology challenges—facilitating broader participation from military units facing similar operational challenges and encouraging collective problem-solving efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this platform would serve as a digital backbone for continuous communication between the military and the commercial sector across the entire product development lifecycle. It would reduce duplication, consolidate efforts and resources, and enhance coordination in areas such as training, logistics, and capability deployment, thus supporting broader doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel, and facilities—or DOTMLPF—integration and modernization efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are few initiatives in the DOD that partially align with the vision described above. These digital platforms are an effort to make it easier and faster for military organizations to connect with commercial technology providers. These tools help match military needs with innovative solutions from the private sector, streamlining the way new capabilities are discovered, tested, and acquired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital OnRamp, built by the DIU, uses AI to match plain-language descriptions of defense needs with relevant commercial technologies. Tradewinds Solutions Marketplace, managed by the Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office, offers a searchable library of vetted, ready-to-contract solution videos from industry and academia. Vulcan, sponsored by U.S. Special Operations Command, acts as a national security-focused scouting platform that helps identify and evaluate promising technologies. Together, these and other platforms represent a growing effort to modernize defense acquisition by opening the door to faster, more direct engagement with commercial innovators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, each of these platforms is seeing a limited use and has not yet become the go-to place where the military and industry communicate and work together. To change that, there needs to be a policy shift that requires communication and business processes to go through a single platform. People are rarely willing to change how they work unless it is either required or clearly tied to their success—so making the use of such a platform mandatory is key to building a truly connected and effective system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;next-steps-for-the-department-of-defense&quot;&gt;Next Steps for the Department of Defense&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adopt a commercial-first approach for acquiring unmanned systems—using these rapidly evolving technologies as a proving ground for broader acquisition reform.&lt;/strong&gt; These technologies are advancing fastest in the commercial sector, where innovation cycles are shorter and new capabilities emerge continuously. Given the strategic importance of AI and autonomy to future warfare, and the pace at which these technologies are being developed outside traditional defense channels, it is critical for the DOD to prioritize their acquisition directly from commercial providers. This will allow the military to test new acquisition models that can later be scaled across other capability areas.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish a dedicated, flexible budget for unmanned systems that spans the full capability lifecycle without separation into colors of money and is not constrained by traditional appropriations.&lt;/strong&gt; To accelerate the acquisition and fielding of unmanned systems, the DOD should create a separate budget line that can be used across research, development, procurement, and sustainment phases. This funding pool should be decoupled from rigid, predefined requirements and made readily available for acquiring mature, commercially developed technologies. By consolidating narrow budget categories into a larger mission-aligned fund, the DOD would gain the flexibility to quickly procure and iterate on unmanned systems based on evolving operational needs. This approach would reduce administrative delays, enable continuous upgrades, and reflect the real-world pace of technology development and battlefield demands.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organize funding for unmanned systems around broad mission areas, not narrow, preset requirements, to enable faster problem-solving and support commercial innovation.&lt;/strong&gt; This shift would allow military units to address real-time operational challenges by purchasing available commercial technologies rather than waiting for lengthy procurement cycles tied to outdated or overly specific requirements. By focusing on mission outcomes rather than predefined technical specifications, the DOD can more easily integrate nontraditional vendors, accelerate adoption of emerging capabilities like drones and AI systems, and create incentives for private sector R&amp;amp;D investment. This more flexible approach also ensures that acquisition aligns with the dynamic nature of modern conflict, where needs evolve rapidly and speed of adaptation can determine battlefield advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a separate acquisition track for unmanned systems that prioritizes off-the-shelf procurement at high maturity levels, distinct from conventional platforms multiyear acquisition.&lt;/strong&gt; Unlike conventional acquisition programs—which fund technology maturation and follow lengthy development and oversight processes—this commercial-first pathway would focus on procuring off-the-shelf or near-ready unmanned systems using a dedicated budget with readily available funds. This approach would enable rapid fielding of capabilities without waiting for traditional program timelines and allow the military to buy what it needs now, rather than investing years and resources into maturing technologies that already exist on the commercial market.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lower entry barriers for nontraditional vendors by removing noncritical security requirements in early testing and fielding of unmanned systems.&lt;/strong&gt; Excessive clearance and facility security demands—such as requiring personnel and production sites to meet strict security standards, cybersecurity checks, and components’ origin control—pose a major obstacle for small startups, which often lack the resources to navigate this complex process. For companies with often fewer than ten employees, meeting these requirements can delay or block access to pilot opportunities altogether. Easing these constraints is a critical first step, such as piloting and testing, toward opening the defense market to commercial-first solutions and enabling faster testing and adoption of innovative technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ensure rapid access to testing infrastructure and enable trials in conditions that closely replicate real operational environments.&lt;/strong&gt; Current processes in the United States often require six months to a year—or more—for companies to gain access to military testing ranges. This delay risks making technologies obsolete before they are even evaluated, especially in fast-moving fields like AI, autonomy, and electronic warfare. Moreover, existing U.S. testing environments are heavily constrained by domestic regulations, limiting the realism of trials. For example, restrictions on frequency use and jamming often prevent the simulation of real-world threats, such as those involving non-GPS satellite systems like GLONASS. To address this, the DOD should either reform outdated regulatory barriers to enable more realistic domestic testing or consider outsourcing evaluation to allied nations like Ukraine, where battlefield-like conditions and relevant threats can be more accurately simulated.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shift cost evaluation approach from unit price to mission-based value, aligning more closely with the price-per-mission model used by Ukraine.&lt;/strong&gt; Rather than focusing solely on the upfront cost of individual platforms or systems, the DOD should assess the overall effectiveness and cost-efficiency of a technology in the context of its operational impact. Ukraine’s experience demonstrates that low-cost, commercially available systems—such as FPV drones or AI-enabled platforms—can deliver disproportionate battlefield value when judged by their ability to complete specific missions rather than their unit cost. This shift in perspective encourages the adoption of agile, scalable, and often lower-cost solutions that may not meet traditional procurement benchmarks but offer significant advantages in real-world operations. By focusing on price per mission, the DOD can make smarter investments, reward functional performance, and accelerate the integration of commercially developed capabilities that deliver tangible impact on the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create dedicated units within each service to help testing and evaluation of new technologies in real operational settings and by end users.&lt;/strong&gt; To make testing more effective and relevant, these activities should be done by the actual end users within the services. Organizations such as DIU are still seen as outsiders and do not control service-level budgets. Instead, the services themselves should set up permanent innovation units with access to flexible funding for commercial-first capabilities, allowing them to test commercial technologies, evaluate performance in real-world conditions, and buy what works directly and quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Train and test AI-enabled autonomy software for unmanned systems in operationally relevant environments to perform effectively.&lt;/strong&gt; For any AI system to work properly, it must be built on data that reflects the realities of its intended use. Autonomous unmanned systems need exposure to the actual terrain, enemy equipment, and countermeasures to navigate accurately and detect threats. Similarly, AI platforms designed for analyzing open-source intelligence must be able to recognize patterns, narratives, and behaviors specific to a country’s language, media environment, and population. Without this contextual training, AI systems risk underperforming or producing misleading results in real-world operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build a unified digital platform to manage end-to-end collaboration with the commercial sector.&lt;/strong&gt; This platform should consolidate functions currently spread across multiple tools and enable military users to communicate their needs as operational problems to the industry and allow commercial companies to submit, track, and update their proposals through secure profiles. A shared, searchable database would ensure visibility into submitted solutions, testing outcomes, and prior integration results—helping avoid duplication and speeding up adoption. The platform should incorporate AI-enabled search to match military needs with relevant technologies. By establishing this digital backbone and making its use mandatory in acquisition from the commercial sector, the DOD can enhance coordination, improve acquisition efficiency, and support long-term modernization across the force.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. military is failing to leverage the full potential of the U.S. commercial sector—particularly in unmanned systems and AI-enabled software, where the U.S. technology companies are global leaders. As warfare becomes increasingly software-driven, AI will be central to enabling next-generation capabilities such as autonomous systems and unmanned platforms. These technologies are advancing rapidly in the commercial domain and must be integrated into defense acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fully harness this potential, the DOD must make three critical changes: (1) create a separate budget which is not be tied to rigid requirements and line items for procuring, testing, fielding, and iterating commercial technologies at speed, (2) remove outdated and excessive security and classification barriers that currently exclude nontraditional vendors and favor only large defense contractors, and (3) build modern, digital communication channels that allow real-time collaboration between commercial innovators and military end users. Together, these steps would lay the foundation for a true commercial-first acquisition model capable of keeping the U.S. military on the leading edge of technological innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a shift will take time, but there is precedent—the evolution of the U.S. space sector. For decades, NASA led a government-only model of space exploration and providing services for national security agencies. But over time, commercial companies like SpaceX, Maxar, and Planet Labs emerged and were given the opportunity—and funding—to demonstrate their value. Today, two parallel systems coexist, with the commercial sector proving to be not only cost-effective but often more agile and operationally capable. The DOD can take a similar path with unmanned systems, gradually integrating a commercial-first model alongside traditional acquisition and allowing results to speak for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The success of this approach in Ukraine lies in the dual-track systems that coexist alongside and complement one another. By embracing this shift, the department can not only unlock the full potential of U.S. innovation but also build a defense ecosystem that is better prepared for the demands of modern warfare. The time to act is now—while the United States still has the advantage of peace, unmatched technological leadership, and the resources to lead this transformation on its own terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;黃子悅鄒家成質疑顛覆與暴動罪分期執行-總刑期具壓毀性&quot;&gt;黃子悅鄒家成質疑顛覆與暴動罪分期執行 總刑期具壓毀性&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/QkhafwN.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2020年初選47人涉嫌串謀顛覆國家政權，其中31名被告認罪，不認罪16人當中有14人經審訊後被裁定罪成，李予信及劉偉聰2人罪脫。11人不服定罪及刑期上訴，認罪的黃子悅提刑期上訴。案件今（17日）在西九龍法院（暫代高院上訴庭）繼續上訴聆訊。上訴方就刑罰上訴方面陳詞，梁國雄、林卓廷和黃碧雲均投訴原審法官錯誤地歸類他們為「積極參與者」，導致量刑起點過重；另外，梁國雄和林卓廷稱過去長期服務社會，卻未能獲得扣減；何啟明和陳志全更力陳他們服務社會的時間較長，理應比其他服務時間較短的被告獲得更多扣減。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃子悅和鄒家成均另涉暴動案而判監，二人均投訴兩案刑罰完全分期執行，導致總刑期具壓毀性（crushing）。其中鄒家成指，原審法官下令本案刑期與7.1立法會暴動案的5年1個月15天完全分期執行，以致兩案的總刑期達到12年10個月15天，接近13年，這樣的刑罰對於剛從大學畢業、未有任何社會經驗的鄒而言，是具有壓毀性（crushing）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件由高院首席法官潘兆初、上訴庭法官彭偉昌及彭寶琴審理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;經審訊後被裁定罪成並提出上訴的11名被告包括：鄒家成（判囚7年9個月）、吳政亨（判囚7年3個月）、何桂藍（判囚7年）、林卓廷（判囚6年9個月）、余慧明（判囚6年9個月）、梁國雄（判囚6年9個月）、何啟明（判囚6年7個月）、黃碧雲（判囚6年半）、楊雪盈（判囚6年半）、鄭達鴻（判囚6年半）及陳志全（判囚6年半）。認罪囚4年5個月的黃子悅，則提出刑期上訴。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;律政司代表包括：副刑事檢控專員周天行、高級助理刑事檢控專員劉德偉、助理刑事檢控專員羅天瑋、高級檢控官吳加悅、徐倩姿和莊文欣等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄭達鴻黨友譚文豪路線更激進-惟原審法官一律以7年作量刑起點&quot;&gt;鄭達鴻：黨友譚文豪路線更激進 惟原審法官一律以7年作量刑起點&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;資深大律師潘熙代表鄭達鴻指，原審法官未有恰當地區分各名被告的罪責、案中角色和參與程度，相比起鄭達鴻，同屬公民黨的譚文豪在黨內的角色較重要，為時任立法會議員，甚至採取更加激進的路線，可是原審法官卻一律採用7年作為量刑起點。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 鄭達鴻（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘又指，原審法官接納鄭達鴻犯案是因為被人誤導，予以扣減3個月，但強調這是一個有力的減刑因素，理應獲得較低的量刑起點，或者更多扣減。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘又指，鄭不是純粹對法律無知，以致錯誤地相信涉案謀劃是合法，他甚至研究過《基本法》，但是仍然被誤導，法庭在這項因素上應該扣減多於3個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;梁國雄錯誤地被歸類為積極參與者長期服務社會應獲扣減&quot;&gt;梁國雄：錯誤地被歸類為「積極參與者」、長期服務社會應獲扣減&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙接著代表梁國雄陳詞，同樣指原審以監禁7年作量刑起點是明顯過重及原則上犯錯。潘指，原審法官錯誤地將梁歸類為「積極參與者」；又指法庭已裁定社民連於2020年6月才開始轉變立場，若果法庭恰當地評估梁的參與程度、案中角色和罪責，相比起其他一開始便立場堅定的同案被告，梁國雄的罪責較輕微和低。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘又指，原審法官聲稱梁在過往的案件中曾因為長期服務社會而獲得減刑，因此拒絕在本案因為相同理由而減刑，潘認為是原則上犯錯。潘強調，梁過往長期服務社會，構成其個人背景和特質，理應在每一宗案件獲得這方面的扣減。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊雪盈不會否決財案-相反熱衷爭取政府撥款&quot;&gt;楊雪盈：不會否決財案 相反熱衷爭取政府撥款&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表楊雪盈的大律師張耀良指，本案的謀劃性質是非暴力，並且嘗試就未來發生的事情達成協議，例如若果能夠達到「35+」的話，他們便會同意在議會裡做一些事情，這與其他類型的謀劃有所不同。張續指，初選的參與者橫跨不同政治光譜，各人有不同的想法、從政經驗、願景和期望；而且計劃受著事件發展的影響，例如在過程中香港社會變遷、選民的最終決定等等，因此他們不會知道接著會發生什麼事。由此可見，涉案謀劃從誕生直至最終結果，有一定程度的距離。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/3AAXSmQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
▲ 楊雪盈&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張籲法庭考慮案件的嚴重程度，對國家安全和整體社會帶來的危害到底有多少迫切性，加上被告們在陽光之下行事、公開透明，有別於在「黑箱」裡作案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張指，楊雪盈從沒有將否決財案與「五大訴求」捆綁在一起，也沒有任何證據顯示她在口頭上或書面上表明會否決財案，可見她在整個計劃中扮演著邊緣的角色。張又指，趙家賢曾引述楊稱：「戴耀廷又有啲佢嘅諗法又帶出嚟㗎啦，咪由佢講吓先囉，但即係選到入立法會裡面嘅時候，係每個議員自主行使個權力㗎嘛！」，可見楊是涉案謀劃的局外人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張又指，趙家賢曾供稱楊在區議會生涯中，熱衷於爭取政府撥款，並推動將政府撥款用於她倡議的文化及改善民生政策，所以她不會否決財政預算案，相反只會要求政府增加撥款。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳志全及何啟明長期服務社會-理應獲得更多扣減&quot;&gt;陳志全及何啟明：長期服務社會 理應獲得更多扣減&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表何啟明和陳志全的大律師馬維騉指，原審法官一律對「積極參與者」的被告採用7年為量刑起點，但他認為「積極參與者」之中較低參與程度的被告，其量刑起點應該進一步下調。原審法官理應區分不同被告的參與程度。馬維騉進一步指，對於較低參與程度的被告，量刑起點應該定於5至6年。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬又指，原審法官判刑時理應考慮《基本法》第50至53條的合憲性，從而考慮被告真誠、但錯誤地相信涉案謀劃是合法的，強調這因素能夠減低被告的道德罪責。馬又指，法官應該根據案中事實而決定對「錯誤信念」給予多少減刑比重。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬另指，何啟明擔任區議員約6年，獲給予2個月扣減，可是有的被告在2020年才開始擔任區議員，直至案發時任期只過了6個月，卻同樣獲得2個月扣減。馬認為何啟明不只服務時間較長，更致力服務基層和有需要的市民，理應獲得更多扣減。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/BaIp4hv.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
▲ 何啟明（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於陳志全，馬指原審法官只給予3個月扣減，未能對陳長期服務的質量給予恰當比重。陳被視為最勤力的立法會議員，甚至獲立法會主席梁君彥讚賞，指陳的言之有物及準備充足，亦有政府官員為陳撰寫求情信。馬強調，陳過往與政府和建制派攜手合作，勤力地履行議員職責，有良好往績，並服務了8年，理應值得比3個月更多的扣減。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黃碧雲不應被歸類為積極參與者-理應被判處3年或以下&quot;&gt;黃碧雲：不應被歸類為「積極參與者」 理應被判處3年或以下&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表黃碧雲和林卓廷的大律師沈士文指，原審法官對案中「積極參與者」採用3至10年為起點，因此大部份被告均採用7年為起點，惟法庭量刑時應該考慮各人的犯案角色，以及涉案計劃所預期的後果。當中尤以犯案角色為較重要因素，因預期後果是非常遙遠。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈指，「35+」在某些初選參與者眼中只是一句口號、一個亮眼的願景，但是現實上要達至「35+」，除了要在地方選區取得大多數議席之外，還需要在功能組別的35席之中取得13席，然而在初選計劃中，功能組別中除了衛生服務界和「超區」有初選之外，便沒有任何其他界別有舉辦初選，正如第一控方證人區諾軒所稱，「35+」是不可能達成。因此，達成「35+」然後否決財案、癱瘓政府運作，是幾近不可能，惟原審法官未有予以充份考慮。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈指，林卓廷和黃碧雲均來自民主黨、是傳統泛民，其中黃更擔任立法議員達8年，可是二人被指與民主黨立場捆綁，因而被定罪。沈強調，二人從沒做任何事去鼓吹否決財案，反指二人的角色被動，沒有出席過初選協調會議，對涉案謀劃不感興趣，幾乎是沉默的一員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈指，林和黃不應被歸類為「積極參與者」，理應被判處3年或以下，可是原審法官卻採用7年為量刑起點，與其他激進的參與者相同，是原則上犯錯。沈並補充，若然上訴庭不同意判處二人3年或以下，判處約4年也是公道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/u8j1Aiv.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;林卓廷服務社會至少8年-理應獲扣減&quot;&gt;林卓廷：服務社會至少8年 理應獲扣減&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於林卓廷，沈指判刑的時候，林只有一項刑事定罪紀錄，惟原審法官的量刑是基於林有4項定罪紀錄，是犯了錯誤。若果原審法官接受林只有一項定罪紀錄，便會進一步扣減刑期，因定罪紀錄關乎個人特質。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈續指，林卓廷服務社會至少8年，有良好的往績和聲譽，可是原審法官卻未有就此給予3個月扣減，沈指林理應獲得這3個月扣減。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒家成原審判兩案分期執行-致總刑期接近13年-具壓毀性&quot;&gt;鄒家成：原審判兩案分期執行 致總刑期接近13年 具壓毀性&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表鄒家成的大律師關文渭指，本案判刑的時候，鄒有兩項刑事定罪紀錄，其中一項為「將未經授權的物品攜離監獄」罪，是相對輕微的控罪，原審被判囚3天，其後經上訴獲撤銷監禁刑罰，改判罰款。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關又指，原審法官基於鄒是「墨落無悔」聯署聲明的發起人之一，而判處較重刑期，是忘記了「墨落無悔」是在《國安法》實施之前發生，亦非控罪時段範圍之內。《國安法》生效之後，有關行為才變為有罪，然而原審法官未有重視《國安法》第五條的規定：「法律沒有規定為犯罪行為的，不得定罪處刑」，以致判處了一個有追溯力的刑罰。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關又指，原審法官將鄒歸類為「積極參與者」，以7年為量刑起點，其後再考慮鄒是「墨落無悔」發起人之一，將量刑起點上調至8年，構成「雙重計算（double counting）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於刑罰整體性，關指原審法官下令本案刑期與7.1立法會暴動案的5年1個月15天完全分期執行，以致鄒兩案的總刑期達到12年10個月15天，接近13年，這樣的刑罰對於剛從大學畢業、未有任何社會經驗的鄒而言，是具有壓毀性（crushing），然而原審法官卻未有充份考慮。關指，兩案部份刑期同期執行，已足夠反映鄒在兩案之中的罪責。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余慧明參與初選非為個人利益&quot;&gt;余慧明：參與初選非為個人利益&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;資深大律師彭耀鴻代表余慧明指，余的判刑明顯地過重，原審法官將余與其他「積極參與者」均無差別地採用7年為量刑起點，而未有區別各位「積極參與者」的角色、參與程度和罪責的分別。彭強調，余未曾出席初選協議會議，亦從沒擔任更積極的角色。彭又引述案例指出，若然法庭未有裁定串謀計劃實際上成功執行，量刑應該大幅降低。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/uxeOPwr.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
▲ 余慧明&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭並指，余參與初選並非為了個人利益，然而這一點未有反映在原審的判刑中。彭解釋，涉案謀劃並非為了推翻當時的特區政府，而是跟據《基本法》下的制度行事，余參與初選只是想為特區政府帶來改變，因她真誠地相信當時的特區政府對民意充耳不聞。再者，若果主流民意抱持相同想法，又若果政府依然我行我素、拒絕回應民意，余才會繼續參與涉案謀劃。彭強調，余並非為了個人利益，而是為了香港人的福祉；她的信念是對還是錯，或者是否實際上假扮爭取市民福祉，並不是法庭需要研究的範疇。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黃子悅原審法官未下令本案與暴動案刑期同期執行-未能恰當地評估刑罰整體性&quot;&gt;黃子悅：原審法官未下令本案與暴動案刑期同期執行 未能恰當地評估刑罰整體性&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;認罪的黃子悅只提出刑罰上訴，代表她的大律師郭子丰指，原審法官未能恰當地考慮刑罰整體性。在本案判刑之前，黃因為理大暴動案而被判監禁37個月，其時正在服刑，她其後因為本案被判監禁4年5個月（53個月），惟原審法官未有下令兩案刑期任何部份同期執行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭指，黃是一名積極的年輕女性，她積極地參與義工活動，深度地參與有關社會公義的工作，縱使在獄中仍然從不間斷地學習。若果原審法官恰當地評估刑罰整體性的話，便會知道兩案分期執行的話總刑期會是7年6個月，這等同於採用11年作量刑起點，是過份地壓毀性（unduly crushing）。郭冀上訴庭考慮暴動案和本案並非兩個完全獨立的事件，黃在兩案中的罪責有所重疊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;律政司被告涉違背公職及公眾信任-長期服務社會的減刑因素應佔最小比重&quot;&gt;律政司：被告涉違背公職及公眾信任 長期服務社會的減刑因素應佔最小比重&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;助理刑事檢控專員羅天瑋回應指，本案牽涉的是一個前所未見的串謀計劃，有機會對香港造成毀滅性的危機，原審法官完全有正當理由採用較高的量刑，又指原審法官之所以對吳政亨和鄒家成採用8年為量刑起點，是因為二人在案中角色較重要。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對於林卓廷一方投訴未能獲得長期服務社會的扣減，羅天瑋則反駁指，原審法官量刑時已考慮了被告長期服務社會，又指被告的行為牽涉違背公職以及公眾的信任，即使法庭將長期服務社會這因素納入考慮，也只能佔最小的比重。羅重申原審法庭的判刑理由完全正確。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表林卓廷的大律師沈士文最後回應，指他談及長期服務社會的減刑因素時，重點不在於法庭應給予多少比重，而是原審法官對不同被告有差別對待，黃碧雲與林卓廷均長期擔任立法會議員，黃獲得扣減3個月，但林卻未能同樣獲得同樣待遇。&lt;/p&gt;

To prevail in the era of agentic warfare, the U.S. requires smarter, faster command structures including Networked, Relational, and Adaptive models to outpace China and seize the advantage at machine speed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States’ 200-year-old “Napoleonic” staff system is no longer fast enough for an era in which artificial intelligence (AI) agents can sense, decide, and act in milliseconds. This report, produced by the CSIS Futures Lab, explores how the Department of Defense (DOD) can replace today’s industrial-age military staff organizations with smaller, nimbler, AI-enabled command elements able to out-cycle peer adversaries such as China. The United States cannot out-innovate authoritarian rivals with nineteenth-century staff designs. Fielding adaptive, AI-enabled staffs—backed by robust networks, skilled people, and relentless experimentation—will let U.S. forces think and act faster than any adversary, preserving decision superiority in twenty-first-century conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;why-it-matters&quot;&gt;Why It Matters&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agentic warfare is here.&lt;/strong&gt; While AI agents have been a reality for decades, they are now able to automate intelligence fusion, refine threat models, and recommend courses of action, compressing decision timelines from days to minutes. Without new staff designs, U.S. commanders will lose the race for decision superiority.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China is optimizing its forces to attack U.S. critical vulnerabilities.&lt;/strong&gt; People’s Liberation Army (PLA) doctrine aims to disrupt U.S. decision networks by winning the information high ground and paralyzing the United States through a mix of cyber, electronic, and long-range strikes; staffs that are not distributed and capable of dynamic reconstitution will be ineffective in combat, if not destroyed outright in the opening salvo.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analytical baseline:&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers reviewed divergent concepts of how people interact with machines and form knowledge networks to provide options for rethinking the staff outside of the traditional military literature.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mixed human-machine method:&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers combined retrieval-augmented large-language models (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini) with three workshops of experienced officers to generate and stress-test alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real PLA scenarios:&lt;/strong&gt; Each staff concept was run against three demanding missions drawn from Chinese doctrine—a joint blockade, a joint firepower strike, and a joint landing campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ixdO7fZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: Three Agentic Staff Options Examined&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-findings&quot;&gt;Key Findings&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adaptive wins.&lt;/strong&gt; Across all models and scenarios, the Adaptive Staff scored highest and showed the greatest resilience to PLA system disruption tactics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People still matter.&lt;/strong&gt; Success hinges on a new cadre of officers fluent in AI orchestration, able to audit algorithmic recommendations, and ready to assume control when networks degrade.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tempo beats mass.&lt;/strong&gt; Smaller, feedback-driven staffs consistently generated more viable options faster than larger legacy organizations, turning speed into a surrogate for force size.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strategic-challenges&quot;&gt;Strategic Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Computational Infrastructure:&lt;/strong&gt; There is no future for AI agents and new staff organizations unless the U.S. military invests in more computational infrastructure to power command decisionmaking.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coordination at Machine Speed:&lt;/strong&gt; Decentralized agents can fragment efforts if a common command logic is absent, creating a need for deeper human expertise on smaller agentic staffs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyber-Resilient Networks:&lt;/strong&gt; AI dependence widens the PLA’s attack surface unless zero-trust, deception-resistant architectures are baked in from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human Capital:&lt;/strong&gt; Officers must learn AI literacy, data visualization, and enough basic statistics and computer science to understand machine-generated insights, not just traditional staff processes rooted in historical cases and strategic studies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;priority-recommendations-for-congress-the-dod-and-the-services&quot;&gt;Priority Recommendations for Congress, the DOD, and the Services&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Launch a multiyear experimentation campaign.&lt;/strong&gt; Direct the Chief Digital and AI Office (CDAO) to run iterative wargames, building on the Global Information Dominance Experiment (GIDE), that pit competing staff designs against common threat scenarios, with mandated annual reports to Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Close the compute gap.&lt;/strong&gt; Fund a classified, distributed high-performance cloud and edge architecture able to host AI agents during contested operations; commission an independent study to size the requirement and options to meet it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accelerate AI-ready professional military education.&lt;/strong&gt; Embed explainable AI, agent orchestration, and prompt engineering modules across professional military education and create fast-track “AI facilitator” qualifications for mid-grade officers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harden decision networks.&lt;/strong&gt; Resource redundant communications, adversarial learning defenses, and audit trails that trace how agents reach recommendations, enabling commanders to trust—but verify—machine advice.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Institutionalize rapid lessons learned.&lt;/strong&gt; Pair every major exercise with data pipelines that retrain agents and update tactics in weeks, not years; require synthetic data from AI-driven simulations to feed this loop continuously.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;long-term-outlook&quot;&gt;Long-Term Outlook&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operational art would combine human creativity and judgment with AI agents fusing data and making predictions.&lt;/strong&gt; Smaller staffs have the potential to out-cycle legacy military organizations, generating tempo and giving commanders more time to think beyond the forward line of troops.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continuous agentic wargames and simulations would make war plans more adaptive and relevant.&lt;/strong&gt; Smaller staffs could run iterated simulations using AI agents that refine the DOD’s ability to deter a global collection of authoritarian regimes and fight dispersed networks of combined joint task forces across multiple scenarios. These continuous games, guided by AI agents, would drive human and machine learning while identifying new deterrence options and operational concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New curriculum would revolutionize professional military education.&lt;/strong&gt; Officers should study historical campaigns alongside seminars on data science, modern weapon systems, and AI fundamentals to understand how to fight alongside AI agents fusing information. Schools could then capture data and support fine-tuning these agents through techniques like reinforcement learning with human feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all intents and purposes, the staff organizations of militaries around the world today would be recognizable to French military legend Napoleon Bonaparte. While there are enduring aspects of warfare, it is hard to imagine that eighteenth-century staff structures are optimal for twenty-first-century warfare. The question is: What are the alternatives?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report explores how advances in AI are changing strategy and statecraft. This study combines leading network relational theories with the emerging agentic artificial intelligence capabilities for three possible agentic military staff structures. It outlines the results of several wargames that applied these three structures to possible crisis and conflict scenarios to determine the strengths and weaknesses of the staff options. This report complements ongoing research programs in the CSIS Futures Lab and a broader intellectual community that sees bundles of algorithms and distributed mosaic networks as the defining trend changing warfare. As new applications diffuse across the national security enterprise, the question is no longer if AI will change war, but how, and which state using it will emerge as the leading military power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That race will be decided by a mix of infrastructure investments, espionage and counterespionage, and a willingness to experiment with how military organizations conduct planning and operations. While analysis abounds on the race between China and United States to build the computational infrastructure required to support further advances in AI and the game in the shadows to steal and protect intellectual property, less attention has been paid to how to structure a military staff for a new era of warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Napoleonic staff model has served for over 200 years, its end is near, owing to the rise of agentic warfare, a new paradigm in military competition where AI agents operate alongside human commanders to accelerate decisionmaking and outpace adversaries. As the speed and complexity of modern conflict surpasses human cognitive limits, traditional industrial-age staff structures struggle to keep pace. Agentic warfare distributes autonomous AI agents across land, sea, air, space, and cyber domains and joint functions, enabling them to continuously collect intelligence, anticipate adversary intent, and recommend adaptive courses of action in real time. These AI agents are meant not to replace human judgment but to enhance it, compressing decision timelines from days to minutes and allowing commanders to act faster and with greater precision. By integrating AI at the tactical and operational levels, agentic warfare reshapes the character of operational art, ensuring U.S. forces maintain decision superiority in twenty-first-century battlespaces. However, realizing this vision requires a fundamental shift from hierarchical staff structures to networked, AI-enabled command architectures designed for speed, adaptability, and real-time operational synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rethinking this legacy staff structure in view of leading network relational theorists results in three distinct options for an AI-enabled agentic staff of the future:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;a &lt;strong&gt;Networked Staff&lt;/strong&gt; that retains the functional focus of the current staff structure but applies AI agents to those functional areas for better and faster output;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;a &lt;strong&gt;Relational Staff&lt;/strong&gt; that aligns functionally trained AI agents into teams (termed “netdoms”) that are tasked and managed by cross-functionally–focused humans (termed “switchers”); and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;an &lt;strong&gt;Adaptive Staff&lt;/strong&gt; that aligns on the iterative decisionmaking process of a staff and organizes humans to shepherd agents through that process.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;option-1-the-networked-staff&quot;&gt;Option 1: The Networked Staff&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing on the tenets of actor-network theory, this decentralized staff architecture fuses human and nonhuman actors (e.g., AI agents, sensors, and data-driven tools) into an integrated web of capabilities that shapes, refines, and executes decisions in real time. This network is functional, with smaller staff elements working through functional agents to fuse data. In effect, each staff section has its own AI agent leading to independent intelligence, movement and maneuver, fires, command and control, force protection, logistics, and information nodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/oBq1FJZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: The Networked Staff&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In the Networked Staff model, based on Bruno Latour’s concept of actants, smaller staff elements work through functional agents ingesting data including live updates, doctrine, history, and military theory. These functional agents also adjudicate inputs from other functional agents. For example, a small G2 team interacts with its functional agent to develop possible enemy courses of action. This data is fed directly to the fires agent, which assesses possible target areas of interest based on named areas of interest, to start developing a concept of fires and cross-checking it against inventories of munitions to create notional essential fire support tasks and even attack guidance matrices. The logic is functional, preserving elements of the legacy staff system, but potentially brittle if the links between functional agents are broken. Humans serve as expert reviewers of agentic inferences offered to commanders. This provides a human-in-the-loop check, but could slow data flows.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reorient legacy staffs to a networked structure, DOD leaders should consider the following recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Invest in computational infrastructure.&lt;/strong&gt; Build a robust backbone of high-performance computing, data storage, and networking on classified networks to seamlessly integrate AI agents into each node for real-time analysis and planning.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Train and integrate AI agents.&lt;/strong&gt; Develop, refine, and deploy machine learning models that empower distributed decisionmaking, ensuring AI-driven insights are woven throughout the staff network.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build human capital.&lt;/strong&gt; Equip the radically reduced number of people in the network (“super-empowered personnel”) with the higher-order synthesis skills to operate in a decentralized, AI-driven environment—encompassing data analysis, AI systems operation, and collaborative decisionmaking.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish new procedures.&lt;/strong&gt; Develop clear protocols for data sharing, communication, and decentralized planning that harness AI-driven inputs and maintain coherent, agile operations in a setting likely to see fewer staff layers between the battlefield and the commander.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;option-2-the-relational-staff&quot;&gt;Option 2: The Relational Staff&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing on relational sociology, this staff design treats the military organization as a dynamic web of relationships shaping planning and operations. These webs are effectively clusters of existing staff functions that interact independent of humans. The resulting netdom—inspired by Harrison White’s sociological theory of networks—becomes its own staff, where AI agents tailor recommendations and plans based on discrete datasets. Multiple netdoms support the commander and command element, or human switchers, allowing them to see competing perspectives in near real time. The switchers bridge these netdoms, forging critical links and fostering negotiation among alternatives. This model has fewer people than the Networked Staff model and has a different AI agent configuration as well as a different role for humans in decisionmaking. In a Relational Staff, human commanders adjudicate among competing netdoms, whereas in the networked model above, functional staff play a larger role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/L97kbo3.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: The Relational Staff&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In the Relational Staff model, based on Harrison White’s concept of actants, a human switcher—likely the commander—evaluates different options generated by competing clusters of functional agents aligned with traditional staff sections. Each of these netdoms runs entire planning cycles within seconds and can be tuned (i.e., temperature) to adjust variance. The netdoms could even be aligned, based on the commander with his/her personal Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), a set of references ranging from historical cases to a treatise on how they envision fighting their unit, using methods like RAG. As a result, the commander/command element has competing agentic planning teams (i.e., netdoms) allowing them to always explore alternative options and even red team AI agentic clusters using other netdoms. Return to the intelligence fires example: The commander has one netdom develop a course of action based on its best judgment and his desire to conduct an area defense in which the netdom will explore how to combine canalizing terrain with indirect fires to prioritize engagement area development and attrition as the enemy moves through the battlespace. He tasks the other AI agent to focus on a preemptive fires-based spoiling attack. The different course of action (COA) concepts, each developed by the command element, allow the commander to more rapidly reach a decision and issue warning orders to subordinate formations. The logic is command-centric and turns legacy staff sections into AI agents. It is brittle at the point of the commander. If the leader does not have the necessary depth of military experience, education, and judgement, they will struggle to ask the netdoms the right questions.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to investments in computational infrastructure, the DOD should implement the following recommendations to reorient legacy staffs to a relational structure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Map the organizational web.&lt;/strong&gt; Conduct a thorough network analysis to uncover existing relationships, clusters, and information flows, laying the groundwork for distinct netdoms aligned with functional communities of practice (e.g., command and control, information, fire, maneuver, intelligence, protection, and sustainment).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stand up functional netdoms.&lt;/strong&gt; Create specialized nodes (e.g., operations, intelligence, and logistics) where AI agents recursively iterate among themselves to provide tailored insights, ensuring each community generates unique perspectives while remaining interconnected.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Train human switchers.&lt;/strong&gt; Develop leaders adept at bridging netdoms, facilitating negotiations, and fostering collaborative problem-solving across diverse communities and AI-driven analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embed AI agents in each community.&lt;/strong&gt; Integrate machine learning tools at the netdom level to process relational data, refine strategies, and deliver real-time recommendations that spark cross-domain synergy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;option-3-the-adaptive-staff&quot;&gt;Option 3: The Adaptive Staff&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by Andrew Abbott’s approach to adaptive planning, this staff model is built around a series of interconnected processes (e.g., planning, execution, and assessment) that continuously adjust to shifting operational realities but are rooted in a deeper context connected to military history and theory. AI agents embedded within each process furnish real-time data and insights, while human facilitators ensure alignment with higher-level objectives. This fusion of machine-driven analysis and human oversight enables a fluid, iterative decision cycle that rapidly evolves with changing circumstances. The defining feature that differentiates the model from the network and relational models is the reliance on feedback loops that help human staff and commanders adapt their plans to changing circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/mHSYchR.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 3: The Adaptive Staff&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Adaptive Staff model is based on Andrew Abbott’s insights about non-linear dynamics governing how people create knowledge. In this perspective, the entire planning and operations process is seen as an agent-informed evolutionary system. There is still a small staff element, albeit smaller than the Networked Staff model. This staff interacts with a planning agent, which integrates data on doctrine, lessons learned, history, and military theory. These planning agents, based on staff prompting, inform operations agents. Like in the netdom concept, the operations agents work at a pure agentic level across functional agents, providing feedback that adjusts the planning agents’ output to provide more refined, up-to-date options for the commander. This allows the commander to steer the staff, creating in effect two key feedback loops: (1) human-agent and (2) agentic. The result is an accelerated decisionmaking process that makes planning and operations more tightly coupled. Decisions still reside in human judgment but adjust to rapid changes in the environment mediated by agentic insights. Back to the example, the commander tasks the staff to develop a defensive plan along a ridgeline and river (i.e., tie into terrain). The staff works through the planning agent, adding insights from historical cases and defensive tactics, to update possible courses of action, which the operations agent adjusts based on readiness, logistics, and estimates of enemy avenues of approach. The feedback loops are the defining feature, balancing human-agent interaction and supporting more rapid adjustments to changing context. This aligns the approach most with perspectives that see war on a complex, nonlinear system.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to investments in computational infrastructure, to adopt an adaptive structure, the DOD should consider the following recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operationalize interconnected processes.&lt;/strong&gt; Structure planning, execution, and assessment as continuous loops that feed into each other, ensuring real-time synchronization among all phases of an operation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embed AI-driven analytics.&lt;/strong&gt; Integrate AI agents into each process to provide near-instant insights, detect emerging patterns, and support iterative decisionmaking under fluid conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Empower human facilitators.&lt;/strong&gt; Train staff to guide, validate, and interpret AI recommendations across processes, keeping the overall mission in focus while harnessing data-driven inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrate continuous feedback loops.&lt;/strong&gt; Implement real-time tracking and assessment tools that automatically inform subsequent planning cycles, allowing for seamless course corrections.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultivate an iterative mindset.&lt;/strong&gt; Foster a culture of adaptive thinking and rapid learning, encouraging experimentation and flexible responses to evolving operational realities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the three options offers a viable path into the future and a guide for how to rethink everything from the structure of current military staffs to how to educate future leaders. While the purpose of this report is to define pathways toward agentic warfare, the Adaptive Staff emerged as the preferred option according to model-based evaluation. When three foundational models—ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude—were tasked with evaluating each of the three options against a mix of PLA campaigns, the consensus choice was the Adaptive Staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this consensus across foundational models, each model offers a unique approach for experimentation. More than anything else, the DOD needs to start an aggressive campaign of experimentation that cuts across legacy service interests and equities to imagine the future of agentic warfare. This effort is less about getting the tech right than understanding human-machine interactions at scale and how to build agentic staff organizations. This will require an iterated approach that uses a common set of threat scenarios used to evaluate how best to restructure staffs—similar to the proof of concept explored below using PLA campaigns. This campaign of learning will also likely require external evaluation beyond the services and the DOD to ensure objectivity and accountability, to possibly include required congressional reporting. Regardless of its final form, which can be mapped by organizations like the CDAO, among others, the experiments must intentionally explore alternatives to legacy staff structures that have changed little in hundreds of years and are poorly aligned to take advantage of advances in AI and machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report proceeds by establishing the historical foundation of the modern staff. From this vantage point, it adapts prominent ideas from political science and sociology to propose alternatives to the legacy Napoleonic staff for waging agentic warfare. Given these alternatives, the report shifts to stress-testing them, using common threat scenarios adapted from PLA doctrine to support algorithmic analysis, with three foundational models (ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude) used to analyze how an agentic staff would perform. The report concludes with an inventory of recommendations that include launching a campaign of experimentation and building the infrastructure and human capital required to wage agentic warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-evolution-of-military-staff-organizations&quot;&gt;The Evolution of Military Staff Organizations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The modern military staff is a central component of operational and strategic decisionmaking in armed forces worldwide. They essentially manage complexity by automation, using a division of labor to coordinate and synchronize key inputs to commanders. This process is essential to modern command and the estimative processes that support it (i.e., military planning). Put simply, without a staff organization and coordinating process, military operations become kids’ soccer: There is no game plan and everyone rushes to the ball, compounding chaos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their current configuration, these organizations typically operate under a common framework that divides responsibilities into specialized functions. For example, in NATO and U.S. doctrine, the typical staff structure is divided as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;J1/G1–Personnel (Manpower and Human Resources):&lt;/strong&gt; Manages personnel policies, manpower allocation, and morale.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;J2/G2–Intelligence:&lt;/strong&gt; Collects, analyzes, and disseminates intelligence to inform decisionmaking.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;J3/G3–Operations:&lt;/strong&gt; Plans and directs current operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;J4/G4–Logistics:&lt;/strong&gt; Ensures sustainment and support, including supply chains and mobility.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;J9/G9–Civil-Military Affairs:&lt;/strong&gt; Engages with civilian agencies and multinational partners.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These staff sections largely align with military functions. In U.S. military doctrine, warfighting functions are how commanders group core capabilities to integrate, synchronize, and direct operations. In U.S. military doctrine, these functions vary by service but largely include command and control, information, intelligence, fires, movement and maneuver, protection, sustainment, and information. The core concept is that combat power emerges from integrating these functions. Wars are won not just by shooting bullets or firing missiles, but by combining fire, maneuver, force protection, and intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of a military staff has evolved from its early iterations in ancient and medieval warfare to the highly bureaucratized organizations seen in modern armed forces. While there are historical antecedents, the modern staff confirmation is largely a function of the eighteenth and nineteenth century. During the French Revolution, the ideas of Paul Thiébault informed a series of reforms that led to the état-major général (general staff ) and staff organization employed by Napoleon. This staff system allowed for greater operational flexibility, rapid planning, and the synchronization of large-scale maneuver warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prussians further refined this model in the nineteenth century, institutionalizing the general staff system, which became a hallmark of modern military planning. Over time, the system evolved to address increased scale and complexity, including large continuous fronts and mass mobilization in World War I and deeper joint and coalition integration in World War II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple authors have concluded that the Napoleonic staff system holds foundational characteristics of the industrial age that thwart flexibility and adaptability in both planning and execution. Staffs are often seen as too large, too resistant toward adaptation, and too top-heavy, resulting in what will likely be decision disadvantage in future conflict. Traditional approaches treat the commander in an overly individualistic manner that tends to result in centralized decisionmaking at the expense of dynamically responding to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, it is not clear that an eighteenth-century military process is ideal for twenty-first-century warfare. Despite their evolution, modern military staff organizations struggle to manage mass volumes of data, synchronize multi-domain effects, and integrate coalition and interagency partners. By continuing to break down complex tasks into subordinate processes, the legacy staff has grown over the years, leading to larger, often cumbersome, bureaucratic organizations. In place of mission command—centralized planning and decentralized execution—large military staffs attempt to serve both functions in a futile effort to manage complexity. This tendency toward inflexibility leads forward-deployed units to continue to experiment with augmenting the staff process to gain efficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As units integrate multi-domain effects, “the increased speed in the division’s main command post (the central orders and targeting hub) can often outpace support from sustainment and protection warfighting functions concentrated in satellite command nodes.” The DOD needs a more rapid planning cycle that allows staffs to both integrate these effects and work across larger distributed geographic areas. These military organizations can further accelerate tempo by becoming flatter and managed more by algorithm than by hierarchical chains of command devoid of context at the edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decision support is enhanced when functional expertise from across the staff and from external mission partners is brought together in direct support of the commander’s decision requirements. This idea was central to the notion of the “strategic corporal” and experiments with integrating long-range fires with distributed maneuver units as part of the Sea Dragon experiments in the 1990s. It also was a central feature of the concept of Force XXI in the U.S. Army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;from-the-iron-cage-to-networks&quot;&gt;From the Iron Cage to Networks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The military staff system reflects a larger nineteenth-century push toward rational legal authority and modern bureaucracy. The objective is control, rather than creativity, creating an “iron cage.” This concept dominates military innovation literature, where the goal is to define when, how, and why any novel idea escapes from its cage to change warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern sociology and political science no longer focus just on large institutions, bureaucratic mazes, and their role in shaping policy. Increasingly, studies focus on networks and how people—as agents—connect with each other and their environment to exchange information and catalyze change. This process has utility for visualizing and describing options for adapting legacy military staff organizations to wars that will be increasingly waged through algorithms. In other words, calls for data-centric warfare will stall if they do not simultaneously seek to reimagine what a military staff is and how it operates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three authors provide maps for escaping the iron cage of the Napoleonic staff and waging agentic warfare: Bruno Latour (1947–2022), Andrew Abbott (1948–present), and Harrison White (1930–2024).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A French academic, Bruno Latour explored how knowledge is produced. The central idea is seeing scientists not as individuals but as actors in a larger network that connects people and things (termed “actants”) to form networks, a concept known as actor-network theory. Latour’s work lends a perspective that characterizes the military planning process and larger legacy staff organization as a series of “translations,” where each actor tries to enroll others into their own vision of the operation. This process is central to knowledge production and, by extension, decisionmaking, as actants negotiate and compromise, often leading to novel outcomes. More importantly, the process leads to what Latour called inscriptions: ideas and strategies that are translated into maps, documents, simulations, and orders, which then shape how, for example, military plans and orders are understood. These inscriptions are not neutral; they carry their own biases and limitations, implying that a military staff casts a long shadow across its orders even when the officers are not present. Flows of information and influence are capable of bending rigid hierarchies. AI agents allowed to exchange information could create network effects that undermine traditional staff structures. However, as these plans and orders take shape, they often fall victim to “black-boxing”: when the logic is opaque and complexity is hidden behind simplified representations. The price of control is plans lost in translation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latour’s critiques of modern science can help shape the design parameters for adapting the Napoleonic staff for agentic warfare. First, seeing data flows as a translation process and understanding inscription help architects design more efficient and explainable systems. Agentic staffs—likely smaller than current military staffs—will need to be calibrated to the types of inscriptions that fuse tactical data with a knowledge ontology linked to military history and operational art, but at the functional level. This simple idea is where multiple automation schemes tend to fall down. They view military planning from the perspective of an engineer and optimize tagging data to support faster and more efficient workflows as opposed to treating military history, doctrine, and even structured lessons learned as forms of tacit knowledge that should inform how any AI model analyzes, routes, and synthesizes large data flows. Actor-network theory also brings to light a possible unintended consequence of the application of AI agents to the military staff: The same model training, fine-tuning, and resulting weights will produce an agentic form of Latour’s inscription. Staff officers should be aware that the training method for a frontier AI model could influence staff decisions as much as a well-crafted Concept of Operations briefing slide can shape the direction of a military plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Methods for better integrating humans in an agentic military decisionmaking network will require deeper AI literacy and deliberate design choices. Super-empowered staff officers—fewer in number but interacting with more information—will need to move beyond basic concepts like AI prompt engineering to more complex tasks, such as how to scaffold multiple AI agents together to complete a planning workflow. They will require higher-order skills, including sensing Latour’s inscription process in their staff and mapping it to the AI agents in a way that will maximize the AI’s effectiveness in the organization. This task requires users to have the ability to not only surface relevant staff data for an AI context but also recognize how the information they provide to the model will shape its output. Similarly, these staff officers should be aware of more complex AI interaction concepts such as graph theory, in which the structure of language itself is used to extract key ideas and better optimize how models search large volumes of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harrison White was an American sociologist central to the rise of network sociology. In his major work, Identity and Control, White sees relational networks as the defining feature of human social systems in which individuals and groups assume roles (i.e., identities) and seek to influence connections (i.e., control). This process creates distinct sites of social action where specific roles prevail as a form of emergent (i.e., nonlinear) behavior, or what White calls “netdoms.” Actors switch among netdoms to shape how other actors across the network perceive the world around them and thus their interests and choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applied to imagining alternatives to the Napoleonic staff for agentic warfare, White’s relation networks suggest that designers will need to enable—and understand—the switching process. The concept of switching likely implies that human agents will need to switch between peer work and working with multiple functional agent clusters, with each generating alternative military options. Furthermore, it implies a need to resurrect explainable AI efforts and find novel methods for allowing human actors in an agentic network to express causal logic and understand how algorithms generate answers (i.e., explainable AI, also known as XAI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third model emerges from the work of Andrew Abbott, an American sociologist famous for his work studying professions and the sociology of knowledge production. A central feature in Abbott’s work is how interactions among actors forge processes that unfold over time rather than static structures, creating in effect a nonlinear depiction of how social organizations—such as professions—evolve. Social phenomena tend to be shaped more by contingency (e.g., unexpected events) and unique context (e.g., emergent behavior), which makes traditional approaches to science ill-suited to explain the course of human history. The world cannot be reduced to simple cause-and-effect modeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This perspective is particularly relevant to the almost certain blurring of lines between traditional military staff roles and AI agents on the horizon, and the challenges with modeling complex systems such as war. Furthermore, it is not enough for AI agents to process large amounts of information and complete a doctrinal planning checklist. They need to be balanced against deeper knowledge ontologies that help interpret context (known as contextual embedding) and integrate human feedback (known as reinforcement learning with human feedback, or RLHF) as a way of capturing contingent events and their interpretation. These measures will help overcome modeling predictions based on standard transformer processes that have emerged over the last 10 years and defined the latest AI breakthroughs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;outlines-of-an-agentic-future&quot;&gt;Outlines of an Agentic Future&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These three models serve as a guide for thinking about applying AI agents to military staff processes and planning. An AI agent is an autonomous system capable of perceiving its environment, reasoning about it, and taking actions to achieve specific goals. At its core, an agent is defined by the agent function—a mapping from data inputs to goal-driven actions—that operates based on internal models, learning mechanisms, and contextual information. While the foundational concept of AI agents dates back to the 1970s and 1980s, the modern understanding emerged based on research in the early 1990s that defined agents as “anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through actuators . . . [establishing] a fundamental perception-action loop that characterizes agent systems.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The architecture of AI agents often reflects a balance between reactive and deliberative components. Early models, like the subsumption architecture proposed by Rodney Brooks, emphasized reactive behaviors layered hierarchically to produce intelligent action without centralized planning. In contrast, classical planning approaches rooted in classical symbolic AI—which handles representation and manipulation of explicit knowledge using symbols and rules—rely on a detailed internal model and forward simulation to generate plans that achieve specified objectives. Hybrid models, such as those proposed by Michael Georgeff and Amy Lansky, blend these approaches—allowing agents to react in real time while also engaging in strategic planning when time permits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The modern usage of the term “AI agent” implies a range of attributes that describe an ability to operate intelligently and autonomously in a defined environment. “Intelligent” does not mean general human intelligence but an understanding of particular rules, goals, and inferences that enable AI agents to make decisions based on awareness of the environment. Furthermore, agents should be able, with the right architecture, to interact with other agents and humans to create more complex workflows. This means AI agents should be able to draw logical inferences that support planning and adapting to changes based on processing new data. As data changes, the agent should learn and adjust how it executes core tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have expanded the concept of agency to include language-based agents that combine reasoning, memory, and tool use. Approaches like ReAct integrate explicit reasoning traces with application programming interface calls, allowing agents to interweave thoughts and actions in complex tasks. Agents can be embedded in simulations that allow for agentic observation, planning, and reflection to better simulate human behavior and synthesize stored data (i.e., memory). These developments mark a shift from static models to agents capable of open-ended learning and complex interaction, skills required for dealing with the fog and friction that define military planning and operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet this agentic future is not without costs and concerns. If the adage is true that military plans are worthless but planning is priceless, agents put at risk the value gained through the painful planning process. Also, the reasoning of a model (assuming there is something beyond deep pattern recognition), if abstracted or blocked from human oversight, could induce reasonable concerns of AI hallucination or fabrication of information even when results are reliable. As models become more performant, alignment of the model to human intent (whether perceived or actual) will be an increasing concern, and in the process, will renew calls for mission command. These issues offer even more reasons to increase experimentation and learning to ensure the United States fields the most performant and trustworthy AI agents supporting the national security enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To imagine possible staff organizations for agentic warfare, the CSIS Futures Lab used a mix of data-driven AI methods and qualitative judgment from workshops with military professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/VmdX65X.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 4: Research Design&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As seen in Figure 4, first, the team structured datasets on each theorist, the history of military staff organizations, modern U.S. joint doctrine, and texts of Chinese military doctrine. The research team then used Scale AI’s Donovan platform to create a combined corpus of over 200 texts as a basis for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). RAG is a method for grounding LLM-generated results based on key external sources of knowledge that provide context to the model’s representation of information. By integrating external references into the generation process, RAG not only enhances factual correctness but also provides interpretable, context-aware insights, aiding more rigorous and transparent analysis. Chinese military doctrine in the dataset emphasized joint campaigns and systems confrontation and destruction. The method ensured the team used a consistent structure of questions against a common set of structured data (i.e., knowledge ontology).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research team developed a prompting strategy based on chain of thought: a method that breaks down complex tasks into intermediate reasoning steps in order to refine the results from LLMs. These intermediate reasoning steps verify the model’s decisionmaking process, enabling more transparent analysis. Applied to the curated dataset referenced above, the major steps consisted of the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Verifying that the LLM understood each theorist (i.e., Latour, White, Abbott).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using this understanding of the theorist to imagine how to adapt legacy staff organizations for a new era of agentic warfare using the definition offered in the introduction.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having the LLM catalog possible strengths and weaknesses of the new staff structure (networked, relational, and adaptive).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assessing how well each new staff structure optimized for agentic warfare would perform against major PLA scenarios, including the following:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;a. &lt;strong&gt;Joint Blockade:&lt;/strong&gt; The coordinated use of all branches of the military to isolate a target, typically Taiwan, by severing its maritime and aerial connections through a combination of naval, air, missile, space, and information effects ranging from electronic warfare and cyber operations to propaganda and subversion.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;b. &lt;strong&gt;Joint Firepower Strike:&lt;/strong&gt; Systematically degrading an adversary’s operational capabilities by delivering precise, overwhelming strikes against high-value targets across multiple domains.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;c. &lt;strong&gt;Joint Landing Campaign:&lt;/strong&gt; The integrated use of amphibious, airborne, and special operations forces—to include unconventional and subversive elements—to seize key terrain and establish a lodgment for follow-on major combat operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conducting a workshop analysis comparing the different approaches to counter the PLA.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team used the same prompts with three different foundation models—ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude. This approach ensured a larger set of observations, but the results are still only illustrative and designed to explore different options for changing legacy staff structures. The findings below reflect the research team’s comparative analysis of the cross-model outputs based on workshop discussions with military professionals. Three workshops were held in winter 2024 and consisted of small groups of on average 10 officers, each with over 10 years of military experience, discussing the model-generated results. The results of the workshops inform the qualitative assessments of each approach (networked, relational, adaptive) that follow, while the statistical appendix uses AI-enabled scoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;option-1-using-actor-network-theory-to-imagine-a-networked-staff&quot;&gt;Option 1: Using Actor-Network Theory to Imagine a Networked Staff&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach reimagines traditional staff processes as a network of interconnected human and AI actors collaborating to generate operational knowledge and decisions. The concept aligns with Bruno Latour’s early work, which sees knowledge production not as the work of isolated individuals, but as a process of negotiations among people, data, and material artifacts. Unlike the hierarchical general staff (G-staff ) model, the Networked Staff is built around a series of “translations” at the level of functional nodes (i.e., command and control, intelligence, movement and maneuver, fires, force protection, sustainment, and information). AI agents embedded in each node dynamically process large-scale data flows, propose recommendations, and refine functional plans based on real-time feedback from across the network. This makes the network model dependent on functional agent to functional data exchange. This design also requires functional model fine-tuning and other techniques like semantic indexing and metadata enrichment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are key trade-offs in this approach. For one, planning is not neutral. Each staff process and functional node, whether human led or AI enabled, transforms knowledge into inscriptions that shape how decisions are understood and executed. These inscriptions—maps, orders, intelligence estimates, and wargaming simulations—carry biases and constraints that influence operational outcomes. Moreover, as plans are formulated, they risk falling victim to black-boxing, where the logic behind decisions becomes opaque, hidden within layers of AI-generated recommendations or simplified doctrinal templates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To counter these risks, the Networked Staff requires a fundamental shift in military planning that prioritizes adaptability, explainability, and AI-driven agentic augmentation of a series of human decisionmakers rather than merely accelerated workflows. The key structural differences in a Networked Staff include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flat, Decentralized Structure:&lt;/strong&gt; Nodes operate independently but share information dynamically, ensuring that decisionmaking is distributed rather than top-down. This design could fundamentally alter rank structures in military headquarters and staffs. This shift has the potential to increase the speed and accuracy of decisionmaking and enable new forms of collaboration that would be impossible in rigid, hierarchical command structures.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI-Driven Planning Integration:&lt;/strong&gt; AI agents analyze incoming functional data, identify patterns, and generate real-time recommendations, allowing for more agile, adaptive planning cycles. They become, in essence, the members of an operational planning team serving a smaller set of top military thinkers crafting courses of action.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seamless Cross-Node Collaboration:&lt;/strong&gt; Unlike traditional staff sections that operate in silos, the Networked Staff fosters continuous interaction among functional agents, each with a human interlocutor. This data flow will need to be managed with alerts and augmented information requirements in a similar but not fully Bayesian manner to ensure humans in the network are not overwhelmed and subject to common decisionmaking pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced Situational Awareness:&lt;/strong&gt; AI models synthesize and visualize complex operational data, making it easier for planners to interpret battlefield dynamics and assess risks. The challenge will be dimensionality and determining at what level of abstraction to assess complex and nonlinear systems that define competition and combat.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the Networked Staff to reach its full potential, the U.S. military needs to invest in computational infrastructure, deeper AI integration, and human capital development—not as a faddish tech fetish, but as a means of out-cycling adversaries like China that are almost certain to have advantages in time, space, and forces. Tempo becomes the theory of victory. The force able to generate viable options and maintain freedom of action is more responsive and resilient even if it is outnumbered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Networked Staff is a step toward faster, more adaptive functional decisionmaking, but without deliberate safeguards, it could collapse under its own complexity. Coordination without command authority risks turning a synchronized fight into a series of disconnected actions, where misaligned priorities and conflicting decisions slow the tempo rather than accelerating it. AI-driven planning floods the system with data, but more information is not the same as context and better understanding—without structure, staff officers risk drowning in insights, leading to cognitive overload, hesitation, or misplaced confidence in an incomplete picture of the fight. Cybersecurity is another Achilles’ heel—by linking every functional node in a decentralized web, the Networked Staff expands the attack surface, making it a prime target for PLA system disruption warfare, AI poisoning, and deep-penetration cyber intrusions. Overreliance on AI introduces yet another risk: If operators do not understand how AI reaches its conclusions, they will either blindly trust or outright dismiss its recommendations, both of which can lead to failure at machine speed. To make the Networked Staff a true force multiplier, the U.S. military needs to tame the chaos—structuring data flows, reinforcing cybersecurity, and integrating explainable AI to ensure that humans remain in command, not just in the loop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;STRESS-TESTING OPTION 1: COUNTERING PLA CAMPAIGNS WITH A NETWORKED STAFF&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussed in the previous section, the research team evaluated the different options for replacing legacy staff structures for a new era of agentic warfare through three foundation models and compared the results to generate the human analysis below. Specifically, the research team did multiple iterations of the same prompt structure against each model. A statistical analysis is available in the Statistical Appendix. The team then analyzed these to identify where they converged and diverged as well as to synthesize insights on the ability of a military using a Networked Staff to counter each PLA campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While all models agreed that the Networked Staff concept provided increased tempo, adaptability, and decisionmaking driven by intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), outputs differed on how resilient it would be in the face of PLA system disruption tactics and how well it would maintain operational cohesion in complex, high-intensity fights. In some of the model runs, the joint firepower strike and blockade scenarios exposed the Networked Staff’s vulnerability to cyber and electronic warfare, while the landing campaign scenario raised concerns about synchronization and the risks of decentralized functional decisionmaking in large-scale, multi-domain operations. Across all perspectives, the need for structured AI oversight, resilient communications, and human-machine synchronization protocols remained a universal recommendation to ensure the Networked Staff does not become a liability in the face of PLA system warfare doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Countering a PLA Joint Blockade&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a PLA joint blockade scenario, the Networked Staff’s ability to rapidly synthesize functional nodes gave the United States and its allies a critical edge in situational awareness. The model outputs assumed AI-driven analytics could identify patterns in PLA naval and aerial movements in a manner that enabled friendly forces to anticipate blockading maneuvers, detect maritime chokepoints, and optimize blockade countermeasures in real time. The decentralized structure would allow independent nodes to generate concepts of support and staff estimates simultaneously, reducing delays inherent in traditional G-staff decisionmaking. Additionally, the LLM outputs—across models—emphasized how cross-domain functional integration enhanced the U.S. military’s ability to disrupt PLA communications, jam targeting systems, and exploit weaknesses in China’s electronic warfare operations, eroding the blockade’s effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, some LLM outputs across models noted that conducting a counter-blockade operation required unity of effort in a manner that could prove challenging given the decentralized character of the Networked Staff alongside the concepts of translation and actants. Unlike a rigidly hierarchical PLA command structure that centralizes control over blockade operations, the Networked Staff’s distributed functional decisionmaking could lead to discrepancies in enforcement, inconsistent engagement criteria, or competing operational priorities across naval, air, and cyber domains. The resulting friction would undermine combat effectiveness. Additionally, the PLA’s system destruction warfare doctrine would target the network’s reliance on shared information flows, using cyber and electronic warfare attacks to inject false intelligence, disrupt node communication, or create decision paralysis through AI manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Surviving and Responding to a PLA Firepower Strike&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a PLA joint firepower strike scenario, the aim would be to systematically degrade U.S. and allied operational capabilities through precision multi-domain attacks targeting high-value assets such as command centers, logistics hubs, and integrated air and missile defense systems. In such an environment, the Networked Staff’s adaptability and resilience depend on the extent to which functions nodes survive the blow. Across models, the LLM outputs assumed the decentralized structure would enable forces to disperse key functions across multiple nodes, preventing a single-point failure that could cripple operations. Similarly, model outputs highlighted that AI-driven analytics allow real-time battle damage assessment and automated reallocation of surviving assets, ensuring that command continuity is preserved and friendly forces can manage maintenance and logistics required to replace combat loses and generate counterattack options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these advantages, the Networked Staff’s heavy reliance on real-time data and translations among functional nodes (i.e., actants) makes it a prime target for PLA electronic warfare and cyber operations. The PLA would likely jam communication links, inject deceptive targeting data, or disable AI-driven decision support systems, disrupting the Networked Staff’s ability to rapidly respond and coordinate a defense. Additionally, AI-generated battlefield assessments may overwhelm human operators or even produce hallucinations, leading to decision fatigue or confusion in identifying the most pressing threats during a fast-moving, high-intensity campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Defending Against a PLA Joint Landing Campaign&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a joint landing campaign in which the PLA seeks to seize key terrain and establish a lodgment for follow-on combat operations, the Networked Staff’s ability to dynamically allocate forces, synchronize multi-domain fires, and disrupt adversary landing sequences becomes a decisive advantage. Multiple LLM outputs stressed that ISR nodes could continuously track PLA amphibious and airborne movement, fusing data from intelligence functional nodes with fires nodes to preemptively strike critical transport, logistics, and command elements before they reach the shore. In addition, some model outputs emphasized how AI-driven functional wargaming simulations would support instant adaptation to new threats, ensuring that counter-landing operations are fluid and responsive rather than rigid and predetermined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, large-scale defensive operations require tight sequencing and precise coordination, areas where multiple model outputs stressed that the Networked Staff’s flat structure presents risks. Without clear hierarchical arbitration—whether via legacy or algorithmic approaches to mission command—different functional nodes might develop conflicting interpretations of the battlefield, leading to misaligned fires, redundant asset allocation, or missed opportunities to disrupt PLA landings before they gain momentum. The PLA’s electronic and cyber warfare operations would specifically target battlefield communications, further compounding this friction and disrupting the ability of friendly forces to conduct combined arms. The effect would be a digital defeat, severing ties among ISR, logistics, and maneuver elements to isolate defending forces and create openings for Chinese forces to establish a beachhead. Additionally, an overreliance on AI-generated assessments may fail to capture the true tactical complexity of landing operations, leading to misguided countermeasures based on incomplete or manipulated data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Networked Staff’s Role in Defeating PLA Offensive Campaigns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Networked Staff provides the functional coordination needed to counter multiple PLA military campaigns. By leveraging functional fusion—actants coordinating intelligence, fires, and logistics—it enables forces to counteract PLA blockades with real-time maneuvering, survive and recover from firepower strikes, and dynamically respond to landing threats before they establish a foothold. However, its greatest strength—its reliance on a highly networked, AI-enhanced decision ecosystem linked to warfighting functions—is also its greatest vulnerability. The PLA’s system destruction warfare strategy is designed to sever these networks, inject deception, and create decision paralysis that could render decentralized operations ineffective. Unlike the legacy G-staff model, which emphasizes hierarchical control and redundancy, the Networked Staff must actively compensate for its structural weaknesses by incorporating resilient communication networks, deception-resistant AI models, and structured synchronization protocols to maintain operational coherence under contested conditions. Done right, the Networked Staff can turn the PLA’s strengths—precision strikes, cyber warfare, and centralized execution—against itself, forcing the adversary into a fight it is neither optimized for nor prepared to win. But this outcome would require significant investments in computational infrastructure and training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;option-2-the-relational-staff-1&quot;&gt;Option 2: The Relational Staff&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing on Harrison White’s theory on relational sociology, this staff design moves beyond static roles and rigid chains of command, instead functioning as a constellation of interdependent functional planning agents—called netdoms—that continuously interact, adapt, and generate operational insights. A human switcher adjudicates among the output of multiple agentic netdoms, each in effect conducting parallel planning. Unlike the Networked Staff, where functional agents work alongside human staff to form actants, each agentic netdom contains multiple functional AI agents independent of staff oversight. This difference implies a trade-off between deep functional dives managed by human staff (networked) and humans playing the role of switchers and comparing outputs from multiple AI agent clusters (relational). The idea is that the human staff officer will see a wide range of variation based on multi-agent interaction rather than deep functional dives guided by staff. In other words, there are fewer people in a Relational Staff approach, and they analyze whole outputs rather than functional snapshots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, rather than relying on a linear, top-down flow of information, the Relational Staff fosters emergent decisionmaking based on evaluating how different netdoms approach solving military problems. This process has the potential to create divergent and novel findings but also to generate noise. In fact, it could create a signal-to-noise ratio challenge as it merges real-time information from the battlefield with deep contextual ideas about warfighting functions and even the history of operational art depending on how programmers train agents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, the humans in the middle of the Relational Staff will likely have to play the role of switchers. Officers will connect netdoms agents managing typical staff functions (e.g., maneuver, fires, intelligence, logistics) to ensure cross-functional collaboration that mitigates the signal-to-noise ratio challenge. Their role will be to translate insights, negotiate competing priorities, and synthesize perspectives across different domains so that staff decisions reflect an integrated real-time assessment of the battlespace. That is a tremendous amount to ask any staff officer, implying the human agent acting as switcher will need deeper training and possibly even entirely new skill sets compared to those currently taught in professional military education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the Napoleonic G-staff, where functional elements operate in bureaucratic isolation, the Relational Staff thrives on continuous dialogue, leveraging AI agents to illuminate trade-offs, risks, and opportunities across joint functions in ways that traditional processes cannot match. Key differences between the Relational Staff and legacy G-staff model designs include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interconnected Netdoms:&lt;/strong&gt; Unlike G-staff sections, which operate in isolation, netdoms are continuously linked by human switchers and AI-enhanced data flows, ensuring real-time information sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High-Connect References:&lt;/strong&gt; Unlike the Networked Staff, the Relational Staff will need to balance constant negotiations among netdoms as a source of information against deep embedding and high-context data. This difference will create deeper training for different agents. The result will likely be ontology-enhanced representations that help agents learn.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexible Orientation and Operations:&lt;/strong&gt; The G-staff requires manual coordination to reconfigure itself for different missions, whereas the Relational Staff dynamically reshapes itself in response to battlefield conditions through the process of negotiation. The main effort can shift quickly based on analytical insights.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human-Centered Analysis:&lt;/strong&gt; Given the pivotal role of human switchers, the Relational Staff is the least likely to see full autonomy in operations. Highly trained staff officers and commanders will be required to meditate negotiations among netdoms processing large volumes of information and analyzing against high-context datasets. While this staff model may have fewer people, it places a higher premium on their knowledge base, since they will have to analyze netdom output that factors in multiple warfighting functions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A core strength of this model is its ability to incorporate human intuition into AI-driven recommendations. The Relational Staff breaks from the slow, sequential logic of legacy command structures, treating decisionmaking as an ongoing negotiation rather than a bureaucratic approval process. By networking intelligence, operations, and logistics into interconnected netdoms, it dismantles the stovepipes that delay response times, replacing them with parallel, AI-enhanced collaboration that allows planning cycles to move at machine speed. Instead of drowning planners in raw data, AI agents embedded within each netdom continuously filter, refine, and prioritize insights, ensuring decisionmakers focus on strategy rather than information management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this promise, the Relational Staff introduces risks that, if left unchecked, could turn agility into chaos. Without a clear arbitration mechanism to assist human switchers in guiding how netdom agents negotiate priorities, decisionmaking could spiral into misalignment, competing priorities, or outright fragmentation. AI-driven insights could flood the system with real-time updates, filtered by domain-specific context that may obscure more than it clarifies, leaving planners struggling to interpret information. The result would be cognitive overload, decision fatigue, and delays in identifying what truly matters. Without explainable AI, commanders risk falling into one of two traps: blindly following AI outputs without question or dismissing machine-driven insights altogether, undermining the very advantage this model is designed to deliver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;STRESS-TESTING OPTION 2: COUNTERING PLA CAMPAIGNS WITH A RELATIONAL STAFF&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Relational Staff, with its AI-enhanced netdoms and human switchers, offers a flexible approach to military decisionmaking. However, its effectiveness against a PLA joint blockade, firepower strike, or landing campaign depends on how well it its agentic planning clusters—the netdoms—create viable courses of action to counter system disruption warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Countering a PLA Joint Blockade&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across models, the Relational Staff was described as posing a distinct advantage in multi-domain coordination, where air, naval, space, and cyber operations must operate in concert, orchestrated by a human-centered switcher, to counter a blockade force. Across multiple LLM outputs, there was an assumption that unlike a traditional staff with rigid silos, the Relational Staff fosters a more integrated approach, with maritime, air, and cyber netdoms continuously sharing intelligence, adapting force posture, and countering PLA maneuvers. Model outputs tended to assume that AI-driven insights within each netdom would analyze PLA movements, optimize force placement, and anticipate potential breaches, while human switchers would bridge information gaps, ensuring synchronization among communities. This structure would allow for dynamic adaptation, meaning the blockade does not operate as a static perimeter but as a fluid, evolving operational framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this very decentralization introduces coordination challenges in a prolonged blockade. Unlike the PLA’s hierarchical command system, which enforces unified action, the Relational Staff relies on negotiation among netdoms, which may lead to disjointed enforcement efforts if human switchers are disconnected or uncoordinated. The staff needs to either make a single commander the central switcher and authority, or assume the risk that multiple switchers might engage in negotiations between netdoms and each other, slowing down the flow of information and leading to conflicting objectives, and ultimately creating exploitable gaps. Additionally, the PLA’s system destruction warfare doctrine would likely target human switchers and AI-enabled netdoms, seeking to jam communications, disrupt network integrity, and inject false data into operational planning. This targeting would likely also start before a conflict and could include targeted assassinations, blackmail, and other unconventional methods to restrict the effectiveness of an AI-enabled conventional force. Highly trained switchers will be few in number, making them both a critical requirement and a critical vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Surviving and Responding to a PLA Firepower Strike&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A preponderance of model outputs described a Relational Staff that excelled in distributing decision making authority to survive a PLA joint firepower strike designed to systematically degrade command structures, ISR assets, and logistics nodes. Yet this approach was the most dependent on human operators, implying that this distribution relies on switchers surviving and quickly reconnecting data links to support the negotiation process central to a Relational Staff approach. Models tended to assume that, unlike in a traditional command structure, where a successful strike on a key headquarters could cripple operations, the Relational Staff dispersal of expertise across multiple netdoms would reduce single points of failure. That assumption depends on battle networks and concepts like mosaic more than different staff design principles, and it assumes that military organizations can rapidly replace dead switchers with new commanders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, while decentralized execution enhances survivability, it can also introduce vulnerabilities in synchronization and strike timing. Effectively responding to a multi-domain firepower strike requires tight sequencing among ISR, targeting, and engagement elements. The Relational Staff’s dependence on human switchers to mediate algorithmic negotiations could slow down kill-chain execution to human decisionmakers, vice machine at the cost of speed. Furthermore, the PLA’s ability to target the connective tissue of the Relational Staff—namely, its information-sharing architecture centered around the human switcher—creates a major weakness. By jamming netdom communications, launching cyber-intrusions into AI decision support systems, and attacking key switchers in targeting and fires domains, the PLA could degrade the cohesion of U.S. counterstrikes, creating windows of opportunity for follow-on attacks. Lastly, because of the centrality of the human switcher, the PLA could tailor cyber-enabled information operations to skew decisionmaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Defending Against a PLA Joint Landing Campaign&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the LLM outputs and model runs, PLA joint landing campaigns were characterized as requiring complex, cross-domain defense, where logistics, airpower, ISR, and maneuver forces are synchronized to deny PLA forces a foothold. The Relational Staff was well-suited to coordinate these intricate operations, as its netdoms foster multi-domain and functional integration, allowing defenders to rapidly adapt to PLA landing strategies as fast as switchers can select agentic options from competing netdoms. Unlike a rigidly hierarchical staff, which may struggle to rapidly adjust to preplanned defensive postures, the Relational Staff’s negotiation-based decision making enables it to flexibly shift resources and adapt force deployments in response to PLA maneuvers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this tightly coupled defense relies on both the quality of the human switcher and the netdom’s high-context training. A landing campaign demands tight sequencing of defensive fires, maneuver forces, and sustainment logistics, and if different netdoms interpret PLA movements differently or prioritize conflicting responses, operational cohesion could break down at a critical moment. Human switchers are also fallible to bridging the negotiation-based decisionmaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing these limitations, the PLA would target communication nodes among netdoms, using electronic warfare and cyber operations to disrupt coordination among logistics, ISR, and operational planning. If switchers become overwhelmed with competing information flows, decision latency could prevent defenders from concentrating combat power at decisive points, allowing PLA forces to establish a lodgment before the defense can fully respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Relational Staff’s Role in Defeating PLA Offensive Campaigns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Relational Staff’s AI-enhanced netdoms and human switchers provide a dynamic approach to countering PLA campaigns, but its effectiveness hinges on balancing adaptability with coordination under system disruption warfare. Against a joint blockade, its multi-domain integration ensures real-time intelligence sharing and force posture adjustments, making the blockade fluid rather than static. However, the decentralized negotiation process introduces risks in synchronization, as human switchers—critical for bridging netdoms—become high-value targets for PLA cyber, electronic, and even unconventional attacks. In a joint firepower strike scenario, the Relational Staff’s dispersal of expertise reduces single points of failure, increasing survivability, yet this advantage depends on switchers rapidly reestablishing network links to coordinate counterstrikes. The PLA’s ability to degrade communications and AI decision support could slow kill-chain execution, creating exploitable windows for follow-on attacks. In a joint landing campaign, the Relational Staff’s flexibility would enable rapid adaptation to PLA maneuvering, allowing independent netdoms fusing intelligence, fires, and logistics data to continuously adjust defensive plans. However, this approach relies heavily on the competency of switchers to bridge decision gaps, and PLA electronic warfare and cyberattacks could sever these critical links, causing decision latency at decisive moments. While the Relational Staff’s networked design fosters agility, its dependence on human mediation for synchronization introduces vulnerabilities that PLA system destruction warfare is specifically designed to exploit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;option-3-the-adaptive-staff-1&quot;&gt;Option 3: The Adaptive Staff&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing from Andrew Abbott’s insights into how professions and organizations evolve through nonlinear interactions rather than rigid structures, the Adaptive Staff approach envisions a continuously evolving system built around feedback loops connecting human and machines, as well as clusters of agents to support faster adaption to shifting operational realities. As a model for replacing the Napoleonic staff, it sits between the previous approaches, envisioning more agent autonomy than the Network Staff and less reliance on human switchers than the Relational Staff. Unlike traditional hierarchical staff models, which rely on static roles and bureaucratic workflows, or even the Relational Staff, which depends on switching, the Adaptive Staff structures decisionmaking around iterative cycles of planning, execution, and assessment that operate faster than legacy processes, essentially accelerating and fusing mission command and deliberate planning. This iteration requires higher degrees of model fine-tuning in relation to human feedback and key context including military theory and history independent of functional considerations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas the Networked Staff disperses decisionmaking across functionally independent nodes, and the Relational Staff emphasizes human switchers adjudicating clusters of functional agents, the Adaptive Staff treats decisionmaking as a continuous, iterative process, where AI agents and human facilitators work in tandem to generate, refine, and adjust plans based on real-time data. Each process—whether intelligence fusion, operational planning, logistics coordination, or fires management—is linked to others in a way that ensures synchronization without rigid command hierarchies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, AI is not merely a tool for processing vast amounts of information—it must be embedded within deeper knowledge ontologies that allow for contextual interpretation of contingent events. Abbott’s work underscores the limitations of cause-and-effect modeling in social phenomena, a critical insight for military organizations seeking to integrate AI into complex decisionmaking processes. Rather than simply analyzing historical patterns, AI must be paired with reinforcement learning with human feedback to capture emergent battlefield dynamics and unforeseen variables based on evolving human judgment and collective intelligence. This approach prevents AI from becoming overly deterministic or optimizing for efficiency at the expense of adaptability. Key differences between the Adaptive Staff and the Networked and Relational Staff include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic, Process-Oriented Structure:&lt;/strong&gt; Unlike the Networked Staff, which relies on decentralized, function-specific nodes, or the Relational Staff, which organizes around netdoms mediated by human switchers, the Adaptive Staff operates through interdependent processes that continuously refine decisionmaking based on real-time feedback loops that change the system. Unlike the G-staff, which is organized around functional sections that operate in parallel but often in isolation, the Adaptive Staff structures decisionmaking around fluid, interacting processes that continuously feed information into one another, preventing stovepipes and lag in operational assessments but also creating the risk of chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iterative Decisionmaking Over Static Hierarchies:&lt;/strong&gt; While the Networked Staff flattens decisionmaking into distributed nodes exchanging information (i.e., actants and translation), and the Relational Staff prioritizes collaboration among netdom agents, the Adaptive Staff continuously revises its courses of action through structured iteration, ensuring that no decision is ever final but instead always subject to improvement based on feedback from the environment, agentic analysis, and even simulated outcomes derived from autonomous wargames run thousands if not millions of times in search of optimal conditions. While traditional staffs rely on step-by-step sequential planning (e.g., intelligence feeds operations, which in turn direct logistics, and so on), the Adaptive Staff allows for real-time iteration, recognizing that warfare does not unfold in a linear cause-and-effect sequence. This dynamic puts a premium on agent-generated branches and sequels and generating large numbers of options, often invisible to the human eye, to test possible scenarios. These simulated tactics and even whole courses of action provide reference points (i.e., synthetic data) to guide how agents respond to inevitable change in the environment. The value of this approach only increases when the adaptive staff integrates AI agents trained and weighted toward a perspective outside of traditional military planning, such as economic and diplomatic actions. Integrating these whole-of-government approaches in an Adaptive Staff would lead to uniquely effective options, emerging from a staff thinking in wholes rather than a myopic military lens.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI as a Cognitive Enabler, Not Just a Data Processor:&lt;/strong&gt; While all three models integrate AI to enhance decisionmaking, the Adaptive Staff differs in that AI is embedded within processes, not just as a tool for automation but as a mechanism for refining, contextualizing, and learning from human decisions. AI agents are not just tools for information processing but integrated actors within the decisionmaking cycle, influencing planning and execution in real time, unlike the G-staff model, where intelligence products are generated in discrete cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emergent Order over Predefined Structures:&lt;/strong&gt; The Networked Staff functions as a decentralized collection of nodes that interact horizontally, and the Relational Staff operates through negotiated relationships between netdoms, but the Adaptive Staff actively reconstructs itself in response to operational contingencies, ensuring that no plan is ever static. Rather than relying solely on pattern-matching from historical datasets, AI within the Adaptive Staff is trained to incorporate human feedback, operational art, and historical analogies, ensuring that contingency and emergent behavior are factored into decisionmaking.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Adaptive Staff enhances agility and responsiveness, making it ideal for complex, multi-domain conflicts where rapid shifts in the operational environment demand continuous reassessment. By operationalizing interconnected processes, it ensures that planning, execution, and assessment operate as continuous loops rather than discrete, linear steps. This avoids the pitfalls of both traditional staff models, which often suffer from bureaucratic inertia, and the Networked Staff, which may struggle with synchronization due to negotiations among functionally independent nodes. AI-driven analytics enhance situational awareness, detecting patterns, shifts in adversary behavior, and potential opportunities or threats faster than human planners—the switchers in the Relational Staff. This removes potential bottlenecks caused by misalignment across netdoms while still maintaining flexibility and adaptability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Adaptive Staff is designed to enhance resilience and agility, it introduces risks that must be actively managed to prevent fragmentation, cognitive overload, and susceptibility to cyber threats. Unlike the Relational Staff, which is rooted in human switchers mediating how netdom agents exchange information, or the Networked Staff, which operates through translations among predefined function-specific nodes, the Adaptive Staff lacks a fixed structure—presenting a double-edged sword. Its fluidity allows for rapid iteration, but in high-intensity conflicts, coordination failures could emerge if facilitators fail to align operational priorities across interdependent processes. If competing AI-generated recommendations are not reconciled effectively, decisionmaking could become chaotic rather than adaptive. This challenge is compounded by the existing military education, training, and professional-development paradigms that emphasize static hierarchical structures. Emergent, rhizomatic organizational structures stand in near diametric opposition to military operation paradigms. This mismatch creates significant risk to adopting the Adaptive Staff design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An additional challenge is managing information overload. While AI enables real-time intelligence processing and course-of-action refinement, it also generates vast volumes of data that could overwhelm human facilitators shifting through background options and a collage of courses of action generated by agents searching alternative futures for advantage. Unlike the Networked Staff, which allows for compartmentalization within function-specific nodes, the Adaptive Staff processes are deeply interconnected, increasing the likelihood of decision fatigue if information flows are not properly managed and presented to human decisionmakers. The Adaptive Staff will require more humans than the Relational Staff, but they will have to be just as well trained and educated to interact with multiple functional agents across planning and execution considerations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;STRESS-TESTING OPTION 3: COUNTERING PLA CAMPAIGNS WITH AN ADAPTIVE STAFF&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Adaptive Staff’s process-driven, iterative approach provides a unique advantage in countering a PLA joint blockade, surviving a joint firepower strike, and defending against a joint landing campaign. Across LLM outputs, the Adaptive Staff was consistently characterized as the most capable of leveraging real-time monitoring, AI-enhanced assessment processes, and dynamic force reallocation to maintain the operational advantage against PLA system destruction warfare. Unlike the Relational Staff, which relies on human switchers negotiating among netdoms, or the Networked Staff, which disperses decisionmaking across independent function-based nodes, the Adaptive Staff continuously synchronizes planning, execution, and assessment, ensuring that responses evolve dynamically to meet battlefield conditions. However, this adaptability introduces vulnerabilities, as the reliance on iterative decision cycles and feedback loops creates risks of operational fragmentation, cyber manipulation, and decision latency under contested conditions. Effectively countering PLA campaigns with the Adaptive Staff requires robust redundancy measures, AI deception resistance, and clear thresholds for decisionmaking under uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Countering a PLA Joint Blockade&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of LLM outputs across the models characterized the Adaptive Staff as best suited to leverage real-time monitoring and rapid adaption across multiple domains to counter a PLA joint blockade. The outputs characterized AI-enhanced planning processes as continuously generating a range of new options based on changing maritime, air, and cyber conditions, allowing facilitators to dynamically adjust interdiction strategies in response to PLA maneuvers, electronic warfare tactics, and missile threats. Unlike the Relational Staff, which relies on human switchers to negotiate among netdom agents, or the Networked Staff, which operates through translation among functionally independent nodes, the Adaptive Staff maintains an iterative, process-driven decision cycle, ensuring that planning, execution, and assessment continuously inform one another. This continuous feedback loop prevents bureaucratic lag and allows the blockade to function as an adaptive operational framework rather than a static defensive perimeter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, constantly responding to feedback loops could undermine unity of effort. Furthermore, it could create an information tax as agents awaiting updates thus delay tempo, a situation the PLA could compound through cyber and electronic attacks. The Adaptive Staff’s strength in fluid decisionmaking could become a vulnerability if the PLA systematically degrades key AI-human integration points, jams real-time synchronization mechanisms, or introduces false data streams into AI-driven assessments to create disjointed operational responses. Without structured redundancy and resilient data validation measures, along with conditional logic gates that determine when environment feedback is sufficient for action, the Adaptive Staff risks decision fragmentation, allowing the PLA to exploit gaps in blockade enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Surviving and Responding to a PLA Firepower Strike&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Model outputs also consistently presented the Adaptive Staff as well suited to respond to a joint firepower strike. LLM responses across the three different foundation models (i.e., ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude) characterized this approach as denying the PLA a single set of high-value targets. This assumes, again, a battle network architecture that is distributed, resilient, and has sufficient computational power and connectivity to update AI models and analyze possible planning scenarios. This architecture allows the Adaptive Staff to rapidly restructure command relationships and authorities based on environmental feedback—for example, optimizing fires allocation based on battle damage assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this fluidity introduces risks in decision clarity and synchronization of fires across multiple domains. The PLA’s doctrine of systems confrontation is designed to exploit vulnerabilities in process-dependent networks, and if AI-driven recommendations overwhelm facilitators with conflicting targeting priorities, the strike response could become desynchronized. Moreover, the reliance on AI-generated insights in a contested electromagnetic environment could introduce cyber vulnerabilities, with PLA forces actively jamming data flows or injecting false targeting recommendations that cause strange loops as the Adaptive Staff’s model of the battlefield changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Defending Against a PLA Joint Landing Campaign&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple models and LLM outputs also described how the Adaptive Staff would enable a force to deny a joint landing campaign. A PLA joint landing campaign represents one of the most complex operational challenges, requiring multi-domain coordination to deny beachheads, disrupt airborne forces, and neutralize supporting fires. The Adaptive Staff’s strength lies in its ability to dynamically synchronize defensive operations, ensuring that ISR, logistics, fires, and maneuver forces adjust in real time to PLA actions as feedback loops, essentially aligning options against possible futures as they emerge. Unlike the Relational Staff, in which negotiation across netdom agents could slow rapid countermoves, the Adaptive Staff allows for immediate shifts in operational priorities, keeping pace with PLA advances and logistical constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this high degree of adaptation comes at the cost of operational cohesion. A landing scenario requires precise sequencing of defensive actions, and the Adaptive Staff’s decentralized processes and dependence on feedback loops may create decision bottlenecks in moments that demand intuition and rapid top-down command authority. Additionally, the reliance on AI-driven assessments could introduce transparency issues, as commanders may struggle to trace how specific defensive recommendations were generated and whether critical battlefield adjustments align with strategic intent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Adaptive Staff’s Role in Defeating PLA Offensive Campaigns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Adaptive Staff’s ability to rapidly process environmental feedback and restructure decisionmaking cycles provides an asymmetric advantage against PLA military campaigns, its strength in adaptability can also create vulnerabilities in coordination, tempo, and resilience in the face of information warfare (e.g., cyber, electronic, and propaganda operations). Against a joint blockade, the Adaptive Staff optimizes interdiction through dynamic force adjustments, but without safeguards against cyber and electronic warfare, it risks decision fragmentation and exploitable operational gaps. In a firepower strike scenario, its distributed nature enhances survivability, yet overreliance on AI-generated recommendations in a contested electromagnetic environment could lead to synchronization failures. Finally, in a joint landing campaign, its fluid decisionmaking enables rapid countermoves, but the absence of structured command authority may slow critical responses during high-stakes engagements. To fully leverage its advantages while mitigating its risks, the Adaptive Staff must integrate structured redundancy, deception-resistant AI, and explicit decision thresholds to prevent operational paralysis under adversarial disruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;comparative-evaluation-of-ai-agentic-warfare-staff-models&quot;&gt;Comparative Evaluation of AI Agentic Warfare Staff Models&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expanding on the original research findings, the research team conducted a comparative analysis evaluating how three leading LLMs—ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini—assessed the performance of the Networked, Relational, and Adaptive Staff models against notional PLA campaigns. These assessments, paired with a structured analysis of variance (ANOVA), not only confirmed the overall superiority of the Adaptive Staff but also offered critical insights into where different AI agentic warfare staff structures would likely succeed or fail based on campaign demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across all three models, the Adaptive Staff consistently outperformed its alternatives. It achieved the highest mean score (4.39) compared to the Relational Staff (3.90) and Networked Staff (3.59), a difference that was statistically significant according to ANOVA results (p &amp;lt; 0.05). This quantitative superiority reflects the Adaptive Staff’s underlying design principles: a dynamic, process-oriented structure emphasizing real-time feedback, contextual learning, and iterative decisionmaking. These attributes align closely with the challenges posed by PLA system confrontation warfare, particularly the need for rapid operational reconfiguration under cyber and electronic duress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;strong&gt;joint blockade campaign&lt;/strong&gt;, Gemini’s analysis aligned with Claude’s findings in recognizing the Adaptive Staff’s strength, emphasizing its real-time monitoring and dynamic adjustment capabilities linking planning and execution. However, Gemini placed greater emphasis on the vulnerabilities of the Networked Staff, particularly its challenges in maintaining operational cohesion under stress, a concern that was less pronounced in Claude’s evaluation. Claude highlighted the Relational Staff’s ability to better enable multi-domain coordination, but Gemini’s analysis noted the risk of disjointed enforcement due to the Relational Staff’s reliance on human switchers. ChatGPT similarly aligned with Claude, stressing the Adaptive Staff’s superior responsiveness and decisionmaking capacity. Notably, ChatGPT provided an even stronger endorsement of the Adaptive Staff model, offering it a clear numerical advantage over other models. In contrast to Claude’s moderate concerns about Networked Staff cybersecurity risks, ChatGPT categorically downgraded its viability. Likewise, while Claude identified coordination challenges in the Relational Staff, ChatGPT more severely criticized its limited operational effectiveness under blockade conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;strong&gt;joint firepower strike campaign&lt;/strong&gt;, both Gemini and Claude again identified the Adaptive Staff as the superior performer, particularly for its assumed ability to adapt, making it harder for the PLA to concentrate fires against high-value targets. Gemini placed more emphasis on the dangers of decision fatigue from high-volume AI-generated battlefield assessments than Claude did. Similarly, ChatGPT concurred with Claude on the Adaptive Staff’s strengths, especially its distributed resilience. However, ChatGPT rated the Networked Staff’s performance lower than Claude, emphasizing greater concerns about synchronization failures and information saturation. Unlike Claude, which acknowledged some relational model contributions, ChatGPT marked the Relational Staff’s performance as distinctly secondary, stressing the risks of human bottlenecks in rapidly evolving battlespaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;strong&gt;joint landing campaign&lt;/strong&gt;, the Gemini analysis diverged slightly from Claude. Claude strongly favored the Relational Staff, highlighting its ability to facilitate complex, cross-domain defensive operations through robust human-AI teaming. Gemini, however, viewed the Adaptive Staff as a near-equal competitor, emphasizing its dynamic synchronization capabilities and ability to adapt under evolving battlefield conditions. Gemini also raised concerns about potential decision bottlenecks in the Adaptive Staff model due to its reliance on feedback loops, although these concerns were less prominent in Claude’s evaluation. ChatGPT largely agreed with Claude in recognizing the Relational Staff’s strength in coordinating defenses during large-scale amphibious assaults. However, ChatGPT, like Gemini, rated the Adaptive Staff nearly as highly, emphasizing its structured feedback-driven adaptability. Importantly, ChatGPT more explicitly highlighted the potential vulnerabilities of the Adaptive Staff model, specifically the risk of feedback loop dependencies leading to decision delays in high-intensity, decentralized operations—a subtle but important distinction compared to Claude’s assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, an antithesis emerges when considering the importance of human judgment in the early stages of a blockade. Historical examples, such as the Cuban Missile Crisis and the restraint shown by Soviet submarine commanders, underscore the critical role that human decisionmakers can play in preventing escalation. In scenarios characterized by ambiguous rules of engagement and high political stakes, human switchers embedded within the Relational Staff could provide vital discretion at the tactical edge, ensuring that localized actions do not inadvertently escalate into broader conflicts. While the AI-driven Adaptive Staff offers speed and dynamic adjustment, it may lack the intuitive judgment necessary to interpret subtle political cues or apply proportional responses under strategic ambiguity. Thus, relational models, despite their vulnerabilities, offer an irreplaceable safeguard during the initial, unstable phases of blockade operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Relational Staff’s human-mediated discretion is invaluable under certain political-military conditions, the broader operational environment demands an organization be capable of adapting to an emergent complexity at speed and scale. The Adaptive Staff, with its dynamic, iterative structure and continuous feedback loops, best meets these demands. Its ability to process real-time information, adjust operational designs fluidly, and maintain resilience under systemic adversarial disruption ensures that it can both mitigate escalation risks when necessary and transition rapidly to decisive operational maneuver once clarity emerges. Therefore, despite the critical role of human judgment early in crisis scenarios, the adaptive staff remains the optimal foundation for future military operations characterized by complexity, speed, and uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the comparative analysis highlights the operational advantages of the Adaptive Staff, translating these insights into practical implementation demands deliberate policy and organizational action. As adversaries such as the PLA continue to refine strategies aimed at degrading decisionmaking and disrupting operational tempo, the DOD must ensure that future command structures are not only technologically advanced but also resilient and adaptable under contested conditions. An agentic staff model without corresponding investments in cybersecurity, synchronization protocols, and human-machine teaming architectures risks replicating the very vulnerabilities it seeks to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, even the most adaptive technical systems must be complemented by human personnel trained to operate in complex, degraded, and ambiguous environments. Building future staffs requires a dual focus: enhancing technological capacity while cultivating adaptive cognitive frameworks among leaders and operators. The ability to balance algorithmic recommendations with human judgment, particularly in high-stakes, politically charged scenarios, will define the effectiveness of AI-integrated military operations in the coming decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, strategic investment decisions must account for the dynamic nature of agentic warfare itself. The iterative, feedback-driven nature of the Adaptive Staff suggests that future operational designs will not be static. Instead, they will require continuous experimentation, rigorous red-teaming, and the rapid institutionalization of lessons learned. Organizations that fail to build these adaptive learning cycles into the very fabric of command and control risk falling behind faster-evolving adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the DOD and Congress consider the future of AI-enabled military decisionmaking, investment in resilient, adaptive, and secure staff structures is critical. The Networked Staff, Relational Staff, and Adaptive Staff models each offer advantages in speed, agility, and operational integration, but also introduce new risks that must be actively managed. Across these models, three core challenges emerge:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ensure coordination and synchronization in decentralized, AI-enhanced decisionmaking environments.&lt;/strong&gt; The findings consistently showed that while decentralized decisionmaking structures like the Networked and Relational Staff models enhanced tempo and flexibility, they introduced substantial risks of fragmentation, conflicting priorities, and desynchronization—especially under adversary pressure during blockade, firepower strike, and landing scenarios. These risks were most pronounced in scenarios where distributed nodes operated without clear arbitration mechanisms, as observed in the expert discussions on system disruption vulnerabilities. Coordination protocols, synchronized command logic, and robust human oversight mechanisms must be deliberately designed to counteract these risks, ensuring unity of effort even in highly distributed operational environments. These efforts will require assigning an agency and common protocols for evaluating agentic experiments. Standards matter and must be governed in the military to ensure a framework for adapting and scaling alternatives to the Napoleonic staff construct.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build cybersecurity resilience against adversary system destruction warfare, particularly PLA cyber and electronic attacks.&lt;/strong&gt; Across all campaign scenarios, the LLM analyses and expert evaluations stressed that PLA system destruction doctrine would target the network dependencies, information-sharing architectures, and real-time data flows critical to agentic staffs. This threat was particularly acute for the Networked Staff, where reliance on real-time AI inputs and decentralized decision nodes created expanded attack surfaces. Findings indicated that without hardened communication nodes, deception-resistant AI models, and resilience by design in information networks, even highly adaptive structures like the Adaptive Staff could be systematically degraded. Investments must therefore prioritize survivability of communications, deception filtering, and cyber hardening to ensure decision continuity under contested electromagnetic conditions. Sadly, these are often afterthoughts in budget submissions, meaning the DOD will need to play a more proactive role in requiring deeper cybersecurity investments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Train personnel to operate effectively in AI-integrated command structures while maintaining human oversight and adaptability in degraded conditions.&lt;/strong&gt; This study has repeatedly highlighted the crucial role of human facilitators (in the Adaptive Staff) and human switchers (in the Relational Staff) as critical nodes ensuring synchronization, context-driven decisionmaking, and error mitigation. Across all models, the success of AI-human integration depended on personnel trained not only to interpret AI outputs but also to actively manage feedback loops, prioritize conflicting insights, and preserve operational cohesion under dynamic conditions. Without deeper professional military education reforms emphasizing AI literacy, agent orchestration, critical reasoning under uncertainty, and dynamic decision control, future staffs risk either over-trusting or underutilizing AI systems, amplifying vulnerabilities exposed in scenarios like firepower strikes and contested landings. Thus, human capital development must be a central pillar of agentic warfare transformation. Given that this will extend across services, the Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness likely has a large role to play in mandating changes to policy along these lines.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these insights frame the following recommendations, which outline key investments and policy measures needed to operationalize AI-enabled staffs while mitigating their vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. Launch a multiyear campaign of experimentation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The single most important thing the DOD can do is sustain aggressive experiments that test different approaches to building new staff structures better suited to agentic warfare than their Napoleonic precursors. This will require an agile approach to experimentation that, consistent with the CDAO’s Global Information Dominance Experiment (GIDE), uses live user feedback to iteratively develop and field prototypes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Launch a follow-on to GIDE that tests different staff organizations against a common set of threat scenarios. These experiments should take the form of wargames, ideally linked to standing PLA campaigns, at both unclassified and secret levels. Using a mix of open and closed games will support a broader network of evaluation and analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create and fund a congressionally mandated reporting cycle that ensures a mix of service, DOD, and external evaluations are presented to DOD leadership, likely the deputy secretary of defense, with Congress tracking progress. These evaluations should focus on benchmarking AI models relative to different military missions and provide external evaluation of progress made in deploying AI agents.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Leverage opportunities through the J7/G7 to connect the campaign of experimentation to professional military education to ensure both a common pool of players in game-driven experiments and opportunities to connect the campaign to ongoing student research. These games should provide both a test bed and a feedback mechanism for fine-tuning models and optimizing AI agents.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. Invest in computational infrastructure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A robust computational backbone is essential to ensure seamless integration of AI across decisionmaking nodes, enabling high-speed, secure, and resilient communication even in contested environments. Despite calls for broad budget cuts, it is not clear the DOD currently has the depth of computational infrastructure required to support agentic warfare in peacetime, much less in contested wartime environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Launch a study to estimate the following: (1) current DOD computational infrastructure; (2) estimates for how much more computational power might be required to wage agentic warfare; and (3) options for addressing any gap.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Invest in high-performance computing and distributed AI processing to allow for real-time analysis at the edge of operations, even when disconnected from centralized networks. These investments should be linked to the aforementioned study and include cooperative efforts with entities like the National Science Foundation and Department of Commerce to ensure there is a robust, resilient network of infrastructure required to both run an information-age economy and support the emergence of agentic warfare.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prototype scalable cloud and edge computing solutions that enable staff structures to operate autonomously in degraded environments on classified networks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enhance secure, high-speed networking architectures to maintain decision continuity under adversary cyber and electronic warfare attacks. This should include parallel red-teaming events during the campaign of experimentation that explore both traditional cybersecurity and new concepts to combat adversary bots that seek to deliberately poison data used by agents.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3. Train and integrate AI for military decisionmaking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure AI serves as a force multiplier rather than a liability, models must be carefully trained, integrated, and refined through operational feedback. This effort will require a broad-based educational renaissance across the U.S. military. Assuming that the United States can wage agentic warfare without warriors who understand it would be a recipe for disaster akin to historic failures like the 1942 Battle of the Savo Strait, when sailors did not understand how to use new radars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Invest in explainable AI initiatives that ensure AI models provide transparent, auditable recommendations rather than black-box outputs. These investments should build on earlier Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) efforts in this area and create new ways of better integrating university-aligned research.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sustain a campaign of experimentation across professional military education that refines AI models through wargaming and operational exercises, leveraging real-world feedback to improve model reliability and contextual adaptability. Just as interwar education focused on decision games and map exercises, there is an opportunity to help officers learn about modern joint all-domain warfare while generating new approaches to agentic warfare in the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Work with the J7/G7 and key combatant commands like U.S. Indo-Pacific Command to leverage the iterated wargames discussed above to propose entirely new approaches to generating staff estimates and plans. This process will likely include reimagining the deliberate planning process and finding better ways to align crisis and contingency planning. This study should directly engage schoolhouse experimentation and identify key gaps including adjustments to professional education as well as command and control systems and computational infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Build and test new decisionmaking protocols for agentic staffs. This effort should include mechanisms for building an AI-enabled decision audit trail and testing protocols for dealing with comms-degraded environments almost certain to impact the performance of AI agents by limiting information updates.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;4. Build resilience against PLA system disruption warfare.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PLA’s doctrine of system confrontation specifically targets AI-reliant networks, making agentic staff and their vulnerability surface and cybersecurity standards a foundational requirement for any AI-integrated staff model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Develop new concepts for defending agentic networks at both the service and combatant command levels. This should include, but is not limited to, (1) deploying redundant communication systems and AI deception detection measures to ensure decisionmaking continuity under contested conditions; and (2) employing network segmentation and zero-trust security protocols to prevent adversary lateral movement within staff systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Train AI models using adversarial learning techniques, ensuring they can identify and counteract PLA efforts to deceive and manipulate an agentic staff. This effort to train agents to detect deception should extend to the aforementioned campaign of learning and iterated approach to learning through games to design and fight an agentic staff.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;5. Enhance human capital for AI-driven decisionmaking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personnel remain the critical link between AI-driven insights and strategic execution. Training programs must equip staff officers with the skills necessary to operate in decentralized, AI-augmented environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Develop AI literacy programs focused on data analysis, visualization, and AI optimization techniques (e.g., few-shot learning and retrieval-augmented generation). This should include training officers in structured decision arbitration, ensuring they can synchronize competing AI recommendations without creating decision bottlenecks. While the J7/G7 can mandate this training, the DOD should coordinate with the services and Congress to ensure it is properly resourced.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Train personnel in AI-human teaming strategies, ensuring they can interpret, challenge, and validate AI-driven recommendations rather than blindly accepting them. This training will need to be continuous and mix individual and collective training events. For example, imagine a U.S. Army soldier taking an online course on prompt engineering and asking tactical questions and analyzing model-generated content using red-teaming techniques. This process can include learning agents tailored to the soldier that aggregates data to help the commander better understand his formation and support mission command. Similar to the previous recommendation, while the J7 can mandate a requirement, the services and Congress need to be brought into the discussion to ensure that new education requirements are matched with resources.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create new approaches to lessons learned that capture synthetic data and establish real-time tracking, after-action assessments, and automated feedback loops to continuously improve AI performance and synchronization mechanisms. This process should be built from the bottom up, starting at service-level lessons learned and merging into joint structures. To be effective, it will require funding a mix of data scientists and computational infrastructure to support the effort, much of which could build on the existing Advana system deployed across the DOD.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agentic warfare is becoming a reality. AI-enabled military staff structures offer transformational advantages in speed, adaptability, and operational integration, but their success depends on strategic investment in infrastructure, cybersecurity, and human-AI collaboration. Without deliberate safeguards, the PLA’s system destruction warfare approach could exploit AI dependencies, disrupt synchronization, and degrade decisionmaking effectiveness. To ensure U.S. military staffs remain resilient and operationally dominant, the DOD and Congress should prioritize investments in computational capacity, AI training, cyber resilience, and structured decision frameworks. By embedding redundancy, explainability, and continuous optimization into AI-driven decisionmaking, the U.S. military can leverage AI as a strategic advantage rather than a potential vulnerability in twenty-first-century warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;statistical-appendix&quot;&gt;Statistical Appendix&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tables below provide the data documentation for each scenario run by model. The first table reports the complete scoring across models and PLA scenario types. All scoring was based on providing the same inputs to the models as discussed in the report to ensure consistent prompts and context that supported comparative statistical analysis of the outputs. The subsequent tables analyze how each AI agent staff performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) single-factor analysis. In this study, ANOVA provides insights on statistically significant differences across the models in general, and in particular scores the AI agents’ performance across different PLA campaign scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each table contains a summary section and an ANOVA Table. The summary table section is organized into the following columns:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Groups: The different models being compared (Networked, Relational, Adaptive).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Count: Number of observations (i.e., how many scores were collected per group; here, it is 90 for each model).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sum: Total of all the scores for each model.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Average: Mean score for each model.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Variance: Statistical variance showing how spread out the scores are within each model group.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ANOVA table is organized into the following columns:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Source of Variation: Divides the variance into “Between Groups” (differences between models) and “Within Groups” (variance inside each model).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sum of Squares (SS): Measures variability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Degrees of Freedom (df ): Number of values free to vary.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mean Square (MS): SS divided by df.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The F-statistic (F): (MS Between / MS Within) used to determine if group means are statistically significantly different.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;P value: Critical for interpreting ANOVA—if p &amp;lt; 0.05, the difference between group means is considered statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;F critical: The critical value from F-distribution tables to compare against the F-statistic.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the P value is less than 0.05, it suggests that there are statistically significant differences between at least some of the model ratings. In addition, if the F statistic is larger than F critical, it confirms that the differences between groups are statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an ideal scenario of AI-enabled scoring, there would be robust differences in scoring across the agentic staff approaches. This would include statistically significant differences between networked, relational, and adaptive designs, both overall and across different PLA campaign scenarios; and minimal differences between models, with either no statistically significant differences in the mean scores or minimal differences (i.e., a small difference in F statistic and F critical). Combined, these data trends would indicate more robust support for one staff design over its counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/RwvINPt.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 2: ANOVA: Single-Factor Combined Analysis Across PLA Scenarios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As seen in Table 1 above, all three AI foundation models (i.e., ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini) rated the Adaptive Staff the highest across all three PLA campaign scenarios. It had the highest average performance score (4.39), and the F statistic is greater than the F critical, reinforcing the finding that the means are different between groups (networked, relational, adaptive) and the difference is statistically significant. Though generated by AI-enabled scoring, these insights reinforce the qualitative assessment that the Adaptive Staff is the best candidate for initial agentic staff experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/RVnvTyf.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 3: ANOVA: Single-Factor Combined Analysis of the Joint Blockade Scenario&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 2 reports the findings just for blockade scenarios. Statistical analysis using a single-factor ANOVA confirmed significant differences in AI scoring across the staff models. The Adaptive Staff achieved the highest mean score of 4.07, outperforming the Relational Staff (mean 3.60) and the Networked Staff (mean 3.37). The F statistic is greater than the F critical, reinforcing the finding that the means are different between groups (Networked, Relational, and Adaptive) and the difference is statistically significant. These results reinforce the broader findings: The Adaptive Staff maintained its assessed advantage across multiple evaluation runs, providing robust support for its prioritization in future agentic warfare force design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/VPYtWu3.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 4: ANOVA: Single-Factor Combined Analysis of the Joint Firepower Strike Scenario&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the joint firepower strike scenario, single-factor ANOVA results demonstrated clear performance differentiation among the staff models. The Adaptive Staff again achieved the highest mean score (4.4), edging out the Networked Staff (4.10) and significantly outperforming the Relational Staff (3.50). The F statistic is greater than F critical—though the magnitude was smaller than in the joint blockade analysis—reinforcing the finding that the means are different between groups (networked, relational, adaptive) and the difference is statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/fyLhjKP.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 5: ANOVA: Single-Factor Combined Analysis of the Joint Landing Scenario&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the joint landing campaign scenario, the ANOVA results highlight a notable shift compared to the blockade and firepower findings. While the Adaptive Staff dominated performance in both the blockade and firepower scenarios, the Relational Staff emerged as the top performer in the landing scenario, achieving the highest mean score of 4.60. This significantly exceeded the Adaptive Staff (4.23) and the Networked Staff (mean 3.30). The F statistic is greater than the F critical, reinforcing the finding that the means are different between groups (networked, relational, adaptive) and the difference is statistically significant. These findings suggest that unlike in blockade or firepower campaigns, where dynamic adaptation and distributed decisionmaking are paramount, complex cross-domain operations like an amphibious landing may benefit more from the human-machine teaming, coordinated judgment, and synchronized operational integration that characterize the Relational Staff model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/j75mxYK.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 6: ANOVA: Single-Factor Analysis of Networked Staff Agents by Model&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Networked Staff had varying results across models. Claude gave the AI agentic approach the highest score (3.83), and the result was statistically significant. Furthermore, the F statistic is greater than the F critical—albeit only slightly—reinforcing the finding that the means are different between groups (networked, relational, adaptive) and the difference is statistically significant. In other words, there are small but statistically significant differences in how AI foundation models scored the Networked Staff across the three PLA campaign scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/tOuRmgB.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 7: ANOVA: Single-Factor Analysis of Relational Staff Agents by Model&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As seen in the table above, unlike with the Networked Staff, there were no statistically significant differences in how the three foundation models scored the agentic warfare approach across the three PLA campaign scenarios. The F Statistic was also smaller than the F critical, reinforcing this finding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/HY9gp2H.png&quot; alt=&quot;image12&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 8: ANOVA: Single-Factor Analysis of Adaptive Staff Agent by Model&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The table above analyzes how the three foundation models compare in their ratings for the Adaptive Staff approach across the three PLA campaign scenarios. Similar to the Networked Staff scoring, there are small but statistically significant differences across the models, with ChatGPT scoring the adaptive approach slightly higher (4.6) than Claude and Gemini. All three foundation models scored the Adaptive Staff higher than the alternatives despite the small difference in mean scoring across them. Furthermore, the F statistic is greater than the F critical—albeit only slightly—reinforcing the finding that the means are different between groups (networked, relational, adaptive) and the difference is statistically significant. In other words, there are small but statistically significant differences in how AI foundation models scored the Adaptive Staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is increasingly weaponizing its chokehold over critical minerals amid intensifying economic and technological competition with the United States. The critical mineral gallium, which is crucial to defense industry supply chains and new energy technologies, has been at the front line of China’s strategy. To date, China’s chokehold on rare earth metals has attracted more attention than its restrictions on gallium, and some have downplayed the potential consequences of disruptions to gallium supply chains. Yet CSIS analysis reveals the extent to which China can wield gallium to impose significant economic harm on the United States and its allies and partners. This CSIS Brief unpacks the scope of the problem and offers policy recommendations on how to bolster U.S. and allied economic security and deny China a key tool of economic warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction-and-key-findings&quot;&gt;Introduction and Key Findings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid spiraling trade tensions with the United States, Beijing has brandished a new arsenal of economic weapons, with few proving more potent than its export controls on critical minerals. As of May 2025, China had restricted the export of at least 16 key minerals and alloys, many of which are essential inputs for products ranging from consumer electronics to F-35 fighter jets. These measures have struck deep into U.S. and allied supply chains, and appear to have given China substantial leverage in its ongoing trade and technology negotiations with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the impacts of these controls hit global markets, examining the case of gallium—a little-known but crucial metal—offers a powerful warning signal. China has a near-total monopoly over gallium production, accounting for a startling 98 percent of the world’s primary supply. The mineral was among the first to be caught in the escalating tit-for-tat trade restrictions between the United States and China, making headlines when it landed on Beijing’s export control list (alongside germanium) in July 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That initial broadside was largely a warning shot designed to showcase Beijing’s capacity to impose pain on sensitive U.S. supply chains while limiting broader impacts on the global economy. Now, China is tightening the screws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New research by CSIS, supported by data provided by minerals supply chain intelligence company Rovjok, reveals that China’s gallium restrictions are having a greater impact than previously anticipated. This is due to both tighter enforcement against transshipment and new controls on specialized gallium extraction technologies that are not available outside China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brief presents several key findings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s gallium export controls have incrementally tightened in response to expanding U.S. technology restrictions. Its measures have ratcheted up from licensing requirements and end-user controls to a total export ban targeting the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Global dependence on Chinese primary gallium is now causing a gallium supply crunch that may soon impact key production lines as firms draw down their stockpiles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s most recent round of export controls on gallium extraction technologies could impede U.S. and allied efforts to quickly develop economically competitive alternative supply sources.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Market forces alone are unlikely to solve the problem. Targeted government investment will be critical to breaking China’s gallium monopoly and undercutting its geopolitical leverage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responding to this mounting crisis will require the United States to take urgent steps to develop alternative sources of gallium supply and extraction technologies. Fortunately, the financial investments needed are relatively modest and promising solutions are well within reach—but only with a level of sustained policy attention that has only just begun to materialize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;galliums-role-in-chinas-geoeconomic-strategy&quot;&gt;Gallium’s Role in China’s Geoeconomic Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s use of critical mineral export controls is not a new phenomenon, but it has evolved in recent years from a policy bludgeon to a precision tool. A defining early example came in 2011, when Beijing temporarily withheld rare earth exports to Japan amid a territorial dispute over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands. China backed off from those restrictions within months, but not before sending rare earth prices skyrocketing over 80 percent and leaving Japanese officials scrambling for alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2019, China trained this threat against the United States. As trade frictions flared under the first Trump administration, Chinese leader Xi Jinping publicly visited a rare earth processing facility in a conspicuous warning about the potential costs of further escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the ensuing years, China further strengthened its hand by developing a legal and regulatory framework to transform these scattered actions into a comprehensive export control system. In 2020, the Chinese legislature passed the Export Control Law, which gave Beijing streamlined authorities to exercise “control on the export of dual-use items.” Unprecedented in Chinese export control regimes, the law included a provision claiming extraterritorial jurisdiction, meaning even entities outside of China could be held accountable for violating its statutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/QdJALAR.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: China’s Escalating Export Controls Impacting Gallium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2023, China put these tools to the test, announcing new licensing requirements limiting the export of gallium and germanium. The rules were broadly seen as retaliation against a series of landmark export controls put in place between October 2022 and July 2023 by the United States, Japan, and the Netherlands banning the sale of leading-edge chips and semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s initial restrictions were cautious but calculated. Stopping short of an outright ban, they required gallium and germanium exporters to apply for licenses and disclose detailed end-use tracing information about their clients to China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM). Notably, MOFCOM emphasized that these measures did “not target any specific country.” Still, the move sent a powerful signal that if China’s semiconductor industry were denied Western chips and tools, China could deny the West crucial raw materials and intermediate inputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing significantly tightened these restrictions as U.S. technology controls ramped up. In December 2024, the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security announced a package of expanded chip-related controls, including the addition of 140 Chinese semiconductor firms onto its Entity List. Just one day later, MOFCOM issued an update to its own export controls which functionally banned the export of gallium, germanium, antimony, and superhard materials to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The order marked the most stringent export controls China has put in place. For the first time, the ruling asserted the long-arm jurisdiction that China built into its Export Control Law years earlier, declaring that “any organization or individual of any country or region” would be held responsible for violating it. In effect, the rule formally outlawed the re-export or transshipment of gallium and other covered materials to the United States through third countries or territories, closing a major enforcement loophole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less than one month later, Beijing took its gallium export controls even further in a quiet but consequential move. On January 2, 2025, MOFCOM amended its export control catalogue to include several of the key extraction technologies used to separate gallium metal from its host ores (generally bauxite or zinc). The addition indicates that China is now taking steps to preserve its leverage over gallium supply chains by withholding the most cost-efficient means of extracting it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2025, China escalated once again by launching a coordinated interagency push to crack down on the smuggling and transshipment of restricted critical minerals. Coinciding with high-level U.S.-China trade discussions in Geneva, China’s State Export Control Work Coordination Mechanism Office convened over 10 central ministries—including MOFCOM and the Ministry of State Security (MSS)—as well as dozens of local officials to deepen enforcement over strategic mineral exports. China’s MSS has previously publicized its efforts to foil gallium smuggling attempts, but the new mechanism reflects Beijing’s deepened commitment to reinforcing its emerging export control system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creeping expansion of China’s gallium restrictions, from limited licensing requirements and end-user controls to full on embargos and long-arm export bans, offers important clues as to how the ongoing trade war may escalate. Beijing has already shown that it can use the progression of its gallium export controls as a playbook for choking off the United States and its partners from a broader range of strategic minerals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reassessing-the-impacts-of-chinas-gallium-export-controls&quot;&gt;Reassessing the Impacts of China’s Gallium Export Controls&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initial reactions in the United States to China’s gallium export restrictions downplayed the potential for disruption. In the months following China’s first 2023 announcement of its controls, company representatives, policy analysts, and government officials expressed confidence that production lines would remain unaffected and that alternative sources would quickly come online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leading chipmakers and downstream manufacturers reassured reporters and investors that their supplies were diversified, assessing that there would be “no material impact.” Citing international customs and trade data, analysts pointed to the low amount of gallium products imported directly from China to the United States to suggest that dependencies were negligible. Even U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan appeared unconcerned, remarking at a CSIS event in late 2024 that “there are other sources of . . . gallium in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, these optimistic assessments obscured deeper structural vulnerabilities that have grown increasingly acute as China’s gallium controls have tightened. This analysis highlights three key developments which suggest that the risk of China’s gallium restrictions to U.S. and allied supply chains is greater than previously understood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-point-1-diverging-prices-within-and-outside-of-china-reflect-a-growing-supply-crunch&quot;&gt;Key Point 1: Diverging prices within and outside of China reflect a growing supply crunch.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since China’s export controls went into effect in August 2023, the price of gallium has diverged sharply between domestic Chinese and international markets. Within a month of the initial announcement, low-purity gallium prices in the Rotterdam exchange spiked by over 43 percent as Chinese suppliers halted shipments while applying for export licenses from MOFCOM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This surge can be partially explained by a widespread rush by international buyers to stockpile gallium before the controls took effect. However, prices did not come back down even after demand stabilized, reflecting the impact of a supply-side squeeze caused by reduced Chinese exports of gallium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/LsJszeQ.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: Gallium Price Shocks and Supply Shortages&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost of gallium outside of China, represented by its listed price on the Rotterdam exchange, has continued to significantly diverge from domestic price points as Chinese exports have fallen. By early 2024, prices appeared to have largely decoupled into two distinct markets, with gallium sold outside of China at nearly double the price of that within China (see Figure 2). Chinese customs data helps tell the story, showing that the country’s average monthly gallium exports drop significantly after August 2023 (see Figure 3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/qpUp259.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 3: China’s Unwrought Gallium Exports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These trends have intensified following China’s escalation of its controls to a full-scale embargo on the U.S. market beginning in December 2024. Tighter due diligence requirements, imposed by the extraterritoriality clause in the new controls, have further reduced China’s gallium exports and caused prices to surge to record highs. By mid-December, gallium prices jumped to their highest level since 2011 and continued to climb precipitously. In May 2025, the Rotterdam price of gallium reached $687 per kg, an increase of over 150 percent over pre-control prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, gallium prices within China have fallen due a combination of domestic oversupply and a lower demand outlook triggered by a recent shift in China’s photovoltaics industry away from technologies requiring gallium. The fact that this excess supply is not being exported, despite sky-high prices in overseas markets, reflects the seriousness of Beijing’s most recent controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compelling anecdotal evidence provided by firms similarly points to a major supply crunch impacting not only U.S. companies but also major firms in allied countries like Japan and South Korea. Japanese officials and executives have expressed concern over the impacts of China’s newly escalated licensing requirements on gallium exports, equating the rules to “some sort of declaration of economic war against the rest of the world.” South Korean sources have similarly reported to the authors that Korean firms have been forced to wait months for licenses from MOFCOM, with some being denied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These developments confirm analysts’ worst fears about China’s ability and willingness to meaningfully constrain global access to gallium. While the full extent of the impact of these measures on sensitive production lines remains unclear, companies downstream of the gallium supply chain could soon face dire challenges. The case of Henkel, a German producer of industrial adhesives that was recently forced to declare force majeure on its deliveries due to disruptions from China’s restrictions of antimony, stands as a dire warning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-point-2-non-chinese-sources-of-gallium-remain-reliant-on-feedstock-originally-sourced-from-china&quot;&gt;Key Point 2: Non-Chinese sources of gallium remain reliant on feedstock originally sourced from China.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s decision to target gallium was driven by unique market dynamics that provide Beijing with an unusual degree of leverage over the mineral’s global supply. In 2024, China produced 98 percent of the world’s low-purity gallium, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS)—a figure well above its share of production of other targeted minerals such as germanium (68 percent) and antimony (48 percent). As a result of this near total monopoly, China can credibly withhold access to gallium supply from downstream markets, leaving buyers with few short-term alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relatively small quantity of gallium consumed globally each year similarly provides China with acute leverage over markets. Annual demand for gallium is below 700 metric tons (t) internationally, a fraction of the massive markets for minerals like copper (25.9 million t) or nickel (3.1 million t). While demand for gallium is rising quickly, its comparatively small market means that even limited supply variations can have significant impacts on its global availability. This also makes gallium prices highly sensitive to minor supply adjustments, giving Beijing considerable leverage to manipulate market forces by artificially releasing or withholding flows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/OsZqAQU.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 4: Global Gallium Supply Projections&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s stranglehold over gallium supply chains is rooted in its leading position in aluminum production. Gallium is not extracted directly from the earth—instead, it is recovered as a byproduct of processing other materials, primarily bauxite (the mother ore of aluminum), with a small amount also from zinc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As China emerged as the world’s dominant producer of aluminum over the past two decades, it also developed the scale and technical capabilities to mass-produce gallium. Leading state-owned aluminum processors like the Aluminum Corporation of China (Chalco) were encouraged by state authorities to install the equipment needed to extract gallium from aluminum tailings. As China’s production of low-purity gallium began to explode and flood global markets around 2010, severe price fluctuations forced most of the leading non-Chinese suppliers out of the business over the following decade (see Figure 5a and 5b).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Left as virtually the only supplier in the world, China found itself with the means to translate its market dominance over gallium into geopolitical leverage in a way that few in the West saw coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/7C2SJcm.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 5: A. Global Aluminum Production; B. Global Gallium Production&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even firms not directly reliant on low-purity gallium could soon begin to feel the impacts of China’s restrictions. China’s direct dominance over gallium recedes further down the supply chain, diminishing to around 50 percent in the production of refined (high-purity) gallium and even less for intermediate products like gallium compounds and semiconductor wafers. Yet, these downstream inputs remain almost entirely dependent on gallium feedstock originating in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relatively scant publicly available data on gallium flows has contributed to an illusion of supply chain resilience among some U.S. firms and analysts. The United States has never imported a majority of its low-purity gallium from China, creating the appearance of a diversified supply. Even after U.S. imports of Chinese gallium zeroed out following China’s 2023 export controls, the United States was still able to source imports from countries like Japan, Germany, and other partners, suggesting that it could easily route around Chinese controls. For high-purity gallium, the United States even has one domestically based supplier in operation, reducing its reliance on imports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/zEeOeFU.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 6: Gallium Production Cycle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, China’s new export controls should complicate this sense of security. MOFCOM’s licensing system now requires importers of Chinese gallium to provide detailed end-user tracing information, and foreign firms that supply U.S. companies with gallium at any point in the supply chain risk losing access to their only viable source of raw gallium if discovered. This creates strong incentives for foreign firms to halt service to their U.S. customers, as the marginal U.S. market for gallium likely does not justify the risks involved. These dynamics are further heightened by uncertainty over the extent of China’s enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/a8gTHcD.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 7: A. Low-Purity Gallium Exports by Origin Country; B. Estimated High-Purity Gallium Exports by Origin Country&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s expanded controls could also begin to impact the few existing alternatives to Chinese gallium feedstock, which are primarily recycling facilities that recover gallium from scrap generated via the downstream wafer substrate manufacturing process. As an example, Japan uses approximately 40 percent of domestically recovered scrap and 60 percent primary low-purity gallium from China as feedstock into its domestic refining production. Still, the production capacity at its recycling facilities is limited and relatively costly, and ultimately it remains reliant on drawdowns from existing inventories that could gradually shrink as China further withholds upstream supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These challenges are reflected in a detailed 2024 study by the U.S. Geological Survey—published prior to China’s updated export controls—which estimates that a full-scale Chinese embargo of gallium could cause an $8 billion hit to U.S. gross domestic product. The largest projected losses were concentrated in the semiconductor industry, underscoring the vulnerability of strategic U.S. supply chains to China’s controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-point-3-new-export-controls-on-gallium-extraction-technology-further-undercut-the-price-competitiveness-for-non-chinese-producers&quot;&gt;Key Point 3: New export controls on gallium extraction technology further undercut the price competitiveness for non-Chinese producers.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s dominant position over gallium supply chains extends beyond the raw material itself. A more opaque but similarly consequential constraint lies in the specialized resin technology used to extract gallium from bauxite ore processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As previously mentioned, China’s dominance over gallium production is not the result of a monopoly over access to deposits—gallium is fairly abundant—but rather its unmatched ability to extract the metal at scale and at lower cost. Chinese state-backed companies have outpaced global competitors by investing in the energy-intensive, chemically complex, and environmentally taxing process of extracting gallium from the Bayer liquor created during the processing of bauxite ore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most expensive steps in this process is isolating gallium from ore tailings at volumes that make production commercially viable. Chinese firms have innovated new methods of doing this at lowered costs. In particular, the chemical company Sunresin has developed a proprietary chelating resin tailored for gallium recovery. This resin outperforms older methods in both adsorption capacity and operational lifespan, allowing producers to extract more gallium per cycle with less material degradation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of China’s dominant domestic gallium industry, Chinese firms can produce these resins with economies of scale that their overseas competitors cannot match. Chinese facilities can thus produce gallium more cheaply and further extend their dominance, creating a positive feedback loop. This high-performance resin is critical to keeping China’s production costs well below what Western producers can match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge is compounded by the fact that this resin is neither widely manufactured outside of China nor readily substitutable. Sunresin produces as much as 90 percent of the global supply. While other methods of extracting gallium exist, they are more expensive and degrade more quickly, making it difficult for non-Chinese producers to compete with China on price, even under normal market conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the strategic value of this technology, Chinese authorities in 2025 quietly expanded their export controls to include the resin itself. A January update added “technologies for extracting gallium metal from alumina mother liquor using ion-exchange or resin methods” (通过离子交换法、树脂法等方法从氧化铝母液中提取金属镓的技术和工艺) to MOFCOM’s export control list. Industry sources have reported that exports of the high-performance resin have ceased entirely due to these new restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the United States and its allies, this presents a fundamental obstacle to rebuilding domestic gallium supply chains. Even with feedstock and refining infrastructure in place, producers outside of China are unlikely to achieve competitive costs without equivalent resin performance. Until incentives are put in place to support the production of high-performance resin at adequate scale, non-Chinese producers will struggle to compete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;galliums-strategic-significance&quot;&gt;Gallium’s Strategic Significance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gallium is used within a wide range of technologies, from advanced semiconductors to light emitting diodes, laser diodes, and permanent magnets. Yet, gallium’s true importance to the United States is not reflected properly in official reporting. The USGS shows gallium consumption in the United States to be around 20 t per year. However, taking into account imports of gallium-based wafers, magnets, and LEDs, consumption is likely far higher, up to 200 t per year (see Figure 8).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/8CGcivH.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 8: United States Estimated Annual Gallium Consumption&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critically, gallium’s outsized importance to key defense supply chains has elevated its value as a source of strategic leverage for China. China’s decision to open its controls with gallium—rather than other more commercially important minerals—allowed it to signal its capacity to disrupt U.S. and allied defense production while avoiding broader damage to its own economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance of gallium to advanced defense systems is difficult to overstate. Gallium compounds enable a class of “wide bandgap” semiconductors that outperform silicon in extreme operating conditions. Gallium nitride (GaN) transistors, for example, can operate at higher voltages and temperatures with lower losses, making them ideal for advanced radar, electronic warfare systems, and other applications requiring efficient power conversion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. defense systems have incorporated gallium-based technology for decades, but gallium compounds have taken on an increasingly critical role. Recent improvements in GaN chip design and falling fabrication costs have brought about rapid advances in next-generation radar technology. Widespread adoption of GaN chips has enabled smaller radar modules to track targets with higher resolution at farther distances. GaN-backed modules have been integrated into the U.S. military’s most important modern radar systems, including the Navy’s AN/SPY-6 radar, the Marine Corps’ G/ATOR radar, the Army’s LTAMDS radar, the Missile Defense Agency’s AN/TPY-2 radar, and the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter’s upgraded AESA radar, to name just a few.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gallium-enabled radar systems will also play an irreplaceable role in any efforts to build a layered nationwide missile defense shield, like the “Golden Dome” proposed by President Donald Trump. For example, Lockheed’s GaN-based Long Range Discrimination Radar—which is currently undergoing field testing in Alaska and will likely go into service next year—would form a crucial layer in the system’s defense against ballistic missile attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Gallium-enabled radar systems will play an irreplaceable role in any efforts to build a layered nationwide missile defense shield, like the “Golden Dome.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Department of Defense has invested millions of dollars in recent years to develop another emerging compound, called gallium oxide. Gallium oxide has an even wider bandgap and better performance potential than GaN, and it could form the backbone of a new generation of even more powerful and efficient defense electronic systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These and other technical developments have made U.S. and allied defense systems deeply reliant on technologies made with gallium. Open-source assessments reveal that over 11,000 individual parts used across the U.S. Department of Defense require gallium, and nearly 85 percent of defense supply chains containing gallium are known to include at least one Chinese supplier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key U.S. allies and security partners, ranging from Poland to Saudi Arabia to Taiwan, have also placed orders for U.S.-built GaN-enabled radar systems in recent years. As a result, supply vulnerabilities extend beyond the United States to its most important strategic partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;breaking-chinas-monopoly&quot;&gt;Breaking China’s Monopoly&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extent to which China can derive leverage from its monopoly over gallium production fundamentally depends on how fast alternative supply sources can come online. If plants outside of China can rapidly begin or restart gallium extraction, then China’s ability to threaten global supply chains will quickly diminish. While promising initiatives are underway to establish new gallium production capabilities, decisive government action is needed to ensure these efforts are protected from China’s market manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-limits-of-market-forces&quot;&gt;The Limits of Market Forces&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On its face, the gallium problem appears to have a clear market solution. As China restricts global supply, the rising global price of gallium should entice new producers into the market, creating alternatives to Chinese supply. The more China uses its leverage, the less it should have left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the unique market characteristics of gallium discussed in the previous section mean that this challenge is unlikely to be solved by market forces alone. With near-complete control over the floodgates of global supply, Beijing can easily manipulate gallium prices to desired levels. In practice, this means that firms seeking to enter the market cannot guarantee that the market price of gallium will remain high enough to cover production costs. If alternative suppliers appear to be ramping up production, China could suddenly flood the market, cratering prices and erasing profits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gallium’s small market size relative to the huge aluminum market further adds to the challenge. For a Western alumina refinery, adding a gallium side-stream would impart additional complexity and risk for only a tiny fraction of the revenue generated by its alumina production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s exclusive access to the most advanced resins used to extract gallium also gives its domestic refineries a significant cost advantage, further reducing incentives for foreign firms to compete. Absent market conditions that can support the scaled production of gallium extraction resins outside of China, non-Chinese firms will likely remain at a prohibitively large cost disadvantage in primary gallium production compared with their Chinese competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These factors reflect the limits of relying on market forces to respond to China’s export controls. While current market conditions (characterized by rising demand, highly constrained supply, and high prices) have spurred considerable interest from new gallium producers worldwide, a long-term solution will require sustained government action if it is to incentivize firms to enter the market and stay there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;us-domestic-opportunities&quot;&gt;U.S. Domestic Opportunities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given these market limitations, government intervention will be necessary to ensure that short-term, long-term, and emergency requirements for gallium material can be readily met. Some U.S. government agencies have taken initial steps toward finding alternative suppliers, yet more work is needed to move beyond assessments toward concrete action. This includes taking swift action to support promising efforts by private companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Federal investments to expand domestic gallium production have begun to take shape. In 2024, the Department of Energy’s Critical Materials Innovation Hub (CMI Hub) announced up to $10 million in federal funding to accelerate early-stage R&amp;amp;D for critical mineral extraction technologies, including gallium. This funding aims to unlock more efficient methods for gallium byproduct recovery, separation, and concentration—areas where the United States has lagged behind China’s resin-based extraction processes. The Department of Defense (DOD) has similarly begun using its Defense Production Act (DPA) authorities to prioritize awards for gallium recovery projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these are positive first steps toward meeting long-term needs, more action is required to address the immediate and short-term vulnerabilities caused by China’s tightening restrictions. For example, while the DOD maintains a National Defense Stockpile (NDS) of critical materials, this does not include gallium. Even in the wake of China’s export controls, the Defense Logistics Agency—which manages the NDS—left gallium off its materials procurement plan for 2025. While the NDS has limitations, the idea of including a minimum stockpile of gallium is a low-cost insurance policy against the worst-case outcomes of China’s restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More federal support can also accelerate promising efforts that are already underway to find viable domestic supply alternatives. The Idaho National Laboratory is leading the development of integrated separation and processing systems for rare earth–rich ore bodies, such as those at the Sheep Creek deposit in Montana. Notably, recent geological assessments at Sheep Creek suggest the site contains the highest concentrations of gallium found in any known U.S. deposit. Private sector partners such as the U.S. Critical Materials Corporation are actively seeking to scale this discovery into commercial production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another initiative worthy of close attention is MTM Critical Metals’ pre-permitted facility in Texas, which aims to deploy a patent-protected process for extracting gallium from industrial scrap. Scheduled to begin operations in early 2026—an unusually rapid timeline for critical-mineral projects—the plant could provide the first domestic source of gallium recovered largely outside Chinese influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, MTM is reportedly negotiating binding agreements that lock in scrap feedstock and set minimum offtake prices with Indium Corporation, a leading U.S. supplier of purified gallium to semiconductor fabs. These price-floor provisions are expressly designed to shield the venture from Chinese market manipulation, offering a test case for how contractual innovation can complement technical advances in rebuilding resilient supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, industrial retrofit opportunities present low-hanging fruit for production scale-up. For example, Atalco’s Gramercy Refinery in Louisiana—the only operating alumina refinery in the United States—could support side-stream gallium recovery with relatively modest upgrades. Similarly, Nyrstar has touted a $150 million effort to build a gallium and germanium processing facility at its existing zinc plant in Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these encouraging developments, warning signs prove why government backing is essential for long-term success. In October 2023, Nyrstar’s operations at its Clarksville zinc smelter—where it intended to install gallium and germanium recovery equipment—was put on indefinite hold after financing and engineering challenges delayed key milestones. The episode mirrors the fate of Australia’s Pinjarra gallium refinery, which was forced to cease operations in the 1990s when low prices and a lack of policy support erased commercial margins. Both cases illustrate the importance of sustained government incentives, stable offtake contracts, and clear policy signals that strategic minerals production will be rewarded over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;international-collaboration-with-allied-producers&quot;&gt;International Collaboration with Allied Producers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rebuilding gallium supply chains at speed cannot be achieved through domestic sources alone. While establishing a reliable domestic supply is a reasonable strategic objective, it should be secondary to the urgent task of quickly developing large-scale gallium production outside of China. Ultimately, these efforts should prioritize projects that add gallium side-stream capacity at large-scale aluminum refiners, most of which are located outside of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trusted partners in Canada, Australia, Japan, and Europe each bring unique capabilities and reserves that can narrow gaps in U.S. capacity. The recent designation of Australia and the United Kingdom as domestic sources for DPA funds was a critical step in leveraging allied advantages, but more international coordination with like-minded global partners is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canada already hosts North America’s only gallium producer, Neo Performance Materials. Although its operations are currently limited to recycling scrap inputs, it could help bridge the gap as primary production comes online. More significantly, Rio Tinto is exploring gallium recovery from alumina tailings at its Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean refinery in Quebec. If commercial-scale processing proceeds as planned, Rio Tinto could eventually supply 40 t of gallium annually—enough to meaningfully diversify North American supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia represents perhaps the greatest near-term opportunity for large-scale gallium production. Alumina refineries operated by South32 and Alcoa in Western Australia account for the largest such capacity outside of China, and given that gallium is recovered as a byproduct of alumina refining, these operations offer compelling economies of scale. Industry analysis suggests that building side-stream gallium recovery plants at these sites could be cost-effective and yield up to 40 t annually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Separately, Nimy Resources is exploring secure gallium supply chains for U.S. defense applications through a collaboration with M2i Global. The partnership reflects the value of demand-side signaling from the U.S. government to spur up-front investment from private firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan, in partnership with the United States and South Korea, has committed to strengthening critical mineral supply chains, including gallium, under a trilateral framework announced in June 2024. Japan has a long history of utilizing gallium in its advanced electronics industry and is among the largest producers of gallium outside of China. The agreement highlights the shared priority of developing enhanced refining and processing capabilities—critical steps in reducing dependence on Chinese intermediates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe also shows signs of renewed momentum. Greek metals group Metlen plans to extract gallium as part of a €295 million expansion to its alumina production capacity, aiming for 50 t of gallium annually by 2027. This initiative has been designated as a strategic project under the European Union’s Critical Raw Materials Act, ensuring priority access to permits and financing. Meanwhile, Germany’s Stade refinery—once a major gallium producer—has announced plans to restart operations by 2027, potentially adding another 40 t per year to the global supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, whether these new sources of supply will be accessible to U.S. buyers will depend on the evolving global trade landscape. The Trump administration’s tenuous relationship with many traditional trading partners may cause political roadblocks, and European policymakers may seek to channel the material to their own clean-tech and defense sectors first. Proactive U.S.–EU negotiations on long-term offtake agreements will therefore be essential to lock in access before production comes fully online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, Kazakhstan—while not a traditional U.S. ally or security partner—previously produced primary gallium at the Padvolar refinery up until the early 2010s. It has recently suggested that production will recommence, with a target of 15 t per year from the second half of 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-and-policy-recommendations&quot;&gt;Conclusion and Policy Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By doubling down on its gallium and other critical mineral restrictions, China’s leaders appear to have calculated that the country’s dominance over the global supply of minerals upstream of critical high-tech supply chains provides it with meaningful leverage over its rivals. Current trends reflect the worrying possibility that they could be right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, acting quickly to shore up these vulnerabilities is a critical test of U.S. and allied resilience against China’s emerging economic tool kit. Failing to respond effectively will send dangerous signals to Beijing about its ability to inflict asymmetric pain on the United States and allied economies. Fortunately, the United States and its global partners can take straightforward steps to neutralize China’s leverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If even a subset of the above international and domestic projects come online as planned, non-Chinese production capacity could grow by as much as 170 t—approximately 24 percent of current global supply. This would not only be sufficient to meet much of allied demand but could also help rebalance global pricing and undercut the effectiveness of China’s market manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To capitalize on these opportunities, policymakers should:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Invest in a gallium defense stockpile using existing Defense Production Act authorities.&lt;/strong&gt; The Department of Defense should expand its Strategic and Critical Materials Stockpiling Program to include at least 50 t of gallium over a five-year horizon. The stockpile should prioritize sourcing from non-Chinese suppliers under long-term offtake agreements and could be administered through the Defense Logistics Agency. Gallium has a shelf life of just one year, requiring careful inventory management to prevent degradation and ensure a reliable reserve during periods of supply disruption. The recently passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act provides $2 billion for critical minerals stockpiling through the National Defense Stockpile Transaction Fund. A small portion of these funds allocated toward gallium would go far in securing adequate supply for defense needs. Congress should also require an annual assessment of gallium supply adequacy under the National Defense Authorization Act to institutionalize visibility and planning.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expand federal matching funds for gallium and germanium recovery pilots at existing zinc and alumina refineries.&lt;/strong&gt; The Department of Energy’s Office of Industrial Efficiency and the Department of Commerce should jointly create a pilot-scale retrofit fund—modeled on the 48C Advanced Energy Project Credit—specifically targeted at adding gallium recovery capabilities at existing facilities like South32’s Worsley Alumina in Western Australia and Nyrstar’s Clarksville Smelter. Matching should prioritize first-mover projects in facilities that coproduce high-purity alumina or zinc, where side-stream economics are most viable. These agreements should also be supported with floor-price and guaranteed offtake arrangements backed by stockpiling mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a joint procurement mechanism with allies to de-risk early production volumes and stabilize demand signals.&lt;/strong&gt; The United States should work with Japan, the European Union, and Canada to establish a pooled purchasing program—similar to NATO’s Strategic Airlift Capability—to jointly contract initial volumes of gallium from new projects. This could take the form of forward offtake agreements with price floors indexed to Chinese domestic gallium benchmarks, insulating new producers from deliberate undercutting by Beijing. Procurement agencies such as the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency, Japan’s JOGMEC, and the European Union’s EIT Raw Materials could coadminister this initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthen multilateral coordination through the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP) to ensure cross-border investment, data sharing, and streamlined permitting for critical mineral projects.&lt;/strong&gt; MSP members should create a shared project tracking database for gallium-relevant extraction, refining, purification, and recycling initiatives, including harmonized data on projected output, permitting status, and investor needs. Additionally, the United States should propose the creation of a “fast track” gallium permitting lane for projects in allied jurisdictions, modeled on the Five Eyes’ clean energy infrastructure cooperation frameworks. The MSP could also coordinate diplomatic engagement with European nations where gallium projects are underway, such as Greece and Germany, to ensure U.S. access to gallium produced under EU strategic materials programs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;鄒家成余慧明投訴作供期間遭原審法官多番介入&quot;&gt;鄒家成余慧明投訴作供期間遭原審法官多番介入&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ihYkqz1.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2020年初選47人涉嫌串謀顛覆國家政權，其中31名被告認罪，不認罪16人當中有14人經審訊後被裁定罪成，李予信及劉偉聰2人罪脫。11人不服定罪及刑期上訴，認罪的黃子悅提刑期上訴。案件今（16日）在西九龍法院（暫代高院上訴庭）繼續上訴聆訊。上訴方指，沒有證據證明民主黨所有成員行事統一，法庭沒有基礎裁定黃碧雲和林卓廷必然同意「無差別」否決財案，不排除民主黨對否決財案沒有統一立場。鄒家成一方則投訴，原審法官在他作供主問期間多次介入，而且整個作供過程中，法官的發問數目佔所有問題的45%，導致鄒未能得到公平審訊。余慧明亦同樣投訴原審法官多番介入主問，包括不批准余的代表大律師就某些問題發問，以及接管整個主問，導致辯方呈現案情時受到阻礙。余慧明一方更指，法官陳慶偉不批准辯方大律師繼續追問，並以「next question, thank you」作結，是一種帶有嘲諷或貶損意味的回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件由高院首席法官潘兆初、上訴庭法官彭偉昌及彭寶琴審理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;經審訊後被裁定罪成並提出上訴的11名被告包括：何啟明、陳志全、鄒家成、吳政亨、何桂藍、鄭達鴻、余慧明、黃碧雲、林卓廷、楊雪盈和梁國雄。認罪囚4年5個月的黃子悅，則提出刑期上訴。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;律政司代表包括：副刑事檢控專員周天行、高級助理刑事檢控專員劉德偉、助理刑事檢控專員羅天瑋、高級檢控官吳加悅、徐倩姿和莊文欣等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;上訴方鄺俊宇和涂謹申同屬民主黨參與初選卻未被起訴&quot;&gt;上訴方：鄺俊宇和涂謹申同屬民主黨、參與初選卻未被起訴&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表黃碧雲和林卓廷的大律師沈士文繼續陳詞。他指，沒有任何證據顯示黃和林直接與戴耀廷溝通，也沒有直接證據顯示二人對「35+」以外、戴的涉案計劃知情，或者閱讀過戴的文章。即使二人純粹知悉戴的「攬炒」主張、吳政亨「三投三不投」和「墨落無悔」聲明，也不會等同於二人同意犯罪協議，即「無差別」否決財案。沈強調，參與初選本身並不足以證明二人同意犯罪協議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈提及同樣來自民主黨、但未被起訴的初選參與者，包括鄺俊宇和涂謹申，亦提及有兩人經審訊被裁定罪名不成立，可見法庭必須有足夠證據肯定被告同意「無差別」否決財案，迫使特首下台，才能定罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈指，黃和林沒有簽署「墨落無悔」聲明，二人對於「無差別」否決財案並不感興趣，也沒有出席過初選協調會議。因此法庭手上便沒有任何證據，因為二人從沒就「無差別」否決財案發表過任何言論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;上訴方不排除民主黨對否決財案沒有統一立場&quot;&gt;上訴方：不排除民主黨對否決財案沒有統一立場&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈又指，沒有證據證明民主黨所有成員行事統一，「這是一個神話」，需要有證據支持。然而兩名控方證人、前民主黨成員區諾軒和趙家賢，作供時未有提及民主黨的內部運作，例如黨員是否行動一致。警方到被告住所搜屋時，也未有檢取到任何文件或會議紀錄，能夠證明到民主黨對於否決財案的議題持統一的立場。再者，法庭並不能知道民主黨立場的鬆散或統一程度，其中一個可能的推論是，民主黨對於否決財案並沒有一個統一的立場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈指，原審法官在裁決中引述時任民主黨主席胡志偉在初選論壇上的發言，「今日喺香港，我相信我哋在座嘅每一個候選人其實都係好清楚，反對國安法⋯⋯我哋參與呢個初選自必然亦都一定會係會運用我哋嘅喺議會上面嘅否決權，財政預算案嘅否決權，去迫使到特區政府同中央政府必須要回應五大訴求⋯⋯」，並推論「我相信我哋在座嘅每一個候選人」包括黃和林，從而裁定必然會否決財案。然而，沈指「我相信我哋在座嘅每一個候選人」僅意指出席當日九龍東區初選論壇的候選人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈指，法庭單憑胡志偉的發言，不能作出唯一合理推論指所有民主黨成員均支持否決財案，這是錯誤的。若然民主黨沒有任何統一的立場，又若然當中有任何疑點，法庭便沒有足夠的證據去將黃碧雲和林卓廷定罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;上訴方林有其個人觀點-不支持無差別否決財案&quot;&gt;上訴方：林有其個人觀點 不支持「無差別」否決財案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈引述九龍西選舉論壇的發言，當另一名參選人劉澤鋒質問黃碧雲：「民主黨係咪應承一齊攬炒先？」黃碧雲回應：「我哋係會用盡憲制裡面所有嘅權力同埋手段係爭取五大訴求，如果否決財政預算案能夠促成呢一樣嘢，我哋一定會做。」沈指上述顯示黃只會運用《基本法》框架內的權力，而否認支持「攬炒」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈另引述林卓廷的論壇發言，談及否決財案時，林稱「我哋要睇具體嘅議案，具體嘅政策」，又表明若果政府在財政預算案中包含「派錢」的話，便不會投反對票。沈指，上述言論顯示林否認他會「無差別」否決財案，亦證明了民主黨成員之間並沒有統一的立場，否則林便會被黨排斥（an outcast）。沈又重申，雖然論壇筆記提及他附和胡志偉否決財案的主意，但是一旦談及有關議題的時候，林卓廷並沒有按照論壇筆記發言、偏離了標準答案，可見林有其個人觀點，而且他不支持「無差別」否決財案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈又質疑，原審法官未有考慮上述證據，定罪是不合邏輯，然而對於另一名被告劉偉聰不跟從論壇筆記發言的說法卻接納。沈指，關於林是否同意否決財案方面，至少存在疑點，並強調上述提及的證據均顯示黃和林沒有顛覆政權的意圖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/2t4oV5r.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
▲ 何桂藍（較早前庭上肖象）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何桂藍若正確解讀證供-必不會無差別地否決-反稱會認真審視財案&quot;&gt;何桂藍：若正確解讀證供 必不會「無差別地」否決 反稱會認真審視財案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 指，沒有證據顯示何在案發期間知悉涉案謀劃是不合法，直至法庭裁定該涉案謀劃是不合法，根據法律原則不應裁定被告有罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 又指，原審法官錯誤地拒絕接納何的證供，重申何認為「35+」不可能達成，她參選只為了鼓勵人們出來投票以得到最大票數，引起國際社會的關注。何亦在作供時提及，政府財政預算案存在「公共財政黑洞」、「魔鬼在細節中」，若她當選議員的話會用盡所有機會向政府提問，Beel 指這顯示她會認真審視財案，必定不會「無差別地」否決。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 又引述何供稱，不論「35+」或「35-」也好，如果政府的議案未有被認真審視、政府迴避議員監察或審核程序有不公，她都一定會投反對票，顯示她著眼公帑是否運用得當。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 指，原審法官錯誤地解讀何桂藍的證供，若然正確地解讀的話，便會知道何希望立法會成為一個有效的議會，能夠恰當地行使職能，以向政府問責。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 又指，原審法官錯誤地推論被告有意圖顛覆政權。控方指稱被告透過「無差別」否決財案，意圖引致政府癱瘓，觸發憲政危機，惟Beel 反駁指，「憲政危機」的意思是一些不能解決到的危機或衝突，然而《基本法》第50至53條訂明的機制，能夠處理財案被否決之後的情況，因此並不會引發憲政危機。原審法官在裁決中指稱財案被否決後會引致嚴重後果，只屬揣測。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/l1dmpYw.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
▲ 鄒家成（較早前庭上肖象）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒家成墨落無悔正好反映參選者對於無差別否決不存在共識&quot;&gt;鄒家成：「墨落無悔」正好反映參選者對於「無差別否決」不存在共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表鄒家成的大律師關文渭指，鄒不相信能夠達到「35+」，甚至認為連「Plan B」也會被DQ，若是如此，涉案串謀的基礎便不存在，惟原審法官未有接納鄒的證供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關續指，原審法官錯誤地裁定鄒是參與涉案謀劃的一份子。鄒供稱他未曾收妥初選協調會議文件，惟這說法不被法庭接納，即使他有收過有關文件，也不代表他同意文件內容。單憑鄒收妥協調會議文件，並不足以證明鄒同意涉案謀劃，或使法庭作出唯一不可抗拒推論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於鄒連同另外兩人發起「墨落無悔」聯署，關指因為初選參與者之間就「是否否決財案」沒有共識，所以像鄒這般的「政治素人」便以「墨落無悔」作為一種手段，去迫使民主黨和公民黨等傳統泛民去達致共識。「墨落無悔」正好反映參選者之間對於「無差別否決」方面並不存在共識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關又投訴，原審法官基於鄒的政見是親本土派，便推斷他會「無差別」否決財案，以迫使政府回應訴求，可是鄒的政見頂多只能是一種證明傾向性的證據，如果法庭以此來推論他參與一個嚴重的串謀計劃，未免過於危險。關強調，持有親本土派立場本身不是一種罪名，但是若然法庭利用政見來推論被告有罪，便會非常危險。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒家成作供時原審官多次介入提問-質疑未能獲得公平審訊&quot;&gt;鄒家成：作供時原審官多次介入提問 質疑未能獲得公平審訊&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關文渭亦投訴，原審法官在鄒作供主問期間多次介入，使他未能得到公平審訊。關引述法庭謄本並舉例指，當鄒在證人台上供稱他認為「35+」不可能時，法官李運騰隨即提問，鄒家成遂解釋他的說法，然後法官陳慶偉說：「那沒有邏輯的」，其後庭上開展一輪討論；關質疑情況猶如一名陪審員公開地在庭上評論證人的供詞沒有邏輯，若然審訊設有陪審團的話，便猶如某一名陪審員向另一名陪審員說被告的證供沒有邏輯，有機會引致不公。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關並提及另一個例子，在主問期間，當辯方問到成立獨立調查委員會的訴求，會如何反映在預算案，惟法官陳慶偉主動提到他本人曾主持「鉛水事件」的獨立調查委員會，而該調查委員會從來沒有反映在預算案。關認為，陳官當時做法等同在法官席上給予證供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關又舉例指，鄒家成在作供時，把對「35+」計劃積極的人分成三類，其中一類是「販賣假希望嘅政棍」，但其後自稱是「第四類人」；法官陳慶偉要求鄒再想清楚共有多少類人，「因為我不想你現在捏造（make up）證據」，鄒反問：「咁我而家，要點？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關指，在鄒作供首日，當時代表鄒的大律師陳世傑一共發問了112條問題，然而三名法官卻一共發問了153條問題。縱觀鄒的整個作供過程，法官的發問數目佔所有問題的45%。關指，可能在法官眼中，鄒屬激進派及親本土派，並不值得讚揚，但是他仍然有權獲得公平審訊；相反陳官甚至籲他想清楚才回答，又稱不想鄒捏造證供，這對鄒造成威嚇，使他未有機會解釋其證供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關強調，不只《基本法》和《香港人權法案》，甚至是《國安法》第42條也表明被告有權獲得公平審訊。關指，公平審訊權利是根本性和不可退讓的，不論控方證據有多麼壓倒性也好，被告都有權得到公平審訊，可是鄒卻未能得到公平審訊。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 余慧明（較早前庭上肖象）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余慧明法官打斷大狀提問接管主問-乃逾越界線&quot;&gt;余慧明：法官打斷大狀提問、接管主問 乃逾越界線&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表余慧明的資深大律師彭耀鴻，同樣投訴原審法官多番介入余的主問，包括不批准余的代表大律師石書銘就某些問題發問，以及接管整個主問，導致余的代表大律師未能呈現其辯方案情，尤其是法官不批准他問余的談判底線是什麼，指稱問題與案無關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭指，在余作供的早期階段，原審法官便開始介入提問，其後以辯方大律師的提問不相關為由，持續介入，做法逾越了界線。彭又指，曾有至少一名法官認為辯方大律師的提問與案有關，可是仍被法官陳慶偉打斷，不批准辯方大律師繼續追問，並以「next question, thank you」作結。任何人聽到有關對話或是閱讀錄音謄本，都會意識到陳官口中的「thank you」並不是出於禮貌的回應，而是一種帶有嘲諷或貶損意味的回應。彭指，明白法官工作十分困難，但是余也面對一項可以判處她終身監禁的控罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭又指，法官不斷向余慧明問假設性問題，例如問余，若政府拒絕與他們談判，余會否對預算案投反對票。原審法官最終不接納余的證供，又引述她的公開發言和訪問內容，不相信她會與政府談判及作出讓步，裁定她有顛覆國家政權的意圖並會否決財案，惟彭認為余在作供期間未有機會回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;律政司原審法官提問屬中性-不存在不公或偏見&quot;&gt;律政司：原審法官提問屬中性 不存在不公或偏見&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;律政司代表、高級助理刑事檢控專員劉德偉回應上訴方的陳詞。他指上訴法庭審理上訴申請時，並非要覆核所有證據，除非原審法官的裁斷明顯錯誤，否則上訴庭不應干預原審法官的事實裁斷。劉另指，法庭不應將某些證據抽出來獨立考慮，而是應該考慮多項證據的「累積效應」，以作出唯一不可抗拒的推論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對於鄒家成投訴法官介入提問引致審訊不公，劉德偉反駁指，本案審訊沒有陪審團，乃由三名法官組成的審判庭審理，因此法官不但要就法律議題作出裁斷，同時需兼任「事實裁斷者」角色，為了滿足這個角色的工作，他們有需要在庭上發問，以及向被告澄清其證供。此外，出於案件管理的需要，他們亦要控制及管理大律師的提問，以確保提問乃與本案議題有關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉堅稱，原審法官的提問屬中性，不構成介入，也不會威嚇到鄒，鄒完全有權回答問題；即使辯方大律師某些問題被打斷，但仍然無礙他展示辯方案情。整個作供過程不存在不公或偏見，鄒未有被剝奪公平審訊的權利。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉又指，三名原審法官均是具豐富經驗的法官，他們在裁決理由書將定罪的理由列出，因此沒有任何基礎指稱原審法官不公平。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;律政司胡志偉曾言會運用否決權-證民主黨成員之間立場統一&quot;&gt;律政司：胡志偉曾言會運用否決權 證民主黨成員之間立場統一&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對於大律師沈士文指，民主黨對於否決財案未有統一立場，黃碧雲和林卓廷並不主張「無差別」否決財案。劉德偉則引述時任民主黨主席胡志偉在初選論壇中，曾表明同意運用憲法賦予的否決權，否決財政預算案，顯示民主黨成員之間存在統一的立場。劉指原審法官已正確地考慮有關證據，因胡志偉是時任民主黨主席，其言論表明會運用否決權，因此民主黨的初選參與者，包括黃碧雲、林卓廷、尹兆堅等均抱持統一的取態，而且他們之間必然曾作出相關討論。劉強調，胡志偉和尹兆堅曾分別在公開場合表示會否決財案，這並非純綷巧合，而是有強大的環境證據去證明。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對於林卓廷聲稱沒有按照論壇筆記內容去發言，因此法庭不應考慮論壇筆記內容，劉德偉則反駁指，法庭應該予以考慮。劉指，黃和林提交初選提名表格，加上二人與民主黨的聯繫，能夠支持法庭裁定二人必然會運用否決權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表楊雪盈的大律師張耀良昨日指，原審法官考慮了不相關的證據，包括警方在楊的辦公室電腦搜獲的一份草擬文件，當中提及她「一定會否決」預算案，惟該文件從沒有公開發布、沒有證據顯示楊在選舉工程中使用過它。劉德偉則反駁指，原審法官之所以裁定楊罪成，不單只基於該文件提及她「一定會否決」預算案，還有因為楊認為政府不可信，加上楊曾出席戴耀廷主持的記者會，所以原審法官才有足夠基礎作出不可抗拒的推論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表鄒家成的大律師關文渭回應律政司一方陳詞時，強調法官的提問佔總問題數目的45%，不公是明顯的，因原審法官兼任陪審員角色，卻在庭上告訴被告他是錯誤的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關引述律政司的陳詞指，鄒及其法律代表未有在庭上作出投訴，關則反駁指這說法是不相關，並反問：「大律師怎樣向法官作出投訴，說『你說得太多了』？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;吳政亨質疑量刑比其他承諾否決之參與者多出6個月&quot;&gt;吳政亨質疑量刑比其他承諾否決之參與者多出6個月&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;各上訴人已完成定罪上訴範疇的陳詞，法庭接著聽取有關刑罰上訴的陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表吳政亨的大律師梁麗幗指，不爭議原審法官將被告歸類為不同的判刑類別，但是質疑吳政亨的量刑比其他承諾會否決財案的參選者高出6個月，以致最後判囚7年6個月，是不合理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;梁指，吳從沒主張否決財案，原審法官量刑時未有比較吳與其他初選參與者之間的分別，也未有解釋到為何吳值得比其他承諾會投否決票的人判多6個月。原審法官亦從未得出結論指吳的罪責相比其他參與者較重。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;梁續指，吳並非一名有公眾影響力的人，他發起的「三投三不投」運動亦未造成重大影響力。吳從未走入鎂光燈之下，也從未有任何參選人在初選論壇中提及吳的名字。訊息紀錄顯示，雖然吳曾多次向戴耀廷獻計，但是有關提議從不涉及否決財案或犯罪謀劃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;梁續指，吳對涉案謀劃遠遠說不上是熱衷，他所熱衷的只是爭取「35+」，而從來不是否決財案或是「攬炒」。吳從沒有公開地或私下向任何人施壓，要求對方堅持否決財案，他亦沒有這樣的能力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對於律政司一方指稱吳協助初選的流程和眾籌，可是這些僅屬次要的行動（peripheral actions），不能視之為吳協助推動否決財案的謀劃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;梁又指，吳政亨並非參選者，因此他不會是「作出致命一擊（strike a fatal blow）」的人，即是他不會是最終能夠在立法會投票否決財案，然後觸發憲制危機的人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審，其他上訴人的代表大律師將會就刑罰上訴陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Trump’s most recent threat – to slap Russia’s economic trade partners with prohibitive tariffs in a bid to push through war negotiations with Ukraine – has returned to the fore discussions about the durability of Russia’s economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month’s annual St Petersburg Economic Forum (SPIEF) epitomised some of the fractures in Russia’s elite over the financial trajectory of the country. SPIEF is designed to showcase the very best of Russia’s investment potential – if in previous years this had been a platform for foreign investors to identify new opportunities, this year it seemed to point to a disconnect between President Putin and his ministers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But other problems tangential to the war – which were not discussed at SPIEF – centre around Russia’s ability to support and stimulate those territories of Ukraine that it has seized, to avoid them becoming a further and long-term drain on its resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;economic-woes&quot;&gt;Economic Woes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the usual speculation about which Western countries would attend or shun the highly politicised proceeds, the distinction between Putin’s assessment of the economy, and the rather more muted discussion from his officials was particularly stark this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CEO of state-controlled Sberbank and long-time Putin ally German Greff focused on the business and investment side, warning that high interest rates and an overvalued Ruble were impacting on investment and stymieing Russia’s economic growth, describing the economy as a “perfect storm”, with some Russian business struggling with non-payments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But by far the most dire predictions were those of Minister for Economic Development Maxim Reshetnikov, who maintained that Russia is on the brink of recession, a headline picked up by numerous Russian media outlets and which overshadowed many of the other debates at SPIEF this year. Reshetnikov’s reasoning appeared to be linked to Russia’s GDP growth – for the first quarter of 2025 it has been significantly lower than the same period in 2024, and the downturn has sparked consternation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This decline is largely because Russia’s previous GDP expansions since 2022 were driven by Kremlin-mandated wartime spending, giving a false impression of growth – this was not due to stimulation by investment or a particularly thriving business climate. The illusion of growth, stimulated by high defence spending, likely conceals more structural problems. For now, Russia’s growth predictions for 2025 sit somewhere between 1.5% (according to VTB, Russia’s second largest bank) and 2.5% (Reshetnikov’s own office), with the Central Bank predicting 1-2%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;officials-vs-putin&quot;&gt;Officials Vs Putin?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reshetnikov’s gloomy outlook is not a new narrative – he has consistently pointed to labour shortages in Russia as one of the greatest internal risks for Russia, something that Putin has himself acknowledged, although the gap between acknowledgement and activity towards this remains unbridged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Publicly, the Kremlin has proudly touted the unemployment rate as at an historic low, ignoring the obvious reality that this is because all available manpower is being utilised in service of the war, or emigration to dodge the draft. This also overlooks serious and well-publicised staff shortages in technical enterprises such as Russian Railways – many of their engineers and locomotive crews have either been mobilised or left the country to avoid the draft, resulting in a shortfall of almost 5,000 personnel required to run its extensive transport network. This naturally has an impact on Russia’s ability to boost its trade with allies such as China and Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Head of the Central Bank Elvira Nabiullina has been realistic about Russia’s economic progress and its limitations, maintaining since the start of the war that Russia should brace itself for additional sanctions. In post since 2013, she has worked since Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the subsequent imposition of sanctions to shift the country away from dependence on western financial structures and currencies, moving Russia’s reserves into Chinese currency or Euro – around USD200bn of the Central Bank’s assets are already in gold and renminbi. This has made the Russian economy more resilient to sanctions that reduce Russia’s access to dollars. Russia’s establishment of alternative pay structures to the SWIFT banking system, or the use of Chinese payment systems, while still in their infancy and not approaching the size of SWIFT, are for now reasonably effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But despite a broad consensus about economic challenges between ministers, this was in stark contrast to Putin’s own assessment at SPIEF. Indeed, Putin focused on Russia’s GDP growth, suggested that defence manufacturing was not the only driver of progress, and that industries such as agriculture and construction were one of the top performing sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This disparity of views has been seized upon as evidence of disunity between Putin and his federal officials. But while Putin may not have been prepared to discuss Russia’s economic woes at SPIEF – which is after all supposed to be a platform to showcase the country to foreign investors – he is undoubtedly aware of some of the realities of maintaining high defence spending. In December 2024 in a meeting with the Board of the Ministry of Defence, he noted that while 7.2% of Russia’s GDP is to be spent on its military and defence, he also recognised that this cannot be endlessly increased without consequence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;drains-on-russias-resources&quot;&gt;Drains on Russia’s Resources&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are other pulls on the Russian economy beyond sanctions and military spending on hardware, which were not expressly discussed at SPIEF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Russia makes incremental territorial gains in Ukraine, to consolidate its hold over the territory it has already taken, it must invest and stimulate the local economy, if it is to be anything other than a drain on resources. While there is undoubtedly a political angle in cementing control over these regions and constructing infrastructure, practically speaking, Russia must also account for the social welfare of those living there, including funding pensions and benefits – a significant financial burden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has set up two state programmes to account for funding Crimea and the four occupied territories of Ukraine. In 2025 alone, more than RUB 108 million was allocated for Crimea, and RUB 319 million for the Ukrainian territories, figures that are set to continue more or less unchanged until 2027. The Kremlin’s tactic earlier in the war of splitting up the budgets of wealthier regions such as St Petersburg to fund “reconstruction” projects in occupied regions of Ukraine was unpopular, resulting in less funds available for the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin has attempted to stimulate local investment in the territories through a variety of tax reduction schemes and offering support to SMEs, but these are unlikely to bear economic fruit in the short term. Russia’s patronage of the occupied regions – both economically and through its horizontal political ties – is planned to last at least until 2030, until these regions are able to operate without Moscow’s core financial support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These regions are not the only drain on resources – the Kremlin has had to boost its regional spending in places like the southern Kursk region, where in 2024 the Ukrainian military for months managed to seize several Russian border towns. This was only resolved in April 2025 – over the past few months the Kremlin has had to shore up civilian defences and support displaced residents, to a cost of around RUB 43.9 billion from the Reserve Fund, allocated to Kursk on an ad hoc basis. The costs of reconstruction in Kursk alone (not including neighbouring Belgorod which has experienced similar shelling), runs to an estimated RUB 700 billion – a figure unlikely to be readily available, leaving the region likely impoverished for several years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this suggests that military spending and sanctions aside, Russia in the long term may have greater financial problems on its hands, as it attempts to push more deeply into Ukrainian territory.&lt;/p&gt;

It considers the upstream and downstream processing steps from raw materials, such as coal, that could potentially give North Korea access to those precursor chemicals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the raw materials and precursor chemicals required to support a chemical weapons (CW) programme is an important foundation stone in an assessment of whether North Korea’s chemical industry possesses adequate infrastructure and capability to support such a programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the primary purpose of this report is to serve as a point of reference to identify relevant chemicals for the Project Anthracite team, it will also serve as a useful reference for those engaged in similar work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis in this report is insufficient to determine whether North Korea is engaged in the production of chemical warfare agents (CWAs), but it does identify the chemical processes that would be required to sustain a CW programme. The availability of raw materials, coupled with the availability of basic technology, strongly supports the premise that North Korea can produce simple agents, such as sulfur mustard. There is, however, a greater degree of technical capability needed to produce nerve agents, and this capability may not be immediately obvious in North Korea’s chemical industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report is unique in that it considers the whole range of chemical processes and raw materials required to produce CWAs and does not assume the availability of chemical precursors. Instead, it traces the CWAs, which are relatively complex molecules, back to their roots in raw materials and minerals such as coal and apatite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea has long presented a uniquely challenging environment for intelligence collection – as data is often obscured by limited access and high levels of operational security – and it is often referred to as a “hard target” due to its extreme secrecy and control of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the international community’s intelligence focus has historically centred on North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme, owing to its strategic threat and geopolitical implications. However, there are also concerns around North Korea’s potential chemical weapons (CW) capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rapid evolution and growing sophistication of open source intelligence (OSINT) have transformed the landscape of intelligence analysis. OSINT now allows analysts to synthesise data and to compile, corroborate and assess information from multiple unclassified sources, potentially offering valuable insights into otherwise opaque targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This raises an important question: can OSINT provide meaningful insights into North Korea’s CW capability? While the regime’s access to small quantities of chemical agents is well-documented – most notably in the assassination of Kim Jong Nam in Kuala Lumpur using the nerve agent VX – there are longstanding, although unverified, reports that North Korea may possess between 2,500 and 5,000 tonnes of historic chemical weapons (CW) stockpiles, and the US Defense Intelligence Agency believed in 1997 that North Korea had a “sophisticated chemical weapons programme”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of this paper is to establish a foundational understanding of the chemical infrastructure and materials North Korea would require to operationalise a large-scale CW programme. By identifying the key industrial processes and precursor chemicals necessary, the paper intends to provide a baseline for assessing feasibility and future indicators of potential proliferation activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future papers in this series will build on this framework to further analyse production pathways, dual-use facilities and potential international procurement networks supporting North Korea’s CW ambitions by corroborating publicly available information with sophisticated imagery analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research for this paper employed a multidisciplinary OSINT methodology to assess North Korea’s potential for CW production by reviewing information from a wide range of sources, including North Korean patent applications, state television broadcasts, scientific literature, technical reporting and academic texts. Analysis focused on finding industrial processes and raw materials – such as coal, phosphate rock and arsenic-bearing minerals – relevant to the synthesis of key CWA precursors such as thiodiglycol, phosphorus trichloride and methylphosphonic difluoride. Patents and scientific publications were examined for reported industrial routes and chemical feasibility, while state media provided insights into industrial priorities, capabilities and self-reliance narratives aligned with Juche ideology. Mainstream scientific and grey literature supported validation and cross-referencing of industrial routes and processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A structured framework was used to map upstream and downstream chemical processes against North Korea’s resource base and industrial outputs. Limitations included restricted access to verifiable in-country data and the potential for bias in North Korean state sources, mitigated where possible by multisource corroboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most organic chemicals begin their life cycle as fossil fuel feedstocks, which undergo a series of refining and processing steps in chemical plants to produce basic building block chemicals, often referred to as “upstream” processing. These fundamental chemicals subsequently undergo a series of processing and synthesis steps (“downstream” processing) to produce intermediate and speciality chemicals, which find use in industries ranging from pharmaceutical to agrochemical. Such transformation of raw materials forms the backbone of any chemical industry, and understanding these production pathways is essential to assessing a country’s capacity to access the chemicals that could support a CW programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;basic-raw-materials&quot;&gt;Basic Raw Materials&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coal is abundant in North Korea and plays a significant role in its domestic energy and industrial base. Unlike petroleum-rich nations, North Korea relies heavily on coal as a feedstock for a variety of industrial processes. This makes coal not only a source of energy but also a vital input for chemical manufacturing. The upstream and downstream processing of coal involves several stages that yield a wide range of chemical products. In the context of North Korea, where access to global chemical markets is severely restricted, the ability to extract and refine chemical precursors from coal and minerals represents a potentially important contribution to the North Korean principle of self-sufficiency, Juche.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;upstream-processing&quot;&gt;Upstream Processing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first stages of the chemical production chain in North Korea, coal is converted into fundamental feedstocks. One of the most important conversions is gasification, a process in which coal reacts with oxygen and steam at high temperatures to produce synthesis gas, or “syngas”, composed mainly of hydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syngas serves as a key intermediate in the production of various chemicals, such as methanol, ammonia and urea. Methanol, for instance, can be further processed into methylamines – a group of chemicals which include dual-use chemicals with potential application in the synthesis of nerve agents. Ammonia, another major product of syngas, is used not only in fertiliser production but also as a precursor for nitrating agents and explosives. Thus, even the initial phase of coal chemical processing produces compounds that could serve as important building blocks for a CW programme, depending on the infrastructure and intent of the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;downstream-processing&quot;&gt;Downstream Processing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Downstream processing expands the range of chemical products significantly. Through processes such as Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, coal-derived syngas can be converted into a variety of hydrocarbons, alcohols and other organic chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The breadth of chemical building blocks that can be obtained from fossil fuel feedstocks in shown in the Sankey diagram in Figure 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;processing-of-minerals-and-brine&quot;&gt;Processing of Minerals and Brine&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although organic chemicals begin their lifecycle as fossil fuel feedstocks, most inorganic chemicals begin their life as ores and minerals. North Korea has reserves of more than 200 mineral types, many of which are important sources of inorganic precursors required to produce chemical warfare agents (CWAs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The production of chlorine and sodium hydroxide by the electrolysis of brine is commonly referred to as the “chlor-alkali process”. In 2022, around 100-million tonnes of chlorine were produced worldwide using this process. Chlorine is a key raw material in the production of CWAs as a chlorinating agent in the production of vesicants and important precursors for nerve agents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phosphorites (Apatite)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apatite is the primary mineral in which phosphates are found. It is mined around the world to produce phosphate-based fertiliser. Apatite deposits are common in North Korea and there are many apatite mines. Apatite can be easily converted to white phosphorus by heating in a furnace; the phosphorus can subsequently be converted to phosphorus trichloride by reacting with chlorine. Phosphorus trichloride is a key precursor in the chemistry of CWAs, not only as an important building block for organophosphorus chemicals, but also as a chlorinating agent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the preparation of phosphate-based fertilisers from apatite and fluorapatite, hexafluorosilicic acid is produced as a by-product. Neutralisation of hexafluorosilicic with sodium hydroxide gives sodium fluoride. Apatite (including fluorapatite) deposits are common on the Korean Peninsula, and there are several apatite mines in North Korea, notably the Sonam Mine in Cholsan County.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mirabilite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mirabilite is a hydrous sodium mineral which is often found in parts of the Korean Peninsula. Mirabilite can be used in the production of sodium sulfide by the carbothermic reduction of sodium sulfate. Sodium sulfide is an important precursor in the synthesis of sulfur mustard, and while not included in the CWC’s Annex on Chemicals, is on the AG’s list of controlled precursors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arsenopyrite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arsenic is a critical element for lewisite production, and can be found in deposits of arsenopyrite (FeAsS), a sulfide mineral containing arsenic, iron and sulfur. There are many deposits on the Korean Peninsula, and it is mined at the Sangnong mine in North Korea. The key precursor for lewisite is arsenic trichloride, which can be easily produced by the treatment of arsenic trioxide with hydrogen chloride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arsenic trioxide is released when the mineral arsenopyrite is heated, and incidentally is used to treat acute promyelocytic leukaemia and as such is included on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the most important industrial processes to produce the feedstock chemicals needed for the main CWAs are summarised in Figure 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;production-routes-of-chemical-warfare-agents&quot;&gt;Production Routes of Chemical Warfare Agents&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sulfur-mustard-hd&quot;&gt;Sulfur Mustard (HD)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sulfur mustard is a CWA that was first used in the First World War, and has most recently been used by the Islamic State in Syria. Classed as a vesicant (blister agent), it causes both severe chemical burns on contact with skin, eyes and respiratory tissues and significant chronic health issues, including a predisposition to cancer. Chemically, sulfur mustard or bis(2-chloroethyl)sulfide is a chlorinated organosulfur compound with the formula (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S. Figure 3 shows its most common routes of production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/kckWxXs.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3: The Most Common Production Routes for Sulfur Mustard.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: The Project Anthracite Team.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Levenstein Route&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sulfur mustard can be prepared by treating ethylene with sulfur monochloride (disulfur dichloride, CASRN 10025-67-9). Other similar routes from ethylene using sulfur chlorides are also reported in literature. The utility of sulfur monochloride as a precursor in the production of CWs is reflected by its inclusion in Schedule 3 (3.B.12) of the CWC’s Annex on Chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meyer Process&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thiodiglycol is one of the most useful precursors for the synthesis of sulfur mustard, and as can be seen in Figure 3, many of the routes outlined proceed via thiodiglycol. It is a Schedule 2 (2.B.13) in the CWC’s Annex on Chemicals and can be converted efficiently to sulfur mustard in high yield and purity using a range of chlorinating agents, via the process reported by Meyer. Similar synthetic methods are reported in literature using concentrated hydrochloric acid, hydrogen chloride gas, thionyl chloride, phosphorus trichloride or sulfur chlorides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ethylene Oxide Route&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethylene oxide has widespread industrial uses and can also be a useful precursor to produce sulfur mustard via thiodiglycol. Ethylene oxide can be converted to thiodiglycol by treating with hydrogen sulfide – several methods are published in patents and literature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chlorohydrin Route&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethylene is readily converted into chlorohydrin (2-chloroethanol) by treating it with hypochlorous acid. Chlorohydrin can subsequently be converted to thiodiglycol by treatment with sodium sulfide. Although chlorohydrin is not included in the CWC Annex on Chemicals, it is included in the Australia Group’s (AG) control list for chemical weapons precursors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vinyl Chloride Route&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another notable production method for sulfur mustard was reported by Dupont chemists in 1945, where vinyl chloride was treated with hydrogen sulfide to give sulfur mustard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lewisite&quot;&gt;Lewisite&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lewisite (or lewisite 1) is an organoarsenical compound (2-chlorovinyldichloroarsine) produced by the US, Japan, Germany and the former Soviet Union for use as a CWA. It is a vesicant (blister agent) and included on Schedule 1 of the CWC’s Annex on Chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is produced by a catalytically mediated reaction of arsenic trichloride with acetylene, which produces lewisite in &amp;lt;85% yield, with two significant impurities which are themselves vesicants. They are included in Schedule 1 of the CWC’s Annex on Chemicals: lewisite 2 (bis(2-chlorovinyl) chloroarsine) and lewisite 3 (tris(2-chlorovinyl) arsine).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nitrogen-mustards&quot;&gt;Nitrogen Mustards&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first production of nitrogen mustards occurred in the 1920s, when they were looked at as potential CWAs. Like sulfur mustard and Lewisite, nitrogen mustards are vesicants and their chemical structure shares similarities with sulfur mustard. They are one of the few CW agents which have a legitimate use; HN2 was used as one of the first chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of cancer and is still used today in oncology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of nitrogen mustards is relatively straightforward and can be obtained from chlorination of the corresponding ethanolamine precursor, for example, triethanolamine can be converted to nitrogen mustard (HN3) by the treatment of triethanolamine with thionyl chloride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ethanolamine precursors are all included on Schedule 3 of the CWC’s Annex on Chemicals. Despite being easily converted to Schedule 1 CW agents, the ethanolamines find wide industrial applications. Indeed, triethanolamine, the key precursor for nitrogen mustard (HN3), has multiple industrial uses and is common in most homes as it is included in the formulation of many personal care products. As such it has the highest trading volume of all the scheduled chemicals in the CWC’s Annex on Chemicals. As a result, it was placed in Schedule 3 rather than Schedule 2 of the Annex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Production of ethanolamines is relatively simple. For instance, triethanolamine can be produced on an industrial scale by the reaction of ethylene oxide with aqueous ammonia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nerve-agents&quot;&gt;Nerve Agents&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organophosphorus nerve agents are a class of highly toxic chemical compounds developed for warfare that disrupt the normal functioning of the nervous system, with potentially fatal consequences. Nerve agents interfere with the transmission of nerve impulses by inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, which is essential for muscle control. They were discovered during pesticide research by Germany in the period immediately before the Second World War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tabun (GA)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tabun (GA) is the simplest of the G-series nerve agents to synthesise due to the availability of a range of suitable precursors. As is shown in Figure 6, it can be produced from either phosphorus trichloride or phosphorus oxychloride as the principal phosphorus containing starting materials (both are included in Schedule 3 of the Annex). As shown in Figure 2, phosphorus trichloride can be readily obtained from apatite by the treatment of white phosphorus with chlorine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phosphorus oxychloride is the most convenient precursor for Tabun and can be obtained by chlorinating phosphorus trichloride further to phosphorus pentachloride, which is subsequently reacted with phosphorus pentoxide (to give phosphorus oxychloride).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dimethylamine (DMA), which is required for the synthesis of Tabun, can be readily obtained from ammonia on an industrial scale through a catalytic reaction with methanol at elevated temperatures and high pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sarin (GB), Soman (GD) and Cyclosarin (GF)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The manufacturing processes to produce Sarin (GB), Soman (GD) and Cyclosarin (GF) nerve agents are complicated by the requirement to introduce a phosphorus-carbon bond, which results in additional synthetic steps and precursors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key precursor in the production of these G-series nerve agents is methylphosphonyl dichloride (DC), which can be prepared in a multistep synthesis from phosphorus trichloride. Methylphosphonic dichloride, on reaction with hydrogen fluoride, can be converted to the Schedule 1 precursor methylphosphonic difluoride (DF), which can subsequently easily be converted to the corresponding G-series nerve agent by treatment with the corresponding alcohol, as is shown in Figure 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the Schedule 2 methylphosphonyl dichloride and the Schedule 1 methylphosphonyl difluoride are key precursors for the synthesis of G-agents. While the difluoride has no other use other than the synthesis of G-agents (hence its inclusion on Schedule 1), the dichloride can be used for the synthesis of some pesticides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;V-Agent Production&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VX is the best known of the V-series nerve agents. Originating from pesticide research at ICI, it was developed further at Porton Down in England during the early 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost all reported routes to produce V-agents depend on the availability of methylphosponous dichloride, which can be prepared by the methylation of phosporus trichloride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Methylphosponous dichloride undergoes alcoholysis with ethanol to form the corresponding phosponite which is subsequently transesterified with N,N-diisopropylaminoethanol to produce the Schedule 1 mixed phosphonite O-(2-Diisopropylaminoethyl) O’-ethyl methylphosphonite, commonly referred to as QL, which is a key precursor for the binary VX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The required N,N-diisopropylaminoethanol can be readily produced from ammonia and proceeds via diisopropylamine, as shown in Figure 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has explored the key basic raw materials, processes and precursors required to support a CW programme. It has specifically considered upstream and downstream chemical processing and assessed their relevance to subsequent precursor and CWA production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An earlier study assessed that North Korea has between 2,500 and 5,000 tons of legacy CWs, but the study did not determine if they were produced as part of an indigenous production capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chemical processes outlined in this paper support an assessment that North Korea could gain access to an important toolkit of precursors from basic industrial process that originate either from North Korea’s vast coal resources or its mineral deposits, and such basic industrial processes are essential for a functioning chemical industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chemistry indicates a strong likelihood that North Korea has access to the key precursors and chemical feedstocks that would allow sustained production of sulfur mustard. Figure 2 highlights how many of these key precursors can be readily obtained from downstream processing of coal and other mineral deposits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the key precursor and chemical feedstocks required for the sustained production of nitrogen mustards and lewisite can also be readily obtained from downstream processing of coal and other mineral deposits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper also identifies a reasonable likelihood that North Korea has all the key industrial feedstocks and raw materials to produce the precursors required to support the production of G-series and V-series agents. The significant requirement for more complex organic chemicals means that a mature chemical industry would be required, of which there is only limited evidence. As such, subsequent OSINT work will be required to make a robust assessment of North Korea’s capability to produce G-series and V-series agents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper makes a convincing case for exploring open-source research, trade data, remote sensing and optical imagery to map the industrial processes and production routes described in this paper to sites in North Korea. This will allow for a robust, multisource assessment of North Korea’s chemical industry capabilities, and to what extend they could support a CW programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need to deal with hostile action in a “grey zone” that is neither clearly peace nor war marks the return of an old problem rather than the arrival of a new one. It still needs dealing with. There are some new elements to be considered (for example, how information technology expands the attack surface), making a recently released House of Commons Defence Committee report, Defence in the Grey Zone, a welcome contribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mike Mazar predicted in 2015 the rise of multipolarity and wider scope for putting revisionist motives into practice means grey zone campaigns “will constitute the default mode of conflict in coming decades”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2016 Hal Brands pointed out, grey zone conflict demonstrates the weaknesses of the existing order. It shows how key revisionist states can nibble away at its edges, using incremental and subtly coercive approaches. It shows the limits of existing international security structures to prevent or reverse this coercive behaviour – as seen in the West’s struggle to undo, as opposed to simply punish, Russian aggression in Crimea and Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2017, Nora Bensahel perceived that election of Donald Trump “may make it more likely . . . that the United States will face an increasing number of grey zone conflicts in the coming years.” This is partly because of the President’s relatively “restrained” foreign policy, and – in connection with Hal Brands’ point – Trump has “repeatedly expressed scepticism about international institutions and multinational cooperation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The committee drew evidence from across Europe (Finland, Latvia, the Netherlands), but this commentary recommends consulting like-minded partners further afield. RUSI’s ongoing research on Taiwan’s experience of dealing with hostility in the grey zone points to three insights that are complementary to the report’s findings, and which could contribute to continued cross-Government thinking on how to respond:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eliminate the “grey”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Address the cognitive trap.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Turn the narrative from “escalation” into “resilience”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;eliminate-the-grey&quot;&gt;Eliminate the Grey&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first priority for managing hostile action in the “grey zone” is to reduce the grey zone itself, by doing away with the ambiguities that create confusion on how to respond. This ambiguity takes two forms: disguised identity or intent of the hostile actor, and how the victim situates the act (and justifies the reaction) with reference to points on a spectrum between a state of peace and a state of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identifying the hostile actor for public attribution demands investment in information collection, information flow management (within government and across the public / private interface), and intelligence. The Foreign Secretary’s statement on the China audit of an investment of £600 million in intelligence services is welcome news. Information flow also requires breaking silos and strengthening coordination functions under a well-planned strategic communication strategy. In March 2025, Taiwan’s President Lai made an explicit assessment that China is a “foreign hostile force”. On 16 June, he convened officials from the Ministry of National Defense, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mainland Affairs Council, and National Security Bureau to brief major opposition party leaders on national security issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consistent with orthodox theory on grey zone warfare, the Committee report says “‘Grey zone’ refers to hostile activity below the threshold of direct, state-on-state conflict”, but this begs the question of where that threshold lies. In practical terms, it is a political decision. That decision should be made by the victim and not by the initiator of the action. Eliminating the “grey” can be understood as like dialling up the contrast on an old black and white TV, allowing actions and reactions to be dealt with in the normal legal (white) category, or a “black” category where laws and powers designed for states of emergency up to a state of war can be applied. Liberal democratic society is not naturally well adapted to a state of emergency, but to deal with the grey zone hostility, it needs constitutionally approved measures that safeguard values without offering loopholes for adversaries. Graduated mobilisation and sequential changes in rules of engagement need to be prepared in advance, in consultation with internal and external stakeholders. In March 2025, Taiwan launched a 17-point program that builds out the legal and institutional tool box to deal more effectively with hostile acts like subversion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, the defence committee concludes “current grey zone attacks indicate that Russia already believes it is in an existential struggle with the West,” which takes the wind out of the debate on a meaningful formal “threshold”. This leads us to the next observation, which is that the obstacles to managing hostility in a grey zone are to be found less in the books of law and more between the ears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;address-the-cognitive-trap&quot;&gt;Address the Cognitive Trap&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bureaucratic reform and capability requirements account for most of the committee’s recommendations. While they are important, the vital adjustment is cognitive; specifically, to a mentality that is prepared to enact a prompt comprehensive risk assessment that balances defence with other aspects of national interest. Such an assessment should be made with the resolve to accept there will be times to push back. In a landmark case, in June 2025, Taiwan jailed the captain of a ship – a Chinese national – that had been arrested on suspicion of causing damage to an undersea cable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ambiguity is only a good strategic position when the adversary believes you are prepared to act without perfect certainty about attribution. So long as the adversary believes you will not, you give him an incentive to do as much as possible while hiding his hand. In other words, you incentivise grey zone hostility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an illustration of the problem, the slowness and difficulty in responding to Russian “grey zone” actions in 2014 lay not so much at a conceptual or organisational level, but in the low-risk appetite for escalation. Describing events in new terms such as “hybrid war” and “grey zone” perhaps made it easier to excuse the inability of the Kyiv government and its western supporters to mount an effective response. The reification of the “grey zone” (the term is not part of Russian or Chinese doctrine), and fetishisation of ideas like a “Gerasimov doctrine” and “hybrid war” among Western commentators and theorists obscured more decisive – if unpalatable – factors: Ukraine’s poor organisational discipline, the West’s lack of commitment to deter or resist Russia and run the risk of escalation to a war for which they were materially unprepared and did not wish to fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allowing the “grey zone” concept to influence deliberation on policy choices can be counterproductive. Framing cable cutting as a “grey zone” action rather than “sabotage” endorses the difficulty of attribution and the significance of the attack “below the threshold” of war. The choice to categorise such action as “grey zone” may encourage the perpetrator to think they are less likely to be held accountable or punished, and they will consequently feel less deterred. Using the term “grey zone” in ways that signal self-deterrence, lack of resolve or capability is a cognitive trap to be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, the report’s approach to definitions suggests room for improvement. Noting that the term lacks a generally agreed definition, and that aspects overlap with other concepts such as “hybrid” or “irregular warfare”, it resolves to use “the terms ‘grey zone’ and ‘hybrid’ interchangeably”, then suggests grey zone attacks “can be grouped, in an escalating level of hostile intent, as Influencing, Interfering, Operations and Conflict.” This seems a muddle to say on one hand “grey zone” refers to action below a certain threshold, but then to define it in a group that spans “influencing” and “conflict”. “Operations” could mean anything. To write (as the report does in the Summary) that “the scope is limitless,” also does not help. Sabotage and assassination are attacks and must be identified and dealt with as such.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report recognises the importance of a “willingness to use . . . capabilities either to deny or to punish those undertaking or authorising grey zone attacks”, but for a product of the defence establishment, its recommendations on what sort of capabilities are needed to inflict appropriate “punishment”, or how to help leadership determine when it is required, are strangely muted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reject-the-narrative-of-escalation-for-one-of-resilience&quot;&gt;Reject the Narrative of “Escalation” for One of “Resilience”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Action in the grey zone is designed to be morally asymmetric, in other words, the initiator disguises their intention or identity to cause the victim to hesitate to take effective action for fear of being accused of “escalation”. Failure to resist the narrative power of grey zone tactics can foster a sense of helplessness. To discredit attempts to blame the victim for trouble making and to gain the initiative, Taiwan’s government has promoted a narrative (with institutional backing) based on democratic and whole of society resilience. This allows moves that set strong positions pre-emptively, shifting the burden of escalation liability onto the other party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The House of Commons report has a section entitled “building homeland resilience”, but here there is a glaring contradiction in this area of HMG policy. The former head of MI6, Sir Alex Younger told the committee of China “if you want a textbook on subversion, cyber and political harassment, it is all there”. Subsequently the UK China Audit “a full spectrum of threats – from espionage and cyber-attacks, to the repression of Hong Kongers, and attacks on the rules-based order . . . our protections must extend more widely than they currently do”. This grey zone report acknowledges “malicious foreign powers seek to influence the public debate, including on the war in Ukraine, by covert means, including influencing operations”, yet the government declined to list China on the enhanced tier of its new Foreign Influence Registration Scheme (FIRS). Ministers appear to support a request for China to open larger embassy premises, which would broaden its base to exert influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this respect, Taiwan is well ahead of the UK. Despite the fact something near 40% of its exports go to China, the government in Taipei has tightened rather than shied away from measures to prevent subversion, espionage, and illicit influence from the PRC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “grey zone” is not a fact of life to be accepted, but the natural consequence of a collective failure of commitment to upholding global order. As with any space neglected by order and enforcement, it is a hospitable base for predatory and unaccountable aggression. Developing capabilities and coordination is part of the solution, but ultimately it is more and unavoidably a problem of intellectual honesty and political confidence. The defence committee has done its part, but the government as a whole would do well to consult more widely on how to make the more UK resilient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transatlantic relationship is being recast. The second Trump administration has made clear that the United States wants Europe to handle European security, representing a dramatic shift in U.S. foreign policy on a scale not seen since World War II. While the scope of the transformation of U.S. involvement in Europe remains to be seen, the trajectory of the transatlantic alliance will also dramatically impact the vaunted special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom. These shifts substantively challenge the status quo of British defense strategy, wedging the United Kingdom between rising expectations for its defense capabilities and mounting resource constraints. As London takes a sober look at its long-term approach through its recent Strategic Defense Review, a refreshed understanding of the special relationship is critical to developing a strategy to maximize U.S.-UK defense cooperation and equip both partners to face the challenges ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This “special relationship”—a phrase coined by Winston Churchill in his famous 1946 “Iron Curtain” speech—was forged to address crises in European and global security. The deep intelligence, defense, and security working partnership that formed during World War II persists to this day. During the Cold War, military and defense industrial cooperation, especially in the nuclear realm, grew significantly to combat the Soviet threat, as did intelligence cooperation. Since then, the United States and United Kingdom have operated together in the Persian Gulf, the Balkans, Iraq, and Afghanistan. A shared strategic outlook, whether in defeating Nazism, communism, or terrorism, helped forge a close bond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the special relationship is not as meaningful as it once was. An honest audit of bilateral ties over the past decade reflects a partnership that has faded in relevance to policymakers, especially in Washington. This is partly because the two countries are no longer fighting side by side in Iraq and Afghanistan—but not entirely. In recent years, the United Kingdom has been consumed with Brexit, become estranged from Europe, suffered sluggish economic growth, and implemented cuts to its military forces. This has made it a less relevant actor in Europe, a less relevant global economic player, and less of a global military presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite a war raging in Ukraine, Washington has shifted its focus to the Indo-Pacific and the challenge posed by China. Meanwhile, its emphasis on economic security, competition with China, and sanctioning Russia has also meant more coordination and engagement with the European Union given its colossal single market. The United Kingdom’s estrangement from the European Union has made it more peripheral to these conversations and less able to play its former role as a transatlantic bridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With new governments in both London and Washington, policymakers face a critical opportunity to refresh and strengthen the special relationship and make it fit for purpose. Thus far, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and U.S. President Donald Trump have gotten off to a strong start. Despite coming from different sides of the political spectrum, they appear to have developed a personal rapport—similar to past political opposites such as Barack Obama and David Cameron or George W. Bush and Tony Blair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the United Kingdom, strengthening the special relationship will require rebuilding relations with Europe and leading in continental affairs, as this is what has made it most relevant to the United States—whether during World War II, the Cold War, or today. Thus, efforts to rebuild ties with the European Union, focus more on NATO, and take the lead on supporting Ukraine, for example, will help the United Kingdom position itself as a transatlantic bridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, London must focus and streamline its defense efforts given its significant resource constraints. The special relationship has largely entailed close alignment and cooperation on almost every issue in every region—at times leaving the United Kingdom overstretched and creating situations where it is unable to live up to ambitious rhetoric. Recognizing that it cannot be everything to everyone in the U.S. government, the United Kingdom will need to focus its bilateral efforts in a few areas in which it excels. This is where the Strategic Defence Review (SDR) could be critical to reviving the special relationship. Upon taking office in the summer of 2024, Starmer ordered a top-to-bottom review of the British military. The resulting report, issued on June 2, 2025, provides a forward-looking assessment of the country’s strategic interests and requisite military capabilities. Its release meets the moment with a strategic vision that seeks to reinforce the value of close cooperation for partners on both sides of the Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The task ahead will not be easy. The Trump administration is increasingly at odds with Europe, creating a widening diplomatic gulf. This makes the United Kingdom’s potential role as a transatlantic bridge more vital than ever—but also more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper briefly outlines the current U.S.-UK defense and security relationship. It then assesses the feasibility of the SDR’s objectives and its implications for U.S. foreign policy in Europe and beyond. Finally, it weighs the tough choices that lie ahead for British defense policymakers given the United Kingdom’s economic constraints, new U.S. foreign policy priorities, and intensifying geopolitical competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mapping-the-special-relationship-on-defense&quot;&gt;Mapping the Special Relationship on Defense&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ties between the United States and United Kingdom benefit greatly from a relatively aligned strategic culture and way of viewing the world. The two countries have historically held similar threat perceptions of adversaries and tend to have a broader conception of national interests, lending them a willingness and readiness to act militarily in the world. For instance, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, both countries rushed forward military assistance and rallied European allies to action through a comprehensive sanctions response. Preserving and strengthening the special relationship is not only a core British foreign policy interest, it has also been a priority for every U.S. president since Franklin D. Roosevelt. Far from being merely rhetorical, the special relationship is exceptionally deep, especially when it comes to defense and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;intelligence&quot;&gt;Intelligence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two countries have built the deepest intelligence alliance in the history of the Western world. It has been gradually forged through the common fight against Hitler’s fascism, Soviet communism, and the Global War on Terror. In the aftermath of World War II, the two nations agreed to collect and share sensitive signals intelligence as part of the 1946 United Kingdom–United States of America (UKUSA) Agreement. At the time, the United States leaned heavily on well-established British intelligence capabilities from across the vast British Overseas Territories and Commonwealth to surveil Soviet activities. This cooperation laid the foundation for the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance between the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, which was formalized in 1956.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Five Eyes has since developed into the world’s most significant intelligence-sharing alliance, rooted in extensive coordination and sharing of both raw and finished intelligence. In many ways, it is considered the gold standard of intelligence alliances and represents the backbone of the special relationship. For example, the United Kingdom benefited immensely from Five Eyes intelligence sharing during the Cold War, when U.S. monitoring of Soviet submarines proved vital to coordinated defensive efforts in the North Atlantic and North Sea. In return, British listening posts in its former imperial territories provided crucial signals intelligence to the United States on Soviet activities in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Functionally, the Five Eyes operates across a wide spectrum of domains and geographies. Allied intelligence organizations monitor maritime traffic through strategic areas, surveil ballistic missile tests and satellite deployments, and coordinate on collective offensive capabilities in the cyber domain. Moreover, numerous agreements exist in discrete, highly sensitive areas such as chemical and biological defense, which entail extensive technical cooperation at the working level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nuclear-technology&quot;&gt;Nuclear Technology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cooperation on nuclear technology is another core tenet of the special relationship with roots in the early Cold War era. The 1958 Mutual Defense Agreement formed the basis for closer ties and allowed the UK nuclear arsenal to incorporate U.S. technological advancements. Since 1962, the United Kingdom has acquired U.S. nuclear weapons delivery technology while producing its own submarines and warheads. Furthermore, its Trident system, which includes four Vanguard-class nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed submarines, relies on maintenance by U.S. company Lockheed Martin, and the United Kingdom procures the aeroshells required to produce warheads from the United States. The Trident system is thus closely linked to U.S. systems, though they ostensibly operate independently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mutual Defense Agreement was extended indefinitely in 2024 and includes provisions that make it difficult for either party to terminate the arrangement. Locking in the bilateral nuclear-sharing arrangement on a more or less permanent footing has provided some important assurances of continued U.S.-UK cooperation, irrespective of domestic political changes. Moreover, the extension provides some stability and budget certainty at a time when London is modernizing its stockpile of nuclear weapons and delivery systems, replacing the aging Vanguard-class submarines with a new Dreadnought-class platform that will enter into service in the early 2030s. Budget overruns and delays related to this modernization drive a significant risk, as the Dreadnought program has already led to a 41 percent increase in projected costs for the Royal Navy as of December 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;defense-industrial-base&quot;&gt;Defense Industrial Base&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2021 Defence and Security Industrial Strategy (DSIS) reoriented strategic thinking about the British defense industrial base. It emphasized building a resilient defense industry without reliance on foreign suppliers—a marked shift from past governments’ tendency to outsource defense production to reduce costs. Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Covid-19 pandemic, and Brexit have shifted attention across the political spectrum toward prioritizing maintenance of a sustainable UK industrial base. The SDR recognizes the UK defense industry as a vital engine for growth, both in its security ambitions and long-term economic outlook. In FY 2023, the Ministry of Defence invested nearly $40 billion with UK industry, supporting 440,000 jobs. Defense industrial relationships, the most significant being with the United States, contributed to $19.7 billion in overall British defense exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States remains the United Kingdom’s closest defense partner. Its Foreign Military Sales portfolio with the United States is valued at more than $18.6 billion in joint projects, particularly the F-35 program, demonstrating the high level of interoperability and industrial integration that characterizes the relationship. As a tier-one partner on the program, the United Kingdom contributes critical components to the F-35 supply chain, with approximately 15 percent of the value of each aircraft attributable to the United Kingdom. This includes the Martin-Baker ejection seat, Cobham refueling probes, and BAE Systems tail sections. As a result, the F-35 plays a significant role in the British labor market. The Royal Air Force’s XVII Test and Evaluation Squadron, housed at Edwards Air Base in California, operates primarily to bring F-35 aircraft into service. The partnership, focused on integrated procurement and maintenance, has been a foundation of economic competitiveness in defense for both partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2021 Australia–United Kingdom–United States (AUKUS) agreement enhances the unique bond between the three treaty allies and ensures cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. The last time a similar agreement was reached was in 1958 with the U.S.-UK Mutual Defense Agreement. AUKUS aims to promote a “free and open Indo-Pacific that is peaceful, secure, and stable,” as reflected in two main pillars. Pillar One focuses on delivery of nuclear-powered attack submarine capabilities, including highly sensitive nuclear propulsion technology that Washington has historically held sacred. By 2040, the SSN-AUKUS will replace the United Kingdom’s Astute-class attack submarine as one of the world’s most advanced submarines. Pillar Two is broader and more complex, with a clear focus on enhancing joint capabilities and interoperability across several domains, including “cyber capabilities, artificial intelligence, quantum technologies, and additional undersea capabilities,” as well as electronic warfare, hypersonic technologies, and enhanced information-sharing protocols. Its implementation will demand investment in both the U.S. and UK defense industrial bases, relying on joint innovation and shared research and development. So far, however, there has been limited progress made on implementing Pillar Two. Looking forward, the success of AUKUS will not solely depend on adequate financing; just as critical will be whether the United Kingdom has the infrastructure to produce innovative technology at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, regulatory reforms, particularly the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) exemptions announced in September 2024, have attempted to ease export controls and other regulatory barriers that had limited U.S.-UK defense industrial integration. Removing such barriers could accelerate procurement opportunities and access to both countries’ defense technology sectors but also has the potential to form a trilateral common market on defense that incentivizes strengthening this relationship. Such trilateral defense cooperation could enhance battlefield integration and technological innovation across theaters. Consequently, the AUKUS partnership offers a strategic counterweight to China and reinforces allied unity in a rapidly evolving landscape of geopolitical competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;basing&quot;&gt;Basing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States, which has maintained military bases in the United Kingdom since 1942, currently deploys approximately 10,000 military personnel on British soil, not including a significant number of contractors and civilian employees. In turn, approximately 750 military and civilian personnel with the Ministry of Defence train at U.S. military bases across 30 states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each nation also benefits from the other’s global footprint of military bases. The United States has utilized military infrastructure in overseas UK territories, such as Ascension Island in the Atlantic Ocean and Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, which has housed a shared U.S.-UK military base since the 1970s. The United Kingdom finalized an agreement in May 2025 on the future of the Diego Garcia archipelago that would hand territory over to Mauritius but allow the Diego Garcia base to continue operation on a 99-year lease. The negotiations, while met with criticism by defense hawks in both the United Kingdom and United States, emphasized the territory’s strategic importance for power projection of two uniquely entangled allies by focusing on maintaining joint operational forces and power projection in the region. Importantly, the United States was not an official party in the agreement. However, the final agreement was met with high praise by the Trump administration as a vital success for U.S. national security interests in the Indian Ocean and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;special-operations-forces&quot;&gt;Special Operations Forces&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interactions between the U.S. and UK militaries have historically taken place through a patchwork of relationships between specialized communities. Although there are no formal frameworks governing cooperation, the relationship between the countries’ special operations forces is particularly significant in this regard. From a U.S. perspective, what the UK forces have not been able to deliver in terms of quantity has been compensated by their quality and interoperability with U.S. units. For example, the two countries have deployed special forces together as part of the Joint Special Operations Command Task Force in the Iraq War, a temporary grouping often assigned to engage high-value targets. U.S. and UK special operations units also regularly train together, both on a bilateral level and through NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-united-kingdoms-current-strategic-dilemma&quot;&gt;The United Kingdom’s Current Strategic Dilemma&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-united-kingdom-and-europe-after-brexit&quot;&gt;The United Kingdom and Europe After Brexit&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2016, British voters opted to leave the European Union in a referendum that altered the economic and political trajectory of the United Kingdom. In the ensuing nine years, the United country has become more estranged from the continent and has experienced economic stagnation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the Brexit vote, UK strategy sought to turn away from Europe and toward the rest of the world. Prime Minister Teresa May declared that the post-Brexit era of “Global Britain” was beginning. After officially departing the European Union on December 31, 2020, the UK government conducted an “Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy,” in essence a national security strategy, that paid almost no attention to Europe. Instead, “Global Britain” would aggressively seek new trading agreements around the world. For instance, the United Kingdom signed onto the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement involving 11 countries in the Indo-Pacific and the Americas, in July 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, instead of accelerating growth by removing the “shackles” of EU regulation, Brexit has created structural barriers that have exacerbated the United Kingdom’s economic challenges. In particular, it has made it more cumbersome to do business with the European Union. Given the European Union has around 450 million people and is an economy roughly equivalent in size to the United States or China in terms of purchasing power, Brexit erected barriers to an enormous neighboring market in which British producers had been highly enmeshed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Separately, following the Global Financial Crisis of 2007–08, London enacted deep austerity measures. A lack of economic investment, together with the uncertainty and friction from Brexit, has led to sluggish growth and reduced investment. Covid-19 also contributed to high inflation, which was then exacerbated by an energy crisis following the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, leaving the United Kingdom with some of the highest energy prices in Europe. The United Kingdom was the only member of the G7 yet to restore pre-pandemic levels of GDP by 2023, with foreign direct investment inflows falling 37 percent for six years prior. It then slipped into a technical recession in the final quarter of 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a defense policy perspective, the United Kingdom is facing a myriad of resource constraints that will hinder its ability to be as capable a global partner for the United States as it has been in the past. Despite recent efforts to ramp up defense spending to meet NATO commitments, the British Armed Forces are anemic after decades of budget cuts—spending began winding down at the end of the Cold War and has fallen an additional 22 percent between FY 2009 and FY 2016. Similarly, between 2014 and 2023, following Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea, the United Kingdom displayed the lowest real increase in defense spending among NATO members, totaling a mere 6.84 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;enter-the-strategic-defence-review&quot;&gt;Enter the Strategic Defence Review&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In announcing the Strategic Defence Review (SDR) in July 2024, Starmer identified an opportunity for the United Kingdom to be a leader in an increasingly “dangerous and volatile world.” His new Labour government commissioned the SDR as a broad and comprehensive effort to reassess “the threats Britain faces, the capabilities needed to meet them, the state of UK armed forces and the resources available.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revising London’s overarching defense strategy has become a regular practice in the past decade, this being the third iteration in the past five years. But the SDR is intended to be different. Its scope, process, and context suggest a complete strategic overhaul. According to Secretary of State for Defense John Healey, it is the “first of its kind” and will set the direction for the Starmer administration. It seeks to be more akin to the sweeping changes in the United States brought about by the Goldwater–Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous UK defense strategy was produced in 2023 by the Conservative government following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. While its key takeaways doubled down on many of the trends identified in the 2021 review, two years of war on the European continent and an increasingly volatile threat assessment demanded a shift toward building military capacity and stockpiles to fight a conventional war. Prior reviews had largely failed to address key questions concerning capability gaps in national defense and the United Kingdom’s contribution to NATO. They also offered little fiscal flexibility for the country to shape new procurement processes or rapidly rearm itself. The 2023 defense strategy increased defense spending by only £2.5 billion ($3.2 billion) compared to the 2021 strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2025 SDR attempts to challenge the existing status quo, especially regarding defense and procurement processes. Notably, the review was led by an independent panel of experts rather than just internal figures within the Ministry of Defence. Its chair, former NATO Secretary General George Robertson, worked alongside General Sir Richard Barrons and former senior White House national security official Fiona Hill. Their review was supported by perspectives from nearly 150 experts from across government, the military, industry, academia, international partners, and the public. The report very much digests the lessons learned from Ukraine and is focused on how to get the United Kingdom ready for war. While the report does not outwardly say that the United Kingdom is unprepared, that is the obvious conclusion. Matthew Savill of the Royal United Services Institute concludes “the implication is clear: assuming this is what it takes to be ready for modern war, then the UK is lagging badly.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key challenge for the United Kingdom is that its armed forces, particularly its army, are not big enough. The review says the end strength should be increased “when funding allows.” To make up for the lack of size and the significant costs of many of the weapons used to equip the force, the SDR seeks to leverage technology to increase overall firepower, as well as to better integrate UK forces together to increase their battlefield impact. A key focus is also on defense production and producing cost-effective munitions and drones. In assessing the SDR, Olivia O’Sullivan and Marion Messmer at Chatham House write, “A central commitment is the development of ‘always on’ munitions capacity—creating an industry that is capable of rapidly increasing production in the event of high-intensity conflict. That is a key lesson from Ukraine.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SDR also seeks to provide a framework ensuring that UK forces can prepare and deter against threats under a broad range of parameters. This includes the country’s commitment to nuclear deterrence, homeland security, support for Ukraine, retention of personnel, technological innovation, and procurement strategy. As for nuclear deterrence, the United Kingdom has recently announced it will procure the F-35A Lightning variant, which is able to deliver nuclear payloads, thereby adding a second leg to the country’s submarine-based nuclear deterrent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the core of the SDR is a “NATO-first” approach that nevertheless attempts to maintain a global role for the United Kingdom. The review includes plans to move quickly to warfighting readiness, including efforts to modernize the country’s force structure to enable integrated multidomain operations and improve efficiency in its acquisition and support strategy. The review highlights key organizational reforms that consider how the government can employ emerging technologies and reinforce partnerships to strengthen its capabilities in areas of vulnerability. Using a whole-of-society approach and key lessons learned from the war in Ukraine, it outlines how the United Kingdom can accelerate national preparedness and wartime resilience while continuing to lead in international coalitions such as AUKUS and the Northern European Joint Expeditionary Force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report also highlights the importance of coordinating procurement with European NATO partners. This is an important nod to the growing effort within the European Union to create economies of scale and to reduce the sprawling number of systems employed by European militaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-tough-choices-ahead&quot;&gt;The Tough Choices Ahead&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;London faces a strategic dilemma: it seeks to pursue an ambitious defense agenda but must abide by considerable resource constraints. This effort will necessitate reassessing Britain’s strategic footprint in Europe and Asia, recalibrating its defense relationship with the European Union, and identifying internal reforms to address personnel, defense industrial, and process and bureaucratic issues currently straining its armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The priorities for reform are vast and span a suite of issues, including centering emerging technology as the backbone of the British Armed Forces, ensuring domestic resilience, increasing the efficiency of procurement processes, and setting the right balance between land- and sea-focused forces. The SDR reviewers were carefully instructed to make their recommendations feasible “within the trajectory” of a spending increase from the current 2.3 percent of GDP on defense to the NATO target of 2.5 percent. This was a budgetary challenge before the 2025 NATO Summit. Now, London supposedly seeks to dramatically increase its defense spending commitments in the medium term, as Starmer joined NATO leaders in the Hague in their commitment to significantly raise the spending target to 3.5 percent on core defense and an additional 1.5 percent on defense-related areas. To hit these targets would require an additional $41 billion annually, and it is unclear where that money will come from. What is clear, is that although the British government has accepted all 62 recommendations set out by the SDR since its release, implementing the kind of structural shift the review demands will be easier said than done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reality of overall strategic reform means the United Kingdom will confront a swathe of hard choices in the coming years. Several high-profile initiatives take up a significant portion of the UK defense budget. For example, the cost of maintaining a nuclear deterrent has risen from 5–6 percent of defense spending around five years ago to at least 19 percent in 2025. The AUKUS agreement to build submarines for Australia—as well as the Global Combat Air Programme, a project to develop a next-generation stealth fighter jet with Italy and Japan—is not only expensive but also seemingly “set in stone” in future UK defense budgets. Additionally, the SDR believes the size of the army needs to grow, yet there is no funding presently to increase end strength. This leaves little maneuvering room to fill other capability gaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;global-britain-or-nato-first&quot;&gt;“Global Britain” or “NATO First?”&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Successive U.S. administrations have been inconsistent in how they want London to allocate resources between Europe and Asia. The Biden administration pushed European allies to ramp up their activities in the Indo-Pacific, for example, through freedom of navigation exercises in the South China Sea. Officials from the Trump administration have signaled a reversal of this course by suggesting that the UK military should focus squarely on the Euro-Atlantic region, particularly in support of Ukraine. A 2024 CSIS report argued that the United Kingdom should focus on leading in Europe, given the threat posed by Russia and the challenges of contributing in the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this regard, the United Kingdom could increase London’s importance to both Washington and Brussels, as well as other European capitals, by contributing to the building of a European pillar of NATO. With the potential for a significant reduction in the United States’ military presence in Europe on the horizon, the United Kingdom—the only non-U.S. NATO member that assigns its strategic deterrent to NATO—is uniquely positioned to mediate a new burden-sharing or burden-shifting arrangement. Bolstering ties with Europe’s economic and military powerhouses—France, Germany, and Poland—may lay the foundation for a new “European Quad” leadership group to coordinate efforts to support Ukraine, rearm Europe, and deter Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-joint-expeditionary-force&quot;&gt;The Joint Expeditionary Force&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doubling down on British leadership of the Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) is also a worthwhile pursuit. The JEF is led by the United Kingdom and counts nine other nations as members, including the Netherlands and the eight Nordic and Baltic states, and is intended to provide a rapid response capacity. Leaning into the JEF might also offer a pathway to mitigate the gap left by expected reductions in U.S. forces. From its foundation in NATO’s “Framework of Nations” concept, the JEF has become an important cog in the broader European defense architecture. JEF nations are also among the highest spenders on defense in Europe—making the force a potentially vital avenue for sustaining European deterrence in the near term as the continent reacts to a reduced U.S. presence. As Ed Arnold of the Royal United Services Institute notes: “If the US disengages, no single European power, or groups, can fill the vacuum. Therefore, an update to the RPG [regional planning group] model and increased regionalisation might be the only way to keep NATO together in a configuration that is close to its current form.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the JEF’s importance would grow following any U.S. troop departures, the force should not be seen or marketed as a like-for-like replacement for U.S. forces, especially ground forces, on the continent. The Nordic and Baltic countries in the JEF certainly have capable militaries, but the force does not include Europe’s large continental military powers: France, Germany, and Poland. Moreover, while some Europeans might see a United Kingdom that is newly reengaged with Europe on defense as a good-enough replacement for the United States, UK military capacity is nowhere near what it once was, particularly when it comes to ground forces. London thus needs to market the JEF soberly—not as a cure to American-less European defense but as an important tool that enhances the continent’s overall security. A strong JEF does not obviate the need to construct a more integrated European defense effort, whether through NATO or outside of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;aukus&quot;&gt;AUKUS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite seemingly being focused on Australia and the Indo-Pacific, the lines of effort in AUKUS are relatively geographically agnostic, meaning its applications are strategically beneficial in both the European and Indo-Pacific arenas. U.S. technologies shared through Pillar Two will increase the United Kingdom’s role as a top-tier undersea power and strengthen its capabilities in the North Atlantic. To achieve such ambitions, specific recommendations for restructuring found in the SDR will certainly help. Local-national partnerships to combat historic underinvestment in Barrow—a town critical to the United Kingdom’s defense manufacturing goals—seek to reignite progress by identifying critical early-stage commercial innovation and ensuring adequate resources. Such a focus could overhaul stagnation in implementation for Pillar Two and strengthen the country’s nuclear deterrent. In a transatlantic context, reinforcing the United Kingdom’s commitment to AUKUS also deepens ties in the U.S.-UK nuclear relationship, furthering innovation goals that position both countries at the forefront of military technology. Its focus on developing critical and globally competitive technologies to expand economic and strategic influence further strengthens the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;London’s well-established partnerships could help it fill specific gaps in Western force posture and command and control that could develop amid a U.S. withdrawal. Yet key challenges remain, notably the weak and fragmented nature of European defense cooperation, which historically has depended on a mixture of bilateral agreements, NATO contributions, and small-group cooperation on specific issue sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;uk-eu-relations&quot;&gt;UK-EU Relations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the United Kingdom is to lead on European security, it needs to deepen cooperation with the European Union—not just to bolster its own defense industrial base, but to shape and support the continent’s collective security ambitions. At the UK-EU summit in May, a defense and security agreement was reached that lays the groundwork for British inclusion in growing European defense initiatives. However, a more complex agreement will be necessary to grant UK companies access to the European Union’s new €150 billion lending facility, the Security Action for Europe (SAFE) fund. While SAFE provides financing to member states, it may pave the way for other EU defense initiatives. If the bloc becomes an active weapons procurer, whether through budget growth or issuing joint debt through eurobonds, the United Kingdom will want to be part of that structure. Brussels has also made it a priority to involve London given how important British firms are to the broader European defense industrial base. However, UK integration into these initiatives will likely require “paying in,” perhaps by contributing to the EU budget or servicing EU debt. Other non-EU NATO countries such as Norway already contribute to the EU budget and therefore are included in its defense initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Conclusion and Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starmer’s Labour government has its work cut out for it to revive economic growth and maintain fiscal prudence, all the while navigating a volatile global landscape mired by trade uncertainty and a revanchist Russia eyeing Europe’s eastern flank. However, Britain’s economic outlook has left the government little budget space to make an ambitious reform agenda reality. Within this context, the following general recommendations for the United Kingdom would help ensure the continued vitality of the special relationship:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continue to lead on Ukraine.&lt;/strong&gt; London and Paris have led the effort to create a “coalition of the willing” to send peacekeeping forces to Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire or peace agreement. However, with talks unlikely to settle the conflict, and with the United States unlikely to allocate more military aid to Ukraine under the Trump administration, the United Kingdom should instead play a vital role in sustaining Ukraine. This could involve more bilateral military assistance, such as the most recent package of air defense support promised by Starmer in June, or encouraging and participating in a collective EU effort to aid Ukraine, as argued in a recent CSIS report. A sustained commitment to a peacekeeping force will not only require spending but also adhering to recommendations in the SDR to overcome long-standing issues with recruitment and retention in UK forces. Moreover, London, which has shared significant intelligence with Kyiv and allies, should plan to help fill or mitigate gaps in case the United States cuts off intelligence support to Ukraine again—as it did for a week after the disastrous Oval Office meeting between Presidents Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky on February 28, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus U.S.-UK relations on European security.&lt;/strong&gt; If the United Kingdom takes a leadership role in Europe, it will become more important to the United States, allowing London to once again serve as a transatlantic bridge and translator of events in Europe, something that was lost post-Brexit.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep working with the European Union on defense, and push the European Union to do more.&lt;/strong&gt; Instead of trying to work around the European Union and encourage other “like-minded” European countries to do the same, the United Kingdom should be encouraging member states to leverage the bloc’s untapped power and capacity, especially to generate resources for defense and rationalize and integrate the European defense sector. It should also push for greater EU cooperation and integration with NATO, particularly regarding funding for defense activities. Having London adopt a forward-leaning posture on EU defense initiatives not only makes sense on merit, it would also help spur an improvement in relations with the European Union and position it to lead on defense in Europe. This should also be encouraged by the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take the lead on European defense planning, intelligence, and strategy.&lt;/strong&gt; The United Kingdom should be prepared to help fill any defense planning and strategy gap left in the wake of a U.S. force withdrawal. Presently, it is the United States European Command (EUCOM) that thinks holistically about the defense of Europe. It is important that European nations also build capacity for similar thinking and planning, whether within NATO or outside of it—with London taking a lead role.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize economic growth.&lt;/strong&gt; A more prosperous United Kingdom is one that will invest more funds into defense. Therefore, the United States should encourage the United Kingdom and European Union to take steps to lower economic barriers between them. The United Kingdom exports almost as much to the European Union as it does to the rest of the world combined. Therefore, improving cross-channel economic relations is not just beneficial from an economic perspective but will help improve economic growth, allowing the country to invest more in defense. Conversely, the United States should avoid steps that impinge on the United Kingdom’s growth. While it is positive that an agreement was reached to lower the tariffs placed on UK imports by the Trump administration, the remaining 10 percent blanket U.S. tariffs, in concert with 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminum auto parts, will harm the United Kingdom’s economic outlook.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ensure Washington has right-sized expectations for the special relationship.&lt;/strong&gt; The United States needs to recognize the fiscal and military realities confronting the United Kingdom and adjust its expectations accordingly. Too often Washington has expected London to be able to do everything the United States does, just at a slightly smaller scale. It should anticipate a greater division of labor in the special relationship and encourage the United Kingdom to set clear priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow through on established priorities.&lt;/strong&gt; Lengthy government reports often start out claiming to want to set clear priorities but struggle to balance many competing interests. The SDR has pledged to ruthlessly prioritize—and now needs to follow through. Moreover, Washington has initiative fatigue from its UK partners. As the United Kingdom has had four prime ministers in just the past three years, British officials have been continuously presenting new strategy documents and initiatives to Washington, which is left bewildered about the United Kingdom’s strategic direction. London needs to set a course and stick to it, as well as narrow the scope of its commitments with an eye to its resource limitations This is particularly necessary because U.S. policy toward Europe’s security remains incoherent and inconsistent. Far from showing weakness, this will demonstrate the United Kingdom’s reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlight the innovative aspects of the SDR to U.S. and European defense planners.&lt;/strong&gt; The SDR seeks to internalize the lessons of the war in Ukraine and adapt those lessons to a modern NATO military. Thus, there is much for other NATO militaries to learn from this review. Of great interest to the alliance are areas relating to procurement, future force structure and design, innovation and technological adaptation, and private sector innovation, to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SDR’s focus on speeding up and streamlining procurement is of particular relevance across the alliance. The SDR hits the current UK procurement system hard. Grace Cassy of Chatham House, part of the SDR review team, says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Procurement takes an average of 6.5 years for projects with a value of more than £20 million. The result is that the UK has a narrow base of large suppliers who have the balance sheet to survive the procurement cycle. Digital capabilities have been de-prioritized to fund other long-running equipment programmes. Put simply, the UK has raided the future to pay for the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That assessment is no doubt similar in almost every ministry of defense in NATO, as well as at the Pentagon in the United States. The United Kingdom should thus widely share its findings—at both the political and technical level. Importantly, the United Kingdom should not just view this as a one-off diplomatic engagement but should track lessons learned as it seeks to implement many of the recommendations and should brief allies and partners in the coming years about its experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2025 SDR is a clear inflection point for British defense strategy and makes clear that several of the key forces challenging the special relationship have come to a point. The United Kingdom does not have the military presence or capacity it once did and, in many ways, is struggling to define a clear global identity and role in the European security architecture. At the same time, the storied relationship between the United States and United Kingdom, combined with the potential for focused and productive growth laid out by the SDR, proves that the United Kingdom is still an incredibly impactful ally for the United States. This is why it is vital for both partners to right-size expectations in the special relationship and focus on redefining a purpose-driven relationship—for one, concrete development in UK military capabilities will enhance its preparedness for war in an increasingly treacherous global landscape. It will also demonstrate an effort to appease President Trump’s calls for Europe to take a big step up in its defense spending, which may help keep trade tensions at bay and help the United Kingdom grow economically without falling victim to transatlantic economic tensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By establishing a complete strategic overhaul, the United Kingdom has established a resource-intensive but high-reward outlook for the future of its defense capabilities. The SDR focuses on lessons learned from the war in Ukraine and a path to take tangible steps forward in innovation, procurement, and economic growth. Britain’s leadership role in supporting Ukraine among European countries offers a clear model for its persona going forward, particularly as the United States contemplates pulling back from the European theater. However, doing so will require streamlining limited resources to enhance its capabilities in areas of acute strategic advantage which ultimately benefit allied interests in Europe. Pivoting its strategy or resources to attempt to meet unrealistic demands could set the United Kingdom up for immense failure in its attempt to increase wartime preparedness, and may even inhibit critical growth in all aspects of its economy. Instead, the focus should be on lowering trade barriers between both partners to revitalize the British economy, support the domestic defense industrial base, and ultimately make the goals presented in the SDR for British defense capabilities significantly more palpable despite serious challenges ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the short period since the SDR’s release, it is clear that the road ahead will not be easy. The special relationship rests at the heart of its future, but the key to maintaining the vitality of U.S.-UK ties will be a focused effort to stick to a plan that sets reasonable expectations and concretely meet the goals it lays out. This demands a sober calculation of its resource constraints and what the United Kingdom can reasonably deliver with respect to both its short- and long-term security goals.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;律政司：《基本法》賦權否決財案不代表可「為所欲為」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;律政司基本法賦權否決財案不代表可為所欲為&quot;&gt;律政司：《基本法》賦權否決財案不代表可「為所欲為」&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/26FEGpi.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2020年初選47人涉嫌串謀顛覆國家政權，其中31名被告認罪，不認罪16人當中有14人經審訊後被裁定罪成，李予信及劉偉聰2人罪脫。11人不服定罪上訴，認罪的黃子悅提刑期上訴。案件今（15日）在西九龍法院（暫代高院上訴庭）繼續上訴聆訊。律政司一方回應昨日上訴一方的陳詞，指「無差別」否決財政預算案迫使特首下台，明顯地是違背了《基本法》第73條所定下的立會職權，構成濫權；又指《基本法》附件已訂立指引如何達到「雙普選」，批評上訴方利用爭取普選來合理化否決財案的行為，只是轉移視線。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後上訴方就各人的案情陳詞。其中鄭達鴻一方指，當時願意跟隨公民黨否決財案的路線，是為了得到黨的支持而參選初選和其後的立法會選舉，這與他一旦當選後會否按自己意願還是「跟黨投票」並不相同，惟原審法庭未有對鄭與黨之間想法上的分歧給予充份比重。梁國雄一方則指，早在案發之前已曾投票反對財案，因未有包含全民退休保障或任何幫助基層的措施，強調並非「為否決而否決」，而是考慮過財案利弊才決定投什麼票。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/SjESmK6.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 梁國雄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;由高院首席法官潘兆初、上訴庭法官彭偉昌及彭寶琴審理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;經審訊後被裁定罪成並提出上訴的11名被告包括：何啟明、陳志全、鄒家成、吳政亨、何桂藍、鄭達鴻、余慧明、黃碧雲、林卓廷、楊雪盈和梁國雄。認罪囚4年5個月的黃子悅，則提出刑期上訴。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;律政司代表包括：副刑事檢控專員周天行、高級檢控官吳加悅、徐倩姿和莊文欣等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;律政司基本法已指引如何達至普選-質疑上訴方以爭取普選來合理化否決財案&quot;&gt;律政司：《基本法》已指引如何達至普選 質疑上訴方以爭取普選來合理化否決財案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;律政司代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行回應昨日上訴方有關法律議題的陳詞。周指，上訴方嘗試以他們的方式重構控方案情，然而控方實際上並不是指稱被告拒絕審視財案利弊優劣，而是指稱不論財政預算案的內容或優劣，被告均打算「無差別」否決，明顯地是違背了《基本法》第73條所定下的職權，構成濫權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周續指，上訴方似乎利用《基本法》承諾達至普選，來合理化被告否決財案的行為，然而這只是轉移視線（red herring）。因《基本法》附件一及二已列出行政長官和立法會的產生辦法，指引香港特區如何達到「雙普選」；《基本法》清晰地列出立法會的職能和權力，以及當財案被否決後、不同情況下應採取什麼做法及怎樣運用權力，是為了應對不同的處境，不代表議員有權否決財案便可以「為所欲為」；周反指他們應該跟從《基本法》所定下的框架。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周亦提到，上訴方指稱立法會可以拒絕通過財案，以迫使特首辭職，是另一個荒謬的例子，亦吻合他們濫權的說法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;律政司司法不應干預立法會的法律原則並非絕對不適用本案&quot;&gt;律政司：司法不應干預立法會的法律原則並非絕對、不適用本案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周指，上訴方昨提及司法不應干預立法會行使權力的法律原則，並非絕對，而且不適用於本案。原審法官已在裁決理由書中充份及正確地處理有關議題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周亦指，上訴方提交的海外案例，對於本案的協助有限，因海外的案例並不能處理《基本法》和《國安法》之下香港特有的法律框架，也削弱了「應在憲法框架下行使權力」的概念。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;律政司顛覆國家政權條文下非法手段並不僅限於刑事行為&quot;&gt;律政司：顛覆國家政權條文下「非法手段」並不僅限於「刑事行為」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;上訴方昨日堅稱《國安法》第22條涉及「顛覆國家政權」罪行條文中，「以武力、威脅使用武力或者其他非法手段」中的「非法手段（unlawful means）」，必然意指「刑事行為（criminal acts）」。周天行則反駁指，若然「非法手段」僅限於「刑事行為」的話，只會使「或者其他非法手段」字眼變得多餘（otiose），沒有任何實質意義。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行指，原審法官在裁決中已正確地指出「非法手段」並不僅限於「刑事行為」或牽涉武力，相反「非法手段」還可以包括任何法律上不容許的手段，解讀時須視乎條文的上文下理和立法目的，而且法庭考慮條文的上文下理時應採取較廣闊的理解。周又指，原審裁決理由書中乃比對了《國安法》下其他條文的用字，例如「通過各種非法方式引發⋯⋯憎恨並可能造成嚴重後果」、「其他危險方法」，從而得出結論，又指草擬《國安法》的人士使用「非法手段」字眼，在用字方面是故意，為了包涵各式各樣的手段。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;上訴方基本法未有規定議員怎樣運用權力&quot;&gt;上訴方：《基本法》未有規定議員怎樣運用權力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表黃碧雲和林卓廷的大律師沈士文回應指，《基本法》並未有規定議員怎樣運用權力，舉例指沒有限制議員發言時間，反問議員行使權力否決財案的背後理由，是否應受到法庭審視？答案是否定，按照「不干預」的原則，法庭不應插手有關議題，否則的話，議員行使權力的方式可被刑事化，後果是非常嚴重和影響深遠。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對於律政司一方指稱上訴人以普選來合理化否決財案的行為，只是轉移視線，沈士文表示不同意，因《基本法》附件並非「答案」，雖然《基本法》第68條表明香港會達至立法會由普選產生，可是社會上對於普選路線圖仍存在很多分歧和爭議。沈士文最後重申，《基本法》設下的機制是為了處理立法會的「死局」，並不會在法律上構成「顛覆政權」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;吳政亨贊同35計劃不代表贊同無差別否決財案&quot;&gt;吳政亨：贊同「35+」計劃不代表贊同「無差別」否決財案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;接著上訴方就各人的案情陳詞。代表吳政亨的大律師關文渭指，吳與首被告戴耀廷之間從沒有就否決財政預算案有任何討論。關強調，吳贊同「35+」計劃並不代表他同樣贊同「無差別」否決財案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/JR7EKAR.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 吳政亨&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關又指，戴耀廷有可能與不同的參選人達成不同的協議，而且不同參選人可能出席了不同地區的協調會議，收到不同的會議文件，因此戴與吳之間可能達成了的協議，是不同於戴與其他參選人之間的協議。關強調，舉辦初選乃至在立會奪取大多數議席並無問題，這可能是戴與吳之間的協議，吳不應因而被定罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄭達鴻從沒主張無差別否決財案-原審法庭未充份考慮不會跟黨投票&quot;&gt;鄭達鴻：從沒主張「無差別」否決財案 原審法庭未充份考慮不會跟黨投票&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表鄭達鴻的資深大律師潘熙指，有關在協調會議文件上應該使用「會積極運用」還是「會運用」《基本法》權力，初選參與者之間從沒達成共識，尤其是在鄭達鴻所屬的港島區，因此犯罪計劃並不存在，惟原審法庭未有予以充份考慮，犯了錯誤。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙續指，即使犯罪計劃確實存在，鄭達鴻也不是犯罪計劃的一份子，因當時鄭是公民黨裡相對年輕的黨員，是「小人物（small potato）」，不像較資深的黨員般有決策權，即使鄭的想法與黨不一致，但他也沒有權去控制或「話事」。鄭當時願意跟隨公民黨否決財案的路線，是為了得到黨的支持而參選初選和其後的立法會選舉，這與他一旦當選後會否按自己意願還是「跟黨投票」並不相同，惟原審法庭未有區分兩者之間的分別。潘又指，原審法庭未有對鄭與黨之間想法上的分歧給予充份比重。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/l6NRfQa.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
▲ 鄭達鴻（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘續指，鄭本人抱持著希望，相信政府會回應市民訴求，例如政府的確撤回了《逃犯條例》修訂，某程度上回應了「五大訴求」之一，因此鄭相信，若然財案被否決的話，政府會與他們對話，強調鄭從沒主張「無差別」否決財案，反而是經考慮利弊之後才決定投票贊成還是反對。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘又指，原審法官未有考慮鄭達鴻與其他黨友的言論有別，也未有考慮鄭曾經自行研究過《基本法》；若果鄭相信自己的行為並不會癱瘓政府運作，法庭便不能推論他懷有「顛覆」意圖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;梁國雄過去曾考慮基層政策而投反對票-非為否決而否決&quot;&gt;梁國雄：過去曾考慮基層政策而投反對票 非「為否決而否決」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙接著代表梁國雄陳詞，他指由於梁未有親自作供，原審法官在裁決理由書中，僅用了11個段落便裁定梁罪成。潘指梁從沒參與任何討論或出席任何初選協調會議，僅派出代表出席會議。區諾軒的證供更顯示，同屬社民連的黃浩銘曾提醒區：「陣間開會，唔好應承人哋會否決財政預算案嘅講法」；岑子杰亦曾在會議上表明，若果財政預算案包含全民退休保障的話，社民連會投贊成票。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘指，梁國雄從不支持「攬炒」概念，惟原審裁決引述社民連在2020年5月所發布的文章〈爭奪全面否決權持續不斷抗暴政 — 社會民主連線回應當前香港政治形勢變化的決議文〉，指稱他們立場轉變，即是轉為支持奪取大多數議席以行使否決權。潘則反駁，該文章並不足以證明他們立場由不支持變為支持「無差別」否決財案，因社民連一直以來均以「改善基層及勞動市民生活為先」，所以不會「無差別」否決財案。若果法庭接納黃浩銘和陳寶瑩代表社民連在會議上的言論，那麼梁國雄便沒有打算「無差別」否決財案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙指，早在案發之前，擔任立法會議員的梁國雄亦曾經對財案投過反對票，因為他認為財案未有包含全民退休保障或任何幫助基層的措施，又或者梁認為有關財政預算屬「不義撥款」，因而投下反對票。潘強調，梁並非「為否決而否決」，而是考慮過財案利弊才決定投什麼票。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊雪盈從無在fb發布墨落無悔帖文&quot;&gt;楊雪盈：從無在FB發布「墨落無悔」帖文&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表楊雪盈的大律師張耀良陳詞指，楊在案中屬最低參與程度，她的名字出現在「墨落無悔」聲明帖文上的其他聯署人之中，可是她從未在 Facebook 發布「墨落無悔」帖文，沒有證據顯示誰人加入楊的名字，「這是一個謎」；然而原審裁決指唯一合理推論是她知悉「墨落無悔」的內容，同意及有意推動涉案謀劃，屬犯了嚴重錯誤。張反指，有可能把楊的名字加入聯署者名單是另有其人，可是案中沒有任何證據。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6zheeQ5.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
▲ 楊雪盈&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張續指，楊雪盈的宣傳小冊子列出她的9項政治主張，涵蓋動物權益、環保、性小眾和社區發展等，而「五大訴求」僅為其中之一，顯示楊是一名特立獨行的政治人物，較有興趣涉足社會服務，而不會視自己為民主派，因此她對於跟隨戴耀廷的計劃不感興趣。張並舉例指，楊沒有親自出席第一次的協調會議，只是派出一名代表，惟原審法官忽視第一次協調會議並有未達成共識否決財案，第二及第三次會議則只談及流程，因此原審裁定楊對否決財案計劃知情，必然是不符事實。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張耀良亦指，原審法官考慮了不相關的證據，包括警方在楊的辦公室電腦搜獲的一份草擬文件，當中提及她「一定會否決」預算案。張指該文件從沒有公開發布、沒有轉發給其他人，當警方發現該文件時，楊幾乎忘記了有這樣的文件，沒有證據顯示楊在選舉工程中使用過它。張堅稱，該文件所載的只是「選舉語言」，質疑原審法官不應斷定該文件是楊為初選準備的「統一口徑（lines to take）」或選舉論壇筆記，從而裁定楊有罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張總結指，楊表示會否決財案，只是因為財政預算案向有錢人傾側，未能惠及真正有需要的市民，電腦搜獲的文件亦未能顯示楊會聯同其他民主派一起「無差別」否決財案。張並強調楊有自己的政治主張。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳志全作為最勤力議員-不會一反常態不再擁護基本法和特區政府&quot;&gt;陳志全：作為最勤力議員 不會一反常態不再擁護《基本法》和特區政府&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表何啟明的大律師馬維騉指，何僅就法律議題上訴，沒有任何補充。馬維騉另代表陳志全，指陳當時任職立法會議員，因出席率達99%而被讚為最勤力議員，甚至獲時任立法會主席讚賞。陳當時熟悉公共事務，並且必然知悉《基本法》第50至53條下，特首解散立法會的權力，以及重選後若然立法會第二度否決財案的話，特首便須辭職，以及《基本法》第73條列明的立法會議員職能，這是毋庸置疑的。因此，陳是否有干犯「顛覆國家政權」罪的傾向，便有商榷之處。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ctxqpSO.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
▲ 何啟明（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬指，陳從沒有在選舉論壇、網台節目或遊行期間，提及過會「無差別」否決財政預算案。相反，陳過去曾與親建制派合作，支持政府政策。馬反問，陳作為一名宣誓效忠《基本法》和特區政府的時任立法會議員，他有意圖「無差別」否決財案、癱瘓政府運作，是否唯一不可抗拒的推論？馬質疑，原審法官未有對陳的證供給予充份比重，反而考慮控方證據，指稱陳突然一反常態，不再擁護《基本法》和特區政府，這是否一個公平的推論？馬質疑法庭不能達致唯一不可抗拒的推論，陳的定罪並不穩妥。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;林卓廷從沒主張無差別否決-曾表明若政府派錢便不會反對財案&quot;&gt;林卓廷：從沒主張「無差別」否決 曾表明若政府「派錢」便不會反對財案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表黃碧雲和林卓廷的大律師沈士文則陳詞指，雖然警方在林卓廷的住所搜到論壇筆記，當中提及他附和胡志偉否決財案的主意，但是林從沒有在論壇上採用這份筆記所述的主意，更反而表明若然政府在財政預算案中包含「派錢」措施的話，便不會投反對票。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈又指，黃和林從沒有主張「無差別」否決財案，也沒有出席過初選協調會議，只是派出黨友莊榮輝作為代表，可見二人並不感興趣，因此沒有證據顯示二人在會上聽過戴耀廷講述涉案計劃，二人並不知情。再者，根據第一控方證人區諾軒的證供，沒有任何一個協調會議曾達成共識同意「無差別」否決財案，與會者的共識從來只限於舉辦初選論壇、爭取的議席數目和替補機制等。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 黃碧雲（左）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈指，二人的行為並不構成顛覆政權，惟原審法官混淆了案中事實，並構建定罪的理由，而非著眼真正的議題。沈又提及，有的初選參與者同樣來自民主黨，卻未有被起訴相同控罪，其中一個例子是鄺俊宇。事實上，鄺在初選論壇中曾公開說過與林卓廷類似的言論，表示若然財政預算案有好處的話便不會投反對票。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審，沈會繼續代表黃和林陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

Foreign ship construction can rapidly deliver the needed icebreakers as the U.S. grows its domestic shipbuilding industry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has an ongoing and growing national security risk in the Arctic. Due to the lack of U.S. presence in the region, the country is unable to sufficiently counter, or even fully understand, this risk. While Russia’s over 40 polar icebreakers, compared to the United States’ current three (with only one a true heavy polar icebreaker) may seem like a glaring disparity, China’s four icebreakers (with a fifth on the way) are arguably more distressing. A direct comparison of icebreaker numbers with Russia is not a fair measure, because Russia has different operational demands in the Arctic (e.g., more ports, waterways, and Arctic area for their icebreakers to service). However, China is not an Arctic nation, and currently has more polar icebreakers than the United States—and is likely to continue outpacing the United States’ sluggish icebreaker construction effort. This constitutes a giant spotlight on the U.S. national security risk in the Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) polar icebreaker acquisition challenges are well known, having been the subject of several recent congressional hearings, multiple articles, and a comment recently made by President Trump about ordering 40 big icebreakers. The USCG’s then–deputy commandant for operations, Vice Admiral Peter Gautier, and then–deputy commandant for mission support, Vice Admiral Thomas Allan Jr., testified before the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on November 14, 2024, on the USCG’s icebreaker recapitalization efforts. Those testimonies affirmed the U.S. national security risk in the Arctic, the USCG’s need for more ice breaking capacity now, and the sad state of the Polar Security Cutter (PSC) acquisition program. The continued PSC acquisition challenges were further acknowledged again by Vice Admiral Allan Jr.’s testimonies before the House Committee on Homeland Security on December 18, 2024, and the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on March 5, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States is fully aware of the growing national security risk in the Arctic: President Trump announced the creation of a White House Office of Shipbuilding in his 2025 State of the Union address and addressed the problem further in his recent executive order, Restoring America’s Maritime Dominance. But the PSC solution remains a distant reality. The USCG was unable to provide a date for delivery of the first PSC when the subject was raised during the recent hearings; 2033 was mentioned by Representative Rick Larsen during the March 5 hearing. But estimates have continued to slide for years, and the 2033 date must be eyed with skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contract for the first PSC was announced in 2019 with a planned delivery in 2024. That date has passed, and the first PSC is still being designed (albeit nearing completion) and the shipbuilder and USCG do not have enough understanding of the totality of the project to provide a delivery estimate with any level of confidence. This is especially distressing as the three-ship PSC acquisition cost has ballooned almost threefold from $1.9 billion to an estimated $5.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-origins-of-the-problem&quot;&gt;The Origins of the Problem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PSC is a large, complicated ship, and the U.S. shipbuilding industry has not constructed a heavy icebreaker in 50 years. The reasons for the PSC being delayed and over budget are many, and they are all justifiable to a certain degree. Responsibility for the problems ends up being a circular argument where all stakeholders share portions of the blame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One major overarching problem with all federal ship acquisitions is that they are sluggish, even in the best of circumstances. The laws and regulations governing major system acquisition programs are partly to blame, and are being targeted for reform by President Trump’s recent Modernizing Defense Acquisitions and Spurring Innovation in the Defense Industrial Base executive order. It takes years to amass all the written analyses, reports, and documents to support the acquisition of a major system. Ten years is used as the USCG’s general planning factor when starting a new cutter acquisition—that is about how long it takes to run the acquisition gamut between identifying a future capability gap to taking delivery of the first new cutter when all goes smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking the USCG’s Fast Response Cutter (FRC) acquisition as an example, the USCG documented the need to recapitalize their aging fleet of 110-ft patrol boats in a 1995 Mission Analysis Report and commenced the ignominious Integrated Deepwater System program in 1996 to comprehensively recapitalize its aged fleet of cutters, aircraft, and boats. After several fits and starts, the FRC program contract was awarded in its current state in 2008 and the USCG took delivery of the first FRC hull in early 2012. That is 17 years from documented need to delivery of the first hull, a distressingly long time for a class of cutters that is relatively simple and small, and that ultimately utilized an off-the-shelf design. The FRC acquisition demonstrates that even a 10-year planning timeline can be ambitious for a major system acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of what is possible across the global shipbuilding industry from a construction perspective, take the Royal Caribbean’s Icon of the Seas cruise ship as an example. The contract for the Icon of the Seas was announced in 2016, construction began in June of 2021, and the ship was completed and departed on its first voyage in January 2024—less than three years later. Acknowledging the apples to oranges comparison, the Icon of the Seas is arguably more complicated than the PSC—the PSC has no waterparks, mini-golf courses, or ice rinks, and will accommodate roughly 7,000 fewer people. If a ship the size and complexity of the Icon of the Seas can be brought into operation in a matter of years, why not a heavy polar icebreaker?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be a miracle if the USCG took delivery of the first PSC before the end of the decade and lucky if a 2033 delivery comes through. If that is unacceptable to the administration and Congress, something must change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-current-state-of-uscg-polar-icebreakers&quot;&gt;The Current State of USCG Polar Icebreakers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The USCG operates the national fleet of active Polar icebreaking ships (cutters), including one heavy icebreaker, USCG Cutter (USCGC) Polar Star, and two medium icebreakers, USCGC Healy and the recently acquired USCGC Storis. Both the Polar Star and Healy are noble cutters and have served the nation admirably, but they are old (49 years and 25 years, respectively) and overdue for replacement. The USCG is largely succeeding in keeping their two legacy polar icebreakers operational by putting their operations and maintenance into “no-fail” status; essentially, they get 100 percent of needed funding. Ideally, all cutters would get 100 percent funding, but the USCG is only completing half of needed cutter maintenance due to funding shortfalls and competing demands. These constraints have outsized negative impacts to the readiness, safety, and effectiveness of the other 240 cutters in the fleet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the USCG spending an outsized portion of its cutter operations and sustainment budget on its polar icebreakers, it has struggled to keep them running. Healy’s equipment casualty in July 2024 called its annual deployment into question. This follows the significant fire in 2020 that necessitated a complex and lengthy replacement of one of its main propulsion motors. Keeping Polar Star running relies on cannibalizing parts from the inactive Polar Sea—a clear indication that the USCG’s sole heavy polar icebreaker and its maintenance program are far from state-of-the-art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The acquisition of the former offshore supply vessel Aiviq from Edison Chouest Offshore, renamed the USCGC Storis, will certainly help the USCG provide additional presence in the Arctic. However, there are valid reasons why the USCG balked at the Aiviq when discussion around potentially leasing the ship started in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The delays in acquiring PSCs forced the USCG to embrace the Aiviq with open if wary arms. Because the Storis was designed and built for different operations than what the USCG intends to use it for, the USCG will attempt to secure appropriations to put the Storis through significant and expensive bouts of retrofits and design changes—including modifications and equipage to comply with damage control, survivability, and cybersecurity policies—to improve the vessel’s ability to perform USCG missions in the polar ice. To focus the Storis’ patrolling effort as soon and as often as possible in the Arctic, these retrofit periods must be shoehorned between regular deployments. Stopping and starting maintenance of that magnitude is typically undesirable due to repeated work shutdowns and startups that add time and cost to the overall project and reduce the time the cutter is available for the crew to operate and train on. However, doing so is necessary in this case to deliver the immediate and recurrent presence in the Arctic that Congress demands. The cutter is expected to perform well and to improve with each successive modification cycle. However, the Storis will forever suffer from issues associated with the design and configuration modifications and it will always be a single-class ship, which will present challenges and added costs for the life of the cutter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Trump’s June 2020 Memorandum on Safeguarding U.S. National Interests in the Arctic and Antarctic Regions directed the analysis of partner-nation icebreaker leasing options and his comment on June 25, 2025, during a NATO Summit press conference about buying a used icebreaker from Finland indicated continued interest in acquiring available foreign icebreakers. Buying or leasing foreign icebreakers could certainly increase the USCG’s presence in the Arctic, but these foreign icebreakers would suffer many of the same capability shortcomings inherent in the Storis. Purchasing a foreign icebreaker would necessitate costly modifications like those planned for the Storis. For a leased ship, it is unlikely that capability shortcomings could be meaningfully ameliorated with modifications given the nature of a lease; the USCG would have to return it in the same state they received it. Leasing contract renewals and the availability of the ships for deployments may not be guaranteed; and the ships may not be available outside of deployments for crew training to build operating proficiency. Some legislative gymnastics would likely be required to even get a foreign vessel purchase or lease on the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The risks to national security in the Arctic are urgent and growing and demand immediate attention. To address these risks, the USCG has identified a need for a mix of eight to nine heavy and medium polar icebreakers. Generally, heavy polar icebreakers are large ships that would enable the exquisite capability of year-round access to polar regions while medium polar icebreakers are comparatively smaller, have a shallower draft and less endurance, and less acquisition and sustainment costs. They will operate in shallower, ice-covered coastal areas where the majority of typical USCG mission demand in the Arctic is expected to occur. As previously discussed, the three-ship PSC program is delayed and overbudget. The planned USCG medium polar icebreaker acquisition program is named the Arctic Security Cutter (ASC) and currently has nothing to show for itself beyond its name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-way-ahead&quot;&gt;The Way Ahead&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent developments indicate a positive sea change on the horizon for the USCG’s polar icebreaker acquisition programs. Only July 4, 2025, President Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act into law, marking a huge windfall for USCG icebreaking acquisition programs. The bill appropriates the USCG $4.3 billion for the PSC program and $3.5 billion for the bourgeoning Arctic Security Cutter (ASC) medium polar icebreaker program. The appropriations will go a long way to helping make the PSCs and ASCs a reality, but funding does not guarantee the U.S. shipbuilding industry can construct and deliver either class of ship in a timely fashion on budget and on schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April 2025, the USCG issued a Request for Information (RFI) to industry to identify medium polar icebreaking ship designs for the ASC acquisition program that are complete or already in operation and global shipyards able to launch a medium polar icebreaker within 36 months of the contract being awarded. Seeking information from global shipyards is a significant development and is a clear indication that foreign ship construction may be on the table. Note, though, that the RFI seeks the ability to launch rather than deliver a ship within 36 months. A ship can be launched with potentially years’ worth of construction and outfitting yet to go. Because rapid operational deployment is desired and international shipyards have demonstrated the ability to deliver polar icebreakers the size of an ASC within 36 months, the USCG should instead use delivery timing as the desired performance measure. Otherwise, the USCG may find itself in a situation where an unproven shipyard is able to float the hull within 36 months, only to have the overall project flounder in the familiar ruts for years before delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fastest way the U.S. can acquire needed polar icebreakers is through foreign icebreaker construction. Yes, foreign ship construction is currently unacceptable for a variety of very good reasons, including compliance with current U.S. law, but it is possible if the U.S. is willing to make it happen. The spectrum of potential foreign involvement in U.S. ship construction spans from simple collaboration and information sharing through full ship delivery. Assuming two foreign shipyards are available to take on the work, a rough best-case scenario calculation is that the U.S. could potentially take delivery of four ASCs and have two of them in full operation by 2030. That is well before the likely delivery of the first PSC and before the USCG is able to make all of its planned annual iterative upgrades to the Storis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several steps Congress and the USCG can take to put the ASC program into action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congress should take the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Allow the USCG to bypass the traditional acquisitions process and go straight to a readily available solution—an existing medium polar icebreaker warship design in current operation, such as the Royal Canadian Navy’s Harry DeWolf–class offshore patrol vessel. This would enable an immediate start to construction, eliminating years’ worth of time devoted to establishing requirements; advertising, bidding, and awarding the contract; and vessel design. Program risk would be reduced through evidence of successful operation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Construct the ASCs in Canada and/or Finland (perhaps preferred, given alignment with the Icebreaker Collaboration Effort (ICE) Pact) and/or by other foreign partner nations. Negotiate a fair market price and commence construction immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do not allow “analysis paralysis,” aspirational requirements, or significant design changes to slow the process. Put the acquisition reforms and innovation directed by the recent executive order into action.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Construct five ASCs of the USCG’s advertised icebreaker fleet mix of eight to nine heavy and medium polar icebreakers.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Construct the ASCs in whatever foreign shipyards can accommodate their fastest delivery. Preference could be given to Canada and Finland to capitalize on ICE Pact collaboration, but other foreign partner shipyards should not be excluded from competition on a fastest ship delivery performance basis.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eliminate as many major system acquisition requirements and documents as possible. Allow completion of the most useful documents concurrently with the ships’ construction.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Continue with long-term planning and programs to bolster the United States’ shipbuilding and maritime industrial base, such as those proposed by the Congressional Guidance for a National Maritime Strategy and the Shipbuilding and Harbor Infrastructure for Prosperity and Security (SHIPS) for America Act, and initiatives championed by the White House Office of Shipbuilding and directed by executive orders.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Allow the PSC program to continue, despite the delays and cost overruns, and the requirement that it be reviewed for cancellation pursuant to section six of the recent acquisition modernization executive order. The $4.3 billion appropriated by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act should hopefully be sufficient to get the three ships completed. The PSC program and U.S. shipbuilding industry succeeding would be a point of pride for the U.S. and would help demonstrate the promised value of the ICE Pact, and the money invested would help strengthen and grow the U.S. maritime industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The USCG should undertake the following recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Partner with U.S. industry for supporting equipment contracts for systems like the command, control, communications, computers, cyber, and intelligence (C5I) suite, weapons systems, small boats, and deck equipment (e.g., davits, cranes, and windlasses). Plan to conduct final ship outfits of all ASCs in a U.S. shipyard.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While low on icebreaker capacity, and at little-to-no cost, the USCG should seek opportunities to partner with foreign navies and coast guards active in the polar regions through reciprocal professional exchanges of personnel, shiprider maritime law enforcement agreements, and deployments of law enforcement detachments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States will not increase its icebreaker numbers by the end of the decade under the current acquisition plan. Foreign construction of USCG ASCs would be novel and would uncomfortably highlight the shortcomings of the U.S. shipbuilding industrial base, but could add four much-needed ASCs to the USCG fleet by the end of the decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The forthcoming UK Cyber and Electromagnetic Command (CyberEM) outlined in the Strategic Defence Review could be a much-needed pillar of modernisation. It follows a line of thinking, pre-dating Russia’s 2022 Ukraine invasion, where electronic warfare (characterised by rigid hardware) and cyber operations are increasingly entwined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the past is a guide, we have a long way to go. Four years ago, Future Soldier promised to boost the Army’s electronic warfare (EW) capability “100%”, while UK doctrine from 2018 highlights the “imperative” to master the “convergence” of cyber and electromagnetic activities (CEMA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has not translated into reality, either in equipment or training. A well-identified problem is a lack of digital skills not only in the MOD but across the defence industry. Plans to address this may not be bold enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s CEMA lessons pose worrying questions for the command if the British Army faced a “fight tonight” scenario. The problem is attracting talent while upskilling CEMA personnel in the Army – which could lose operators to “the domain lead”, CyberEM Command. For this new vision, the pipeline for specialists is thin, with 32 scheduled for training at Shrivenham this year. For context, 13 Signal Regiment was re-formed around a core of roughly 250 specialists. For the new “cyber pipeline” at Shrivenham, “recruitment into cyber roles in 2025 will initially be through the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force, with the British Army joining for subsequent recruitment campaigns from early 2026.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CyberEM Command will deploy contractors to conflicts as a Digital Warfighter Group alongside soldiers. Bolstering Army generalist ability and specialisation in this field has been identified as a serious near-term problem, so it is vital that this fundamental requirement is not lost amid reorganisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does this matter? Soldiers must be, at a minimum, aware that the moment of a cyberattack, from disrupting rail transit to the Baltics to a glitch in a wide area network, could preclude kinetic effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Unmanned Aerial Systems, deployed in swarms to stream intelligence to commanders, can be hacked “over the air.” UAS cyber exploitation can be avoided with vigilance, but it is an evolving risk. The US is now interested in cyber payloads delivered in radio frequency attacks, degrading or compromising battle networks, and how to defend against this. This capability has long existed in the air domain and was seen in Ukraine when Russian hackers Fancy Bear compromised an early version of a Ukrainian app for artillery in the Donbas – with lethal effect – while Ukraine’s Delta system has been repeatedly targeted. Our networks will hopefully be more robust, but our adversaries will be more capable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many cyber activities will be conducted far from the front, much of it by civilian contractors, and CEMA equipment is increasingly user friendly, there is wide agreement that specialists will be in high demand for expeditionary operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is because “software-defined warfare” relies on increasing amounts of deployed hardware, such as the Trinity Wide Area network nodes that could be fitted to Boxer armoured vehicles as part of the Digital Targeting Web (DTW).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Low latency of these networks cannot be assumed. US Marines have reported many hours of struggle coordinating with contractors working in shifts at far away hubs while deploying battlefield networks. In a peer conflict, Royal Signals personnel will be working around the clock on the engineering and cyber side of operations to maintain communications as forces move. Meanwhile, even ruggedised computers can fail in austere environments. The deployable Digital Warfighter Group is logical, but we need more army specialists, not just “button pushers”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In communications, technology is opening doors. CEMA is increasingly implemented through reprogrammable digital systems while software-defined radios “hop” frequencies 1000s of times a second and spread signals across the spectrum to thwart interception and jamming. CEMA equipment is getting more portable, powerful and “cognitive”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effort now is to fuse a vast array of new and emerging systems and tactics on an extremely short timeline, including replacing obsolete equipment like the Bowman radio, if Britain is to stand up its DTW by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;orchestrating-the-cyber-domain&quot;&gt;Orchestrating the Cyber Domain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CyberEM Command therefore has an important “cohering” role, discussed in the SDR. An increasing number of compact EW systems can be mounted on manned aircraft, drones or ground vehicles to disrupt attacks through deception, attack (to blind adversaries) or a combination of EW and kinetic effects, passively seeking and destroying radars and GPS jammers. However, tactics constantly evolve and opponents can modify antennas to harden against jamming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SDR describes the need for “the Integrated Force to fuse the disparate CyberEM activity of a small number of expert organisations” and that the CyberEM Command would be the “single point of authority”. The SDR says that “where cyber effects must be aligned as part of military operations, this integration will remain the responsibility of the relevant joint commander”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What might alignment involve? Under Project ASGARD, which focuses on reconnaissance and strike, the Army is procuring drones from Modini. Their Dart 250 EW has a passive sensor to seek enemy radars, potentially complementing the RAF Stormshroud which has a software-defined payload that creates false radar returns. This could enable Joint Suppression and Destruction of Enemy Air Defences (JSEAD/DEAD) to create overlapping effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this increasingly complex battlefield, a liaison role for CyberEM Command will allow centralised “decision making for authorities to reduce duplication and reduce inefficiency”. It will be critical to track new multidomain systems and tactics. For example, the DIGAR anti-GNSS jamming platform was originally intended for manned aircraft but was reconfigured for use in Ukraine, hardening HIMARS against Russian GNSS jamming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These examples show the need for wider “spectrum awareness” across the force, and the potential it could unlock. But before CyberEM Command can “cohere” and “align” we need enough Army specialists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-cyberem-startup&quot;&gt;The CyberEM Startup&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CyberEM is intended to aid how “defence understands, develops and accesses capability with allies and industry”. Civilian contractors will play a core role in the DTW, requiring highly motivated talent, including experts in encryption and AI from the private sector and reservists in the Specialist Group Information Services. A “Spectrum Coordination Office” will support civil-military cooperation to this end, but realising this goal may come down to attracting talent in-house, as much as partnering with industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasingly, AI will be incorporated into our systems. The Command’s Cyber Direct Entry programme offers applicants £40,000 starting salary with £25,000 “in additional skills pay”. This is a good start - according to Glassdoor, the average salary for a cyber security specialist in London is £51,000, however according to the LSE, the median advertised salary for AI engineers in the capital is £87,500.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need for specialists sits uneasily with the tight timeline for the DTW: Trinity is due to replace the Falcon internet system next year. The Boxer, potentially fitted with Trinity, may not be ready in meaningful numbers. We may also be moving to the ability to reprogram equipment for almost any enemy EMS tactic in near real time, through US experimental projects such as the Rapid Effects Generation Enterprise and Arsenal. This is implemented at the battlefield tactical edge, not remotely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eighteen years after the first publicly reported cyber-EMS attack, Israel’s strike on an incomplete nuclear reactor in Syria (thought to be a joint operation between the Israeli Air Force and Unit 8200) the UK is finally close to a CEMA strategy fit for modern war. It comes, by some accounts, after decades where the Army has fallen behind on EW capabilities. We cannot afford similar delays on the rapidly changing modern battlefield. For CyberEM Command to truly fulfil its role, it needs to be properly resourced, for training capacity, staff retention and career development opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once confined to science fiction, solar geoengineering is now moving into real-world experimentation, raising the risk of misuse by hostile actors. Also known as solar radiation management, this set of novel technologies – such as stratospheric aerosol injection and marine cloud brightening – aims to artificially slow the rise in global temperatures by reducing the amount of sunlight absorbed by the Earth’s surface. To date, their primary purpose has been to tackle the symptoms of accelerating climate change. However, these technologies also pose dual-use risks: alongside unintended environmental consequences, they could be exploited by powers seeking to tilt the geopolitical balance to cause climate-related disruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the UK government prioritises investment in solar geoengineering research and development, it has a crucial window to help shape international norms. Without adequate safeguards, these technologies could become tools of geopolitical coercion in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russias-campaign-of-hybrid-warfare-in-europe-is-expanding&quot;&gt;Russia’s Campaign of Hybrid Warfare in Europe is Expanding&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK’s new national security strategy, released on 24 June, highlights a rise in hostile activity on British soil from countries like Russia and Iran. This includes acts of sabotage, cyber attacks and other forms of democratic interference, which often exploit legal loopholes and are difficult for the authorities to attribute. The strategy warns that such hybrid threats not only endanger the British people but also threaten the UK’s critical national infrastructure and prosperity. This trend, the authors suggest, will continue over the coming years as states pursue their interests more assertively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A growing consensus among European governments and their intelligence communities indicates that Russia, in particular, is escalating its clandestine activities across the region, necessitating increased governmental preparedness and response. In November 2024, MI6 Chief Sir Richard Moore publicly revealed that the UK’s intelligence services had uncovered a “staggeringly reckless campaign” of Russian sabotage in Europe. Similarly, Norway’s national security strategy, released in May, identified Russian sabotage as a major concern, emphasising the need to anticipate more aggressive and widespread hostile actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A report on Russian targeting patterns and tactics, published in February (which this author contributed to), shows that Russia’s campaign of hybrid activities in Europe has expanded significantly since Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began over three years ago. It documents over 200 incidents of suspected Russian hybrid warfare in Europe between 2014 and 2024, including acts of sabotage, disinformation and electromagnetic attacks like GPS jamming. Most incidents (86%) have taken place since early 2022, with events recorded in 2024 rising sixfold compared to the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s choice of targets has also evolved. In addition to arson attacks on ammunition depots, Moscow has increasingly targeted the energy and aviation sectors, severing undersea power cables and planting incendiary devices on air freight. The number of European countries targeted by Russian hybrid warfare has also surged. This same report shows that an average of 20 countries were targeted annually in 2022-24, up from just three per year in the prior three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Baltic states, Finland, Germany, Norway, Poland and the UK have remained the primary targets so far this year, probably due to their continued support for Kyiv. In the first half of 2025, suspected Russian operations have included conducting undersea infrastructure surveillance off the British coast, distributing fake military draft letters to Ukrainians living in Poland, and damaging a water supply system on Sweden’s Gotland Island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these actions appear designed to test European defences and probe for weaknesses. But others seem more random, suggesting that Moscow’s goal is not only to prepare for a possible future involving a direct military confrontation with NATO, but to create a sense of confusion and chaos. By wreaking havoc across Europe, the Kremlin likely aims to force European states to focus their attention inwards, divert European resources from Ukraine and show that sanctions enforcement carries political and economic costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response, European states are stepping up efforts to deter hybrid threats. This has included criminal proceedings, diplomatic expulsions and strengthening cyber defences. NATO’s Baltic Sentry mission, launched earlier this year, also aims to increase surveillance of critical undersea cables in the Baltic Sea and shows promise in preventing future incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet as measures to counter Russian sabotage mature, the Kremlin may further diversify its tactics. Although unlikely in the short term, an expanded hybrid warfare campaign could involve even more elaborate approaches. At the more imaginative end of the spectrum, this may include causing an environmental disaster, like an oil spill in a busy maritime shipping lane. Alternatively, Moscow could seek to induce climate extremes, such as drought or flooding, by deploying solar geoengineering technologies against an adversary, disrupting agricultural production and the operation of critical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;solar-geoengineering-research-sees-renewed-support&quot;&gt;Solar Geoengineering Research Sees Renewed Support&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International intrigue in climate cooling technologies is growing. The UK government’s Advanced Research and Invention Agency, for example, announced in May plans to invest £57 million across 21 geoengineering projects. This includes funds for stratospheric aerosol injection research and efforts to refreeze Arctic Sea ice, which is now shrinking at a rate of 12.2% per decade due to global warming, compared to its average extent during the period from 1981 to 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These investments make the UK one of the largest funders of geoengineering research globally. But it is not the only state interested in assessing the feasibility of these emerging technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several others, including Australia, China, India, Russia, the US, and several EU members, are also exploring geoengineering techniques. This is according to the US intelligence community’s national intelligence estimate on the geopolitical implications of climate change through 2040. This report, published in 2021 during the Biden administration, warned that large-scale unilateral solar geoengineering deployment by a major power to counter the intensifying effects of climate change, should other warming-limitation efforts be deemed insufficient, would carry major risks for geopolitical stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian scientists have long been strong proponents of solar geoengineering for managing climate change impacts. According to one recent academic study, this interest stretches back to the mid-Soviet period. Notably, Moscow had remained an important voice in this scientific debate until its isolation from the international science scene following its invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;security-concerns-around-solar-geoengineering-abound&quot;&gt;Security Concerns Around Solar Geoengineering Abound&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climate scientists have long held diverging views on whether more research funding should be channelled into solar geoengineering. This is partly because research and deployment of these technologies are not currently covered by existing international law, despite their potential for harmful cross-border impacts. While some states have agreed to a de facto moratorium on large-scale solar geoengineering use under the Convention on Biological Diversity, a UN treaty focused on protecting biodiversity, this agreement is not legally binding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With relatively few field experiments having been carried out, solar geoengineering technologies remain largely unproven. Meanwhile, the interconnected nature of the global climate system makes unintended consequences resulting from their use highly likely. The UN and various research institutes have in recent years highlighted the risk of potential side-effects, including unpredictable and extreme changes in rainfall patterns, which could undermine food and water security within affected areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key concern is how any cascading effects would manifest. As previous analysis on this issue has suggested, increased rainfall that is beneficial to one country might cause major downstream flooding in a neighbouring state. While any sudden termination of these technologies would risk triggering severe shocks, including abrupt warming and ecosystem disruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;solar-geoengineering-as-an-instrument-of-hybrid-warfare&quot;&gt;Solar Geoengineering as an Instrument of Hybrid Warfare&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerns around solar geoengineering deployment – such as those identified by the US intelligence community – have typically centred on these technologies being used as extreme responses to mounting climate pressures. Yet more recently, some experts have raised the alarm about how they might be leveraged by hostile actors to further their interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There currently appears to be no publicly available evidence suggesting the Kremlin is planning on weaponising solar geoengineering technologies, or that it has even considered this. However, their relative ease of deployment, legal ambiguities surrounding their use, and the potential for plausible deniability could make them an attractive tool in an era of intensifying hybrid warfare where there are fewer guardrails to restrain state behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the controversial nature of these technologies means they could be used to cause widespread disruption, even without enabling negative climate impacts, due to high levels of anxiety surrounding their development. Given this possibility, Russia’s scientific credentials in this field and Russian military intelligence’s history of allegedly using novel methods to inflict harm on adversaries, it seems plausible that Moscow may experiment with weaponising solar geoengineering in the coming decade, even though this scenario may have seemed outlandish just a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-challenges-and-recommendations-for-policymakers&quot;&gt;Key Challenges and Recommendations for Policymakers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike most acts of sabotage or cyberattacks, it would probably be difficult for most European intelligence agencies to detect, attribute or prevent the use of solar geoengineering as a weapon given current capabilities and priorities. Any early warning would therefore be limited, raising the risk of strategic surprise. This challenge is likely to be compounded by uncertainty over where responsibility for solar geoengineering governance should lie. There is currently no international consensus on which forum, if any, is best positioned to lead on this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, several states and multinational organisations appear to be scaling back efforts to examine issues like this that sit at the intersection of climate change and national security. This de-prioritisation risks eroding institutional awareness of the security implications of solar geoengineering technologies among defence, security and intelligence communities despite their potential to be used coercively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the UK increases investment in solar geoengineering research, a narrow but critical window exists to shape international norms and safeguards and establish red lines. The UK, given its growing role in this area, has an opportunity to lead efforts to embed prohibitions against the offensive or coercive use of solar geoengineering into international agreements and research protocols. It can also champion the creation of a dedicated intergovernmental task force – under the UN, NATO, or an alternative body – to monitor militarisation risks, enhance transparency and establish response mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, risks linked to solar geoengineering should be integrated into national and allied security strategies and planning frameworks. This would help to build understanding and cultivate resilience against any potential future hybrid threats involving climate manipulation. The UK intelligence community, meanwhile, should treat these technologies as it would other emerging hybrid threats – investing in detection and attribution capabilities, and coordinating across government agencies to spot and track early signs of misuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】參與2020年初選案的47人涉嫌串謀顛覆國家政權，其中31名被告認罪，不認罪16人當中有14人經審訊後被裁定罪成，李予信及劉偉聰2人罪脫。除了施德來及柯耀林，其餘12名經審訊後被裁定罪成的被告，連同認罪的黃子悅，合計13人提出上訴。另外律政司尋求法庭推翻就劉偉聰的無罪裁決。案件今早在西九法院（暫代高等法院）進行，預計需時10天，由高院首席法官潘兆初、上訴庭法官彭偉昌及彭寶琴審理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;經審訊後被裁定罪成並提出上訴的12名被告包括何啟明、陳志全、鄒家成、吳政亨、何桂藍、彭卓棋、鄭達鴻、余慧明、黃碧雲、林卓廷、楊雪盈和梁國雄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;有市民昨晚起排隊旁聽&quot;&gt;有市民昨晚起排隊旁聽&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;早上約六時，在西九龍裁判法院門外已有約20位市民排隊領取旁聽席籌，現場天色昏暗，曾落起毛毛雨。人稱「姨婆」的婆婆排首位，昨下午四時已到場。她左胸掛有記協「逆風前行」的布章匙扣，稱怕「排隊黨」出現故提早到法院。雖然知道自己幫不到他們，但亦希望告訴在監獄外一直支持。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jtu0Yiw.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;百歲「大黃伯」攜一支拐杖和一把雨傘到場，稱在場旁聽是很重要，「見得一次多一次，好耐無見咪嚟見吓啲人」，他又指各被告並非罪犯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/56CEI3c.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何先生亦因怕「排隊黨」會出現，昨晚約九時到場排隊，稱自己的出現是希望「克制」他們，不過「排隊黨」至凌晨仍未有出現。他寄語上訴的被告不要放棄希望。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;早上約六時開始排隊的陳女士指，若初選案犯法，「我哋投票嘅係咪都犯法」，希望親身旁聽可以「話畀佢哋聽仲有我哋喺度。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;曾任林卓廷義工的陳先生，則身穿「不在真話中崛起，就在謊言中滅亡」的紅色T恤，他指過去曾穿不同衣服旁聽，被三度禁止進入，這一件則未曾被攔下。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;劉偉聰脫罪-律政司上訴要求發還案件予原審法庭繼續處理&quot;&gt;劉偉聰脫罪 律政司上訴要求發還案件予原審法庭繼續處理&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/j9ia49P.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;上訴庭上午先處理律政司針對劉偉聰的案件呈述上訴。律政司一方指稱，從初選開始到結束，劉的整體行為均與涉案的犯罪協議一致，包括提交初選提名表格、參選初選、落選後遵從協議而不出選立法會選舉。律政司要求上訴庭裁定劉偉聰參與在涉案計劃及串謀之中，推翻無罪裁決，並發還案件予原審法庭繼續處理。任職大律師的劉偉聰自行在庭上陳詞，重申他從沒主張「五大訴求，缺一不可」，亦從沒主張「無差別」否決特區政府提出的財政預算案。高院首席法官潘兆初表示押後判決，並批准劉繼續保釋外出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;由高院首席法官潘兆初、上訴庭法官彭偉昌及彭寶琴審理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;經審訊後被裁定罪成並提出上訴的12名被告包括：何啟明、陳志全、鄒家成、吳政亨、何桂藍、彭卓棋、鄭達鴻、余慧明、黃碧雲、林卓廷、楊雪盈和梁國雄。認罪囚4年5個月的黃子悅，則提出刑期上訴。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;彭卓棋撤回上訴並提早離席&quot;&gt;彭卓棋撤回上訴並提早離席&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;接近開庭時間，13名上訴人陸續被懲教人員帶入被告欄，各人分別向家屬和友人揮手。何桂藍和余慧明均蓄短髮，其中何桂藍穿上白色T恤及桃紅色恤衫。鄭達鴻、陳志全和林卓廷均穿著西裝褸，梁國雄則穿著哲古華拉T恤。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;甫開庭，首席法官潘兆初表示收到彭卓棋律師代表的通知，彭會撤回上訴，並指這代表彭的上訴會被撤銷。代表彭的大律師向法庭確認，並表示今早已索取彭的指示，她為律師團隊遲來的通知而向法庭致歉。彭卓棋及其律師團隊申請離席獲批，其後彭卓棋從被告欄中站起身及步回懲教囚室。彭卓棋的胞弟彭家浩亦有到庭旁聽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉偉聰原審脫罪-律政司上訴要求發還&quot;&gt;劉偉聰原審脫罪 律政司上訴要求發還&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;上訴庭上午先處理律政司針對劉偉聰的案件呈述上訴。代表律政司的副刑事檢控專員周天行陳詞指，原審法庭未能按證據而裁定劉是參與犯罪協議的一份子。周指，劉出席了九龍西的第一次初選協調會議，顯示涉案串謀最早於2020年3月便存在。劉其後於3至4月收妥有關協調機制的文件，亦於6月提交了初選報名表格。劉同月參與初選論壇，即使《國安法》在同年7月1日實施，劉依然繼續參與7月11至12日的初選。周指，劉在初選落敗之後，他遵守涉案的協議，立即停止所有選舉工程，甚至在7月14日在社交媒體平台發布帖文，表示尊重初選結果及協調會議的安排，不會出選立法會選舉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周指稱，從初選開始到結束，劉上述的整體行為均與涉案的犯罪協議一致，又指劉不僅對涉案計劃的目標知情，更參與其中，包括提交初選提名表格、參選初選、落選後遵從協議而不出選立法會選舉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;律政司要求上訴庭裁定劉偉聰參與在涉案計劃及串謀之中，推翻無罪裁決，並根據《刑事訴訟程序條例》第81DD條，發還案件予原審法庭「恢復進行該審訊」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉偉聰自行陳詞從沒主張無差別否決財案&quot;&gt;劉偉聰自行陳詞：從沒主張「無差別」否決財案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本身任職大律師的劉偉聰並沒有聘請法律代表，他自行在庭上陳詞，表示會採納早前提交的書面陳詞，不必勞煩上訴庭聽他重覆觀點。不過他仍希望簡短地作出總結，他重申他從沒主張「五大訴求，缺一不可」，他從沒主張迫使行政長官辭職，他亦從沒主張「無差別」否決特區政府提出的財政預算案。劉最後強調，原審法庭的事實裁斷，不應被隨意干預。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;高院首席法官潘兆初表示保留判決，將會連同被告的上訴一同宣判。潘官並批准劉以原有條件繼續保釋外出，又批准劉先行離席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;上訴方立會透過控制銀包監察政府-司法機關不應干預立會行使權力&quot;&gt;上訴方：立會透過「控制銀包」監察政府 司法機關不應干預立會行使權力&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/MvUKIb5.png&quot; alt=&quot;image12&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2020年初選47人涉嫌串謀顛覆國家政權，其中31名被告認罪，不認罪16人當中有14人經審訊後被裁定罪成，李予信及劉偉聰2人罪脫。除了施德來及柯耀林，其餘12名經審訊後被裁定罪成的被告，連同認罪的黃子悅，合共13人提出上訴。案件今（14日）在西九龍法院（暫代高等法院）聆訊，彭卓棋確認撤回上訴並離席。餘下12人繼續上訴。上訴一方先就法律爭議陳詞，他們指稱《基本法》下，行政、立法和司法之間的監察和權力制衡是非常重要，當中提及特首辭職的機制，對於監察特首權力是重要的；數百年以來立法機關透過控制政府的「錢包」，來達至監察和制衡行政機關權力，因此迫使特首辭職的機制在《基本法》下屬正當程序。上訴方又指，立法會議員有權自由地投票，他們為了爭取政治訴求而投票並不能構成濫權；再者，「五大訴求」當中亦包括《基本法》所承諾的普選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;由高院首席法官潘兆初、上訴庭法官彭偉昌及彭寶琴審理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;經審訊後被裁定罪成並提出上訴的12名被告包括：何啟明、陳志全、鄒家成、吳政亨、何桂藍、彭卓棋、鄭達鴻、余慧明、黃碧雲、林卓廷、楊雪盈和梁國雄。認罪囚4年5個月的黃子悅，則提出刑期上訴。其中彭卓棋在早上開庭後確認撤回上訴，並且先行離席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;上訴方基本法規定重選立法會後仍否決財案-特首需辭職-因行政與立法互相監察制衡&quot;&gt;上訴方：《基本法》規定重選立法會後仍否決財案 特首需辭職 因行政與立法互相監察制衡&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;上訴人一方先就法律議題陳詞，他們提出四項法律爭議，包括被告的行為是否構成不法行為、被告有否顛覆國家政權的意圖、被告的真誠信念，以及「非法手段」只限於犯罪行為。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表黃碧雲的大律師沈士文指，《基本法》第73條定下立法會的職權，第104條則規定立法會議員就職時必須依法宣誓擁護《基本法》及效忠中華人民共和國香港特別行政區。沈指，一名議員投票否決政府議案是否構成濫權或違背職權，是關於《基本法》第73及104條的詮釋問題，與《國安法》的詮釋無關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈指，《基本法》規定，若財案遭否決的話，行政長官便要解散立法會及舉行重選；若然新的立法會再度否決財案，行政長官就必須辭職，這種「法定後果（prescribed consequences）」與《國安法》第22條「顛覆國家政權」罪中所指的「干擾、阻礙或破壞其依法履行職能」後果（subversive consequences）並不相同。沈指，這種觸發特首辭職的機制，在回歸之前寫進《基本法》，原意是預料到在一個民主的政制下，行政與立法機關之間有互相監察和制衡。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;上訴方立法會透過控制銀包來監察政府&quot;&gt;上訴方：立法會透過「控制銀包」來監察政府&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈續指，《基本法》下的特首辭職機制乃基於法治制度而設立，意味當立法會想爭取某些訴求時，他們可以基於與議案無關的考慮而投票否決，而不會構成「顛覆國家政權」。沈又指，控方在原審時未有提供任何外國例子，顯示在其他國家否決財政預算案會構成顛覆政權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈指，《基本法》下所有條文均是平等，沒有任何階級之分，意味行政、立法和司法的權力均是對等，沒有任何一方的權力在另一方之上。沈指，控方指稱議員應該基於財案的優劣，投票通過財案，又指稱「五大訴求」與財案無關，沈則反駁控方說法並不符《基本法》的精神。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈又指，在《基本法》下，行政、立法和司法之間的監察和權力制衡是非常重要。沈指，上述提及特首辭職的機制對於監察特首權力是重要的，因特首和行政機關須向立法會負責；而且財案與其他重要議案區分開來，乃基於一種維持了數百年的遠古概念，即透過控制政府的「錢包」，來達至監察和制衡行政機關權力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;上訴方應交由公眾決定否決財案與否-司法機關不應干預立法會行使權力&quot;&gt;上訴方：應交由公眾決定否決財案與否 司法機關不應干預立法會行使權力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈指，「收緊錢包」乃最後的手段，雖然可能導致非常嚴重的後果，但是其中一個可能性是特首願意商討及修改財案，否則特首要解散立法會，引發立法會重選；其後，新就任的立法會需再次就財案表決，如果再次否決的話，特首便要辭職。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈認為，有關議題應留待公眾決定，司法機關不應干預立法會行使其權力，「政治問題應留待政治解決」，因此政治問題應留待立法會內處理。沈又指，有關議題應留待公眾決定，而非由法庭去決定。他舉例指，若然數以百萬計市民上街要求特首下台，那麼立法會議員會對財案投反下對票，反問：「這不是一個政治議題嗎？不是應該交由公眾決定嗎？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;上訴方迫使特首辭職的機制在基本法下屬正當程序&quot;&gt;上訴方：迫使特首辭職的機制在《基本法》下屬正當程序&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈指，議員在議會上的言行應免受刑事檢控，為了讓他們能夠無懼地在議會上發言。若果議員因為說了一些與議案無關的東西，而遭受檢控的話，這無異於他們因為否決議案而被檢控。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈提到「墨落無悔」聲明，簽署人公開地表明一旦當選，投票時會將「五大訴求」納入考慮，因他們希望公眾知情以及投票給他們。然而根據《基本法》第73條，議員有權自由地投票，而無責任解釋投票背後的理由。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對於控方指稱被告嘗試迫使特首按照《基本法》而辭職，構成了顛覆國家政權；沈則回應指被告實際上是迫使政府按照《基本法》行事，而且迫使特首辭職的機制在《基本法》下屬正當程序，政府的職能並未有嚴重地遭受干預。沈批評控方由始至終都錯誤地解讀《基本法》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈總結指，立法會議員有權自由地投票，他們為了政治訴求而投票並不能構成濫權。再者，「五大訴求」當中亦包括《基本法》所承諾的普選，因此議員基於爭取「五大訴求」而投票，並不構成濫用權力。沈又指，通過財政預算案只是立法會眾多職能之一，理應整體地解讀《基本法》。沈又指，法庭不應該干預立法會行使權力的方法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;上訴方引致基本法下的法定後果並不足以構成顛覆意圖&quot;&gt;上訴方：引致《基本法》下的「法定後果」並不足以構成顛覆意圖&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於第二項法律議題，即被告有否顛覆國家政權的意圖，沈士文指其當事人黃碧雲在初選論壇期間，被另一名較激進的參選人問到會否決財案，當時黃回答她會根據《基本法》而行使權力，從中可見黃並沒有顛覆國家政權的特定意圖，也無意不論如何都會破壞香港政府。沈指，議員有意引致《基本法》下的「法定後果」並不足以構成顛覆的意圖，因此原審法庭在裁決中指稱黃碧雲有意圖顛覆政權，是犯了錯誤。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈其後補充，若果說引致《基本法》下的「法定後果」時，一旦滲雜了不合法手段，那麼整個意圖便變成了顛覆國家的意圖，便是錯誤的。沈總結指，就本案而言，觸發《基本法》下的「法定後果」，並不會自動構成顛覆國家政權的意圖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;上訴方顛覆國家政權控罪僅針對武力或血腥推翻政權&quot;&gt;上訴方：「顛覆國家政權」控罪僅針對武力或血腥推翻政權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大律師關文渭接著就「非法手段」是否僅限於犯罪行為陳詞。他指，《國安法》第22條涉及「顛覆國家政權」罪行條文中，含有「以武力、威脅使用武力或者其他非法手段」字眼；然而，第20條涉及「分裂國家」罪行的條文，卻只有「不論是否使用武力或者以武力相威脅」字眼，而不包含「其他非法手段」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關力陳，兩種罪行的條文寫法有如此分別，是因為國家領土完整是不可退讓的，因此「分裂國家」罪行的條文中，只包含「不論是否使用武力或者以武力相威脅」字眼，意味不論以武力或和平手段均是法律所不容。至於「顛覆國家政權」，則由於國家政權更替的情況於歷史上經常發生，有時涉及血腥武力，有時卻是和平進行，而《國安法》所防範的只是血腥地推翻國家政權，所以和平合法的手段並不會構成「顛覆國家政權」。關堅稱「其他非法手段」只限於犯罪行為，而不包括合法的行為。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;首席法官潘兆初指，《基本法》第12條乃有關於香港特區的制度，指明香港特區是一個享有高度自治權的地方行政區域，直轄於中央人民政府；若然真的如關文渭所說，「顛覆國家政權」控罪只針對武力手段的話，而不針對挑戰的《基本法》第12條行為，是否「顛覆國家政權」的立法原意？關文渭則回應，《基本法》第12條強調香港特區直轄於中央人民政府，若然有任何行為觸犯此條文，那便會落入「分裂國家」的控罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;上訴方其他非法手段意指犯罪行為-符合一般市民理解&quot;&gt;上訴方：「其他非法手段」意指「犯罪行為」 符合一般市民理解&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表余慧明的資深大律師彭耀鴻透露，余慧明申請法援被拒，早前已上訴，可是當她得悉其他被告都有相同結果的時候，便決定撤回法援上訴。換言之，現時他繼續代表余而不收費。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;原審裁決理由書指，若然有關「顛覆國家政權」罪行的條文中，「或者其他非法手段」僅限於違法的行為，那麼人大草擬《國安法》時大可以直接使用「犯罪手段」字眼。裁決又指，辯方的解讀不但使「顛覆國家政權」罪行的條文過份地複雜，又或者導致控方需要證明「罪行中的罪行」，而且會嚴重地削弱有關條文的效用，不能達至防範和遏制危害國安罪行的立法目的。原審法庭遂裁定「其他非法手段」不限於「犯罪行為」，而是「武力或威脅使用武力」以外的手段。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭耀鴻則強調，他們對於條文的解讀並不會導致條文累贅，又稱需要對比不同的法律條文，例如「非法管有」、「非法提供國家情報秘密」等，某字眼的意思乃視乎上文下理，當上文下理有異的時候，字眼意思便會不同，這能夠解釋「其他非法手段」的意思是「犯罪行為」，一般市民亦會以這樣的方式解讀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭強調，《國安法》不只是寫給律師的法律，而是寫給香港市民，意味普羅大眾理應明白有關條文，如果一般市民不能夠理解，又或者條文的意思超出市民所能理解，市民又怎樣可以約束自己的行為？按照日常生活的理解，條文中「非法手段」字眼必然意指「犯罪行為」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;上訴方真誠地相信憲法下有權否決財案-可構成辯護理由&quot;&gt;上訴方：真誠地相信憲法下有權否決財案 可構成辯護理由&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表何啟明和陳志全的大律師馬維騉指，若財案被立法會否決，造成政府職能被中止或干預，只是因為特首按照《基本法》第50至52條，履行憲法下權力所造成的「自然結果（natural consequence）」，並不構成立法會議員顛覆國家政權，被告也就沒有顛覆國家政權的意圖。不論有關的後果多麼嚴重，相關條文對於行政與立法之間監察制衡是有需要，以及有助解決立法會的死局。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬又指，當被告真誠地相信他們在憲法下完全有權否決財案，並且相信不會觸犯法律，便可構成辯護理由；即使有關信念是錯誤的信念，法庭也不能裁定他們有罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬又指，控方指稱不論政府議案優劣，被告都會「無差別地」投票否決，然而控方沒有足夠證據顯示被告不會審視財案，尤其是陳志全有多年擔任議員的經驗。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何桂藍當政府未考慮民意時才會否決財案-強調非濫用職權&quot;&gt;何桂藍：當政府未考慮民意時才會否決財案 強調非濫用職權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 補充指，被告一方從沒使用「無差別」字眼，這只是控方會使用的字眼。他解釋，被告有民意授權去否決財案，是因為他們曾告訴公眾他們當選後會做什麼，這使他們當選立法會議員後能夠與政府談判，一旦政府未有考慮他們背後的民意，他們才會否決財案，Beel 強調這是行使議員職能，而非濫用權力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 指，原審法庭指被告意圖濫用職權、違反《基本法》第37條，只是一個「方便的裁斷」，然而這個「方便的裁斷」並沒有證據支持。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

On this matter, the work of the UN Working Group on the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination, has been of significant importance (hereinafter, UN WG on Mercenaries) Additionally, the UN Human Rights Council has consistently emphasized the need to strengthen oversight mechanisms to address these evolving challenges.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This contribution elaborates on three specific trends that appear insufficiently prioritized in current regulatory discussions, highlights existing regulatory gaps and challenges, and calls for urgent regulatory attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;maritime-security&quot;&gt;Maritime Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the emerging trends in private military and security operations posing significant challenges to existing regulatory frameworks governing Private Military and Security Companies (PMSCs) concerns maritime security. The UN increasingly identifies maritime security as integral to international peace and legal order, as evolving threats expose growing regulatory gaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PMSCs have played a central role in responding to piracy and terrorism targeting commercial shipping and maritime trade routes, shifting their operations from traditional land-based activities towards increasingly complex roles in international waters. Protection provided by PMSCs not only reduces the risk of piracy attacks on contracted vessels but also lowers the likelihood of attacks on nearby vessels by approximately 7%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, with significant downsizing of the industry, a consequence of reduced high-risk areas, regulatory problems observed are related to regulation of the floating armories (FAs). While the UN Working Group on Mercenaries addressed a number of regulatory challenges related to use and operations of maritime PMSCs (2022), operations of the floating armories continue to raise concerns. Recent incidents of sinking vessels used as FAs close to conflict areas, without international oversight of transfer/management of stockpiles on them, raise further concerns about their regulation. While the International Maritime Organization does not have specific regulatory framework guiding operations of FAs, the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) addresses criminal jurisdiction on board of a foreign ship, which is quite limited in relation to territorial waters, and shifts responsibility mainly to regulate activities and operations of FAs to Flag states. As Flag States do not have (in general mode) particular oversight mechanisms of FAs, nor do they perform their audits, there is a clear gap in oversight of the global operations of FAs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, considering oversight of weapons and operations of maritime Private Security Companies (PSCs), there are concerns that even though some Flag States have quite a comprehensive regulatory framework regarding registration and certification of maritime PSCs, they often lack oversight capabilities, and depend on documented reports only. For instance, inspections of vessels using PSCs staff, to verify if arms are properly stored, if they are operational, or living/working conditions of the staff operating on vessels, are not a common procedure. Additionally, concerns over PSCs employees’ rights relate to difficulty reporting potential abuse, lack of payment or poor working conditions incompatible with Flag State national laws. This is a consequence of widespread hiring by maritime PSCs across the globe, including in less developed countries, unaware of their rights under Flag States national law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these constraints are becoming more important in a context where PMSCs are increasingly recognized as critical non-state actors in maritime security, and questions arise regarding their de facto substitution of state responsibilities in this domain as well as lack of international regulatory mechanisms responsible for global oversight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;weapons-procurement-and-transfers&quot;&gt;Weapons Procurement and Transfers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second emerging issue concerns the role of PMSCs in arms procurement and transfer activities. The arms trade network has changed and PMSCs possess an increasing capacity to procure arms and facilitate weapons transfers to states and non-state clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many states have legal, regulatory, and contractual provisions in place regarding PMSCs involvement in the “sub-delegation” of the acquisition of arms and weapons that follows tracing, recording, and “end-certification” processes, some do not. PMSCs involvement in arms procurement risks undermining existing arms control regimes and oversight mechanisms, the majority of which are State-focused, as well as falling outside of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instruments such as the Firearms Protocol, Arms Trade Treaty, and the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons do not recognize the possibility of PMSCs engaging in weapons transfers. Similarly, the Montreux Document “best practices” and the ICoCA “Code of Conduct” – neither of which legally binding instruments – place the responsibility of arms acquisition and transfer on contracting, home and territorial states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conflict and/or weak governance settings, PMSCs have engaged in acquisitions and transfers on behalf of States that do not follow established procedures of registration and end-user certification. This entails the use of brokers, intermediaries, and the fabrication of documentation. PMSCs have also acquired weapons via state “re-routing” (i.e. the diversion of a legal state-state transfer, that is re-routed onto the PMSC for use, sale, transfer). This complicates the traceability, end-user verification process, and control over arms transfers. These practices have been flagged as creating heightened risks of diversion to sanctioned armed groups, in violation of UN Security Council arms embargoes.Of particular concern is the growing nexus between PMSCs and “grey and black markets, networks and financing”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emerging technologies, such as uncrewed aerial systems and 3D printed weapons “ghost guns”, represent a new frontier not only in weapons development and manufacturing, but also in the expanding operational capabilities and commercial activities of PMSCs. PMSCs have been connected to the supply and sale of such additive components as a means of self-funding, raising concerns about PMCSs connections to illicit networks, their ability to raise illicit funds, and the circulation of unmarked, unverified weapon components and technologies. Moreover, the increasing availability of dual-use technologies — applicable for both civilian and military purposes — further complicates oversight, blurring the line between legitimate trade and unauthorized proliferation, and challenging existing export control regimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PMSCs are also increasingly engaged in utilizing digital tools and cyber-technologies for surveillance, intelligence gathering, operational planning and targeting in conflict and non-conflict situations. This growing reliance on cyber-enabled services is likely to persist and expand, yet currently unfolds within a largely unregulated international legal framework. In some cases, PMSCs have even been implicated in the development and operation of offensive cyber capabilities, raising significant concerns under international law governing cyber operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;predatory-recruitment-practices&quot;&gt;Predatory Recruitment Practices&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another emerging trend concerns the growing prevalence of exploitative or predatory recruitment practices. The involvement of PMSCs in conflict, post-conflict, and proxy war contexts has intensified recruitment efforts, facilitated by globalized labor markets. While recruitment often adheres to national and international standards, there is increasing evidence that PMSCs exploit vulnerabilities among prospective recruits, leading to abusive and coercive labor practices, in violation of applicable human rights obligations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Global South has become a key labor pool for PMSCs, exacerbating existing inequalities based on citizenship, socioeconomic status, gender, social class, and race. These disparities render PMSC personnel particularly vulnerable to exploitation and labor rights violations. This practice became even more evident in the aftermath of COVID-19, as migration of individuals seeking better employment opportunities in other countries increased; and also among prisoners, in many cases serving sentences in states different from their own nationalities, where they are offered amnesty or pardon deals in exchange for enlisting in PMSCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recruitment is often conducted through internal databases, digital platforms, and targeted branding campaigns using provocative messaging and promises of lucrative compensation to attract highly specialized freelance personnel. However, emerging reports document instances where promised benefits are not delivered, where fraud and coercion occur, and where these practices amount to violations of international human rights norms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;concluding-remarks&quot;&gt;Concluding Remarks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rapid diversification of PMSC activities underscores the urgent need for the international community to confront not only the traditional challenges associated with the outsourcing of military and security functions, but also the increasingly complex regulatory gaps emerging in new operational domains. These developments reveal a clear trend: PMSCs are no longer confined to conventional combat support or logistical roles but are extending into areas that directly affect the rights and safety of civilians, the integrity of international legal regimes, and the sovereign functions of States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The regulatory vacuum that persists across multiple domains –including maritime security, arms transfers, and labor practices–, poses serious threats to international human rights and international humanitarian law. This vacuum reflects not only regulatory gaps, but an erosion of the state’s monopoly on legitimate force, challenging attribution, effective control, and state responsibility. Without clear, enforceable international standards, PMSCs may continue to operate in legal grey zones, shielded from effective accountability mechanisms while exercising functions that often approach, or even replace, core State responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, the work of the Open-ended Intergovernmental Working Group on PMSCs takes on renewed urgency. A robust, legally binding international instrument is indispensable to establish clear obligations for States, to regulate the transnational operations of PMSCs, particularly in emerging, hybrid, non-traditional domains, so as to ensure human rights abuses are prevented, and provide adequate access and remedy to justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effective regulation of PMSCs is not merely a technical legal challenge; it is a matter of upholding the foundational principles of international law, protecting human dignity, and preserving the accountability architecture upon which global peace and security depend. The current moment presents a critical opportunity for States, international organizations, and civil society to forge a comprehensive, future-proof regulatory framework that meets the evolving challenges of private military and security governance.&lt;/p&gt;

Would there be survivors? Would your iPhone work? This briefing dispels common misconceptions about high-altitude nuclear explosions and summarizes the current state of research on the subject.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, no party has used nuclear weapons in war since 1945. Treaties limiting nuclear tests and weapon inventories during the Cold War highlighted the pragmatism of world leaders. As memories fade, and nascent nuclear states mature, the potential for their use (or misuse) rises. In a strategic environment with multiple nuclear-armed states of various sizes and incentives, it is important to understand the science underlying the use of nuclear weapons in novel and unexpected ways. As opposed to the ground bursts of World War II, their use in the sky has potential to achieve certain objectives without catastrophic loss of life. Due partly to the lack of testing and partly to a somber reluctance to consider this potentiality, many misunderstandings persist. There is a need to address prevailing myths about the use of high-altitude nuclear explosions and provide realities rooted in the existing research on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waging war against an enemy with dominant digital communications systems is a recipe for defeat. Modern digital communications structures enable lethal kill-chain targeting cycles, seamless command and control, and precision guidance that dominate the enemy. This reality makes the space and cyber domains a primary target in future warfare. All tacticians seek to degrade their adversaries’ communications in war, but few consider the literal “nuclear option” that could fundamentally upend the current communications ecosystem. High-altitude nuclear explosions (HANEs) allow an actor to degrade modern communications, either on the ground or in the sky. Closer to the ground, HANEs create a high-altitude electromagnetic pulse (HEMP) that could shut down power plants, cellular towers, and electronic devices. Higher in the sky, HANEs produce radiation that can damage or destroy satellites. If a state actor (or rogue element) decides that access to digital systems or the space domain is giving its adversary an unfair edge, it might decide to use a HANE to negate this advantage without directly killing a single human.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The norm against using nuclear weapons endured for decades, but recent saber-rattling and proliferation trends suggest this restraint is fragile. Would adversaries consider launching a HANE attack that destroys and degrades electronics without direct loss of human life? Would such an attack be perceived as a breach of the international taboo on nuclear weapons use? This paper examines existing research on HANE effects to dispel misconceptions and clarify the potential consequences of such a scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hane-effects-101&quot;&gt;HANE Effects 101&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A HANE is a nuclear detonation above 30 kilometers (19 miles), where the density of air is low enough that energy from the nuclear weapon interacts with its surroundings in a markedly different manner than a “mushroom cloud” of a detonation nearer to the ground. These detonations create damage to electronics within the Earth’s atmosphere through their production of HEMPs. E1, the most damaging HEMP mechanism created by HANEs, results because the air density is extremely low around the explosion, unlike at lower altitudes. Therefore, electromagnetic radiation can travel great distances in a downward direction before interacting with air molecules (Figure 1). Many of these interactions result in ionization, or the freeing of electrons, which cause a burst of electromagnetic energy as they are deflected by the Earth’s magnetic field. This burst of energy, or EMP, occurs over a large area, where it causes damage and disruption to electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/268Z0IJ.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Creation of the E1 Field of a HEMP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HANEs can damage or destroy satellites through two primary mechanisms. First, high levels of prompt radiation from gamma rays, X-rays, and neutrons can travel relatively unimpeded directly to satellites due to the low density of the atmosphere (Figure 2). This is limited to satellites within line of sight (LOS) of the HANE, with the Earth shielding many others. The amount of prompt radiation, or dose, that a satellite receives increases with increasing yield and decreases proportional to the square of the distance from the explosion. Second, free electrons resulting from an explosion can become trapped in artificial radiation belts due to the Earth’s magnetic field, creating a hostile environment for satellites passing through. These electrons can be trapped for years and may drastically decrease the lifespans of satellites orbiting through them, even if they were initially outside of the HANE’s LOS. Additionally, this radiation belt presents challenges in reconstituting space with new satellites due to the lasting effects. For example, a new satellite designed to last two years may only last a couple of months due to the new trapped radiation. Shielding and radiation hardening can significantly increase the amount of radiation dose required for damage from both of these mechanisms; however, it is not practical to completely shield from the prompt effects of a HANE of sufficient yield and proximity. Additionally, shielding to the level required to protect against HANE effects is generally only seen in military satellites because it is currently cost-prohibitive for commercial applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/AtIxi0J.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: Prompt Radiation Field of View from a 400-km (LEO) HANE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;space-ground-or-both&quot;&gt;Space, Ground, or Both&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Altitude is the key factor determining whether the most significant effects of a HANE are experienced on the ground or on satellites. An explosion at a height of 30 kilometers (19 miles) would create an appreciable, though not maximal, EMP and have minimal effects on satellites. Satellites in this scenario are largely unscathed due to the attenuation of prompt radiation in the Earth’s atmosphere and further distance from low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. Peak HEMP E1 occurs close to 75 kilometers (47 miles) above the surface and starts to drop off considerably after 100 kilometers (62 miles), as shown in Figure 3. While the strength of the HEMP decreases considerably above this height, the ground area affected increases (Figure 4). Higher altitude HANEs, such as the previous U.S. test Starfish Prime at 300 kilometers (186 miles), affect a larger area but have a much weaker associated HEMP. These higher explosions will also have significantly greater impacts on satellites due to a lack of attenuation in the atmosphere, their closer proximity to many satellites in orbit, and the increasing field of view of satellites at risk with increasing altitude (Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;myth-1-no-one-would-use-a-nuclear-weapon-even-at-high-altitude&quot;&gt;Myth #1: No One Would Use a Nuclear Weapon (Even at High Altitude)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The constraint against nuclear explosions held true for over 70 years and made sense when the costs of international repercussions outweighed the benefits from use. For decades, the structuralism of the global order constrained adversaries. Post–World War II geopolitics rarely degenerated into great power combat because it was not in any nation’s interest to do so. Structures such as the United Nations and the World Trade Organization provided forums where countries could achieve political objectives without resorting to violence. In 1963, the United States, Soviet Union, and United Kingdom signed the Limited Test Ban Treaty (LTBT), which prohibits nuclear weapons tests in the atmosphere, outer space, and underwater. After the Cold War, globalism guaranteed collective gains for states willing to abide by international norms. Thomas Friedman described a “Golden Straitjacket” that offers nations wealth and progress if they abide by the rules and norms of the international order. Multiple indicators—from the Russian invasion of sovereign European territory and threats of tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine to the United States stepping back from international bodies—suggest this era is nearing its end, and nations should prepare for the dynamics of a post-globalism era. It is impossible to predict when a pariah state will finally decide that its national interests are better served by destroying the tools the rest of the world depends upon. However, the reasons for their restraint appear to be decreasing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use could be precise or haphazard. A rational state actor would wait until the optimum time to use latent capabilities to uproot the world order. While one state could use a bevy of tools, such as cyberattacks and anti-satellite weapons, to temporarily disrupt satellite and internet access without permanent destruction, another state actor may consider the large, destructive effects a single HANE offers. And while the leaders of each of these nations have thus far restrained themselves, there is the possibility that a coup or uprising could result in more unpredictable leadership that would use available tools in unpredictable ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the ongoing Russia-Ukraine War, the space domain remains accessible to all sides, allowing advanced communications, weapons guidance, drone operations, and data integration. This semi-permissive access is not guaranteed in future warfare. Russia and its precursor, the Soviet Union, have a history of surprising scientific breakthroughs that upend geopolitics. In 1957, the Soviet Union shocked the world with the launch of Sputnik, the first artificial Earth satellite. In 2021, Russia destroyed one of its own satellites with an antisatellite missile, foreshadowing a future threat to the United States’ vast orbital communication infrastructure. In 2024, after withdrawing from multiple arms control agreements, Russia launched a satellite in orbit that could employ a nuclear weapon. U.S. Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy Vipin Narang stated that the prospect of this space weapon poses “a threat to satellites operated by countries and companies around the globe, as well as to the vital communications, scientific, meteorological, agricultural, commercial, and national security services upon which we all depend.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is also actively studying the effects of space-based nuclear weapons. The Northwest Institute of Nuclear Technology (NINT), a People’s Liberation Army (PLA) research and development institute, published a paper detailing the effects of a space-based nuclear weapon on LEO satellites like the Starlink network. Another NINT paper noted, “A combination of soft and hard kill methods should be adopted to make some Starlink satellites lose their functions and destroy the constellation’s operating system.” From the figures in that paper, one can identify optimal altitudes for various military effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;myth-2-hemps-will-disable-everything-electronic&quot;&gt;Myth #2: HEMPs Will Disable Everything Electronic&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Call of Duty franchise offers HEMPs as an option during battle. When a player uses one, it disables all the opponent’s command and control capabilities, such as their map, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assets, and even their electronic weapon sights for a fixed period. While Call of Duty brings attention to the topic of HEMPs to a wider audience, it misrepresents them in many ways. First, the in-game EMP consistently shuts down everything electronic. In reality, HEMPs create stochastic effects—which have a probability pattern that can be analyzed statistically, not predicted precisely. For example, one device could be destroyed, while an identical one meters away is spared due to having a slightly different orientation. Additionally, the HEMP effects from Call of Duty are transient, lasting under a minute, but would actually be varied over time. Many electrical components would be instantaneously and permanently damaged and never come back online, while others would be only temporarily disrupted. The misrepresentation of EMP effects seen in Call of Duty is not unique. Similar themes are seen in movies such as The Matrix, GoldenEye, and Ocean’s Eleven. The general public often overestimates the effects of a HEMP since these examples are often their only exposure to this subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effects of a HEMP on devices depend on the intensity of the EMP field, the orientation of the device with respect to that field, the inherent shielding of the device, and the sensitivity of the device’s microelectronics. The amount of energy collected depends on several factors, including its size and orientation to the pulse. Long cables, antennas, and railroad tracks would be able to collect a significant amount of energy that could damage large systems, such as large power transformers. While devices such as cellphones are small collectors, some components, such as semiconductor diodes and transistors, may be more sensitive to pulses from a HEMP. Three people standing next to each other with three different phones could have three different outcomes. One’s circuits may be relatively undamaged, with the owner noticing no internal disruption, while a second has issues that resolve after a restart, and a third person’s phone loses functionality critical to operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While two of the phones in this example are not destroyed, much of their functionality may be unavailable due to the modern, interconnected network of systems required. Gamma rays and X-rays can ionize atoms in the atmosphere, which can disrupt radiofrequency waves passing through them for anywhere from seconds to hours, depending on the frequency. Communications infrastructure, such as cell towers, may be inoperable due to damage from a HEMP, which could also disrupt the electrical power generation required to operate communications infrastructure. Finally, communications satellites at low Earth orbit—less than 2,000 kilometers (1,243 miles)—may also be disrupted or destroyed depending on the altitude of the HANE creating the HEMP. This is the orbital region most affected by HANEs and is advantageous for many communications satellites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to pinpoint the exact damage that could come from a HEMP due to the complex mechanisms and limited test data. It is important for decisionmakers to understand that there will be significant disruption and damage to electrical devices, but that it will not be ubiquitous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;myth-3-a-hane-harms-the-user-as-much-as-the-target&quot;&gt;Myth #3: A HANE Harms the User as Much as the Target&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HANEs have the capability to harm their user through both effects on their satellites and HEMP effects within the Earth’s atmosphere. Regarding the former, a common supposition exists that it would not make sense for a state to use a HANE in space because it would damage or destroy its own satellites as well. First, this assumes that all states are as reliant on satellites as the United States. Many nuclear-armed states are not. The United States is currently dominant in the satellite sector and has made multiple decisions and investments to maintain its strategic advantages in this domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, states can employ HANEs in ways that limit the amount of damage to their own satellites. For example, an actor could choose to detonate a HANE that optimizes damaging enemy satellites while minimizing collateral damage to its own based on satellite locations at the planned time and location of the detonation. However, given that there are thousands of satellites deployed in LEO—and that the prompt radiation field of view (as shown in Figure 2) means a HANE could affect up to 20 percent of LEO satellites—it is impossible for most states to avoid destroying a portion of their own satellites and causing significant damage to those of their allies and commercial entities. Additionally, trapped electrons could still affect many satellites that had been shielded from the HANE by the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To minimize space effects, a state could pursue a lower-altitude HANE, such as at around 30 kilometers (19 miles), to primarily target HEMP effects within the Earth’s atmosphere. If employed over the battlefield, HEMP attacks would likely disrupt both friendly and enemy units. In certain cases, this could benefit the user if it is less reliant on susceptible electronics. However, it may be more suitable for attacking a target nation that is physically separated from the battlefield. For example, Russia could employ a lower-altitude HANE over the United States to disrupt its geographically distant battlefield efforts in Eastern Europe. Attacks like these could significantly impact an enemy while costing little in terms of technological fratricide or direct loss of human life and could potentially have less chance of large-scale escalation than the use of a surface nuclear weapon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reality-1-hanes-offer-a-less-provocative-option-than-ground-based-nuclear-detonations&quot;&gt;Reality #1: HANEs Offer a Less Provocative Option than Ground-Based Nuclear Detonations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HANEs do not have the same direct effects on human lives. As they are detonated at an altitude where the atmosphere is very thin or nonexistent, this means no significant air blast will arrive on the ground and harm civilians or infrastructure. Additionally, very little prompt or delayed radiation will make it to the Earth’s surface due to attenuation or absorption by the atmosphere. The airblast, thermal, and radiation effects from traditional surface or near-surface detonations could lead to the direct deaths of millions of people and could prompt an equal or greater retaliatory strike on the state that originally employed such a weapon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HANEs offer a favorable option by avoiding these direct lethal effects on civilians. They can be targeted to primarily affect electronics on the ground, satellites, or a combination of both. Those detonated between the sweet spot of 30–50 kilometers (19–31 miles) above sea level create HEMPs that impact electronics on the ground but have less effect on satellites. This could be a desirable option for a state that wants to limit damage to its own satellites and minimize escalatory concerns associated with damaging nuclear command, control, and communications (NC3) satellites. HANEs detonated above that altitude also have the potential to destroy LEO satellites, causing catastrophic global economic effects and potentially affecting NC3 systems in orbit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reality-2-hanes-will-still-cause-human-suffering&quot;&gt;Reality #2: HANEs Will Still Cause Human Suffering&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the detonation would not directly kill humans, the indirect effects likely would. The long-term loss of power plants, cellular towers, and access to satellites would have profound effects on the affected population. In 2008, the U.S. congressional commission released a study on HEMP effects on U.S. territory. It noted, even 17 years ago, that the “pervasive use of electronics of all forms represents the greatest source of vulnerability to attack by EMP.” The report offered a somber acknowledgement of the long-term consequences of a HEMP attack on the United States:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A single EMP attack may seriously degrade or shut down a large part of the electric power grid. . . . Electrical power is necessary to support other critical infrastructures. . . . Many people may ultimately die for lack of the basic elements necessary to sustain life in dense urban and suburban communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response, Congress implemented several recommendations for U.S. power grids. These mitigate the risk but are unlikely to completely defend against loss of life. Additionally, less-developed nations remain vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reality--3-the-effects-of-hanes-can-be-anticipated-and-mitigated&quot;&gt;Reality # 3: The Effects of HANEs Can Be Anticipated and Mitigated&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are multiple steps policymakers can take to mitigate the effects of HANEs in future conflicts. Satellite effects can be reduced by focusing on radiation hardening to include shielding, physical changes of circuitry, and redundancy. Radiation-hardening components designed to withstand extreme post-HANE environments are currently a niche market for critical military satellites. The emphasis on hardening could be expanded to a broader set of devices, especially as many commercial satellites are starting to be used on the battlefield. HEMP effects within the Earth’s atmosphere can also be mitigated. Increased emphasis on HEMP testing could identify the most vulnerable systems early in the acquisition process so that these systems are designed with increased HEMP survivability from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the impact of HANEs can be mitigated through decreasing dependency on electronic systems and training. Military leaders should be wary of single capabilities that may be susceptible to an enemy HANE. Leaders should incorporate training scenarios for their soldiers that recreate degraded environments where some key capabilities are taken away, such as radios and GPS. Additionally, soldiers can be trained on how to minimize the effects of an EMP, for example, by ensuring there is redundancy in their communications pathways. They can also be trained in how to troubleshoot, identify, and (if necessary) repair damaged components of a system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While HANEs’ exact impact and long-term destruction will vary, this paper seeks to highlight what is known and dispel popular misunderstandings about them. In the past, global agreements formed a bulwark against the use of nuclear devices, but states are now relooking at their nuclear inventories and considering using these powerful devices in unconventional ways to achieve their goals. Leaders can no longer ignore this threat and the relevant effects posed by HANEs. Military leaders need to be cognizant of their effects on warfighters and capabilities, and local leaders need to understand their effects on power plants and civilian life. While the impacts of HANEs are difficult to grasp, there are tangible ways for U.S. policymakers and military leaders to mitigate them.&lt;/p&gt;

It should learn from the past – rather than repeating it – by avoiding the mistakes of Kissinger’s attempt to destabilise relations between Russia and China.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the idea of the so-called “reverse Kissinger” has become increasingly popular in the United States, which is based on the alleged possibility of the US government reaching an agreement with Russia to break its strategic cooperation with China, thereby reducing the combined threat. Supporters of this idea are inspired by the results of the US policy in the 1970s to improve relations with China, which was the product of advice given to American leaders during this period by the National Security Advisor and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certain elements of the “reverse Kissinger” strategy have been observed in US policy towards Russia in the last six months, which is recognized by both experts and individual representatives of the US administration. At the same time, this approach has not yet had any impact on Russia’s aggressive behaviour in the European theatre, but has probably only encouraged China to pursue even greater strategic rapprochement with Russia, the lack of alternative to which is increasingly being stated by the leaders of both countries. Given the dangers associated with such rapprochement, including for European and global security, it is appropriate to critically assess the idea of a “reverse Kissinger”, identify its main shortcomings and try to propose an alternative strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-us-sacrifice-of-taiwan&quot;&gt;The US Sacrifice of Taiwan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, it is worth honestly admitting that the original “Kissinger” is significantly overestimated, mythologized, and its frankly negative consequences are mostly not taken into account at all. The official version is that through a number of strategic concessions to China, the US managed to worsen Sino-Soviet relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among these concessions, it is worth paying special attention to the unprecedented betrayal by the US of its official ally at that time, the Republic of China (the official name of Taiwan), which led in 1971 to the replacement of Taiwan by communist China as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, the withdrawal of US troops from the territory of Taiwan, the unilateral rupture of all US-Taiwan security agreements, and the loss of diplomatic recognition of Taiwan as an independent country not only by the US, but also by the vast majority of countries in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we add to this the comprehensive promotion of foreign direct investment in China, including from US companies, as well as the opening of China’s access to global markets, which has transformed China into the world’s largest economy, the current Chinese threat to both global security and Taiwan is a direct consequence of Kissinger’s strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, this strategy not only created new threats, but also did not lead to the results at which it was supposedly aimed. After the establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and the PRC and the withdrawal of American troops from Taiwan in 1979, Soviet-Chinese relations only began to improve. The two communist countries, which, due to ideological differences, had been in a state of acute confrontation since the late 1950s, which included direct military clashes between the parties over disputed territories in the area of Damansky Island in 1969, resolved most of the contentious issues during the 1980s and moved on to direct cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As early as 1982, in his speech in Tashkent, the leader of the Soviet Union Leonid Brezhnev expressed hope for the improvement of Sino-Soviet relations, and also emphasized that, unlike other countries, the USSR had always recognized Taiwan as part of the PRC. In the same 1982, the foreign ministers of the two countries met for the first time in 20 years. During the negotiations, the Soviet leadership was presented with three main requirements of the PRC for the normalization of bilateral relations – a reduction in the number of Soviet troops on the common borders, an end to the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia, and the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan (where the Chinese provided large-scale military assistance to the rebels long before the first American Stinger missiles appeared there in 1986). As early as 1984, the countries signed agreements on economic and technological cooperation and created a special bilateral Committee to develop this cooperation. The volume of bilateral trade doubled in the first year after the signing of the agreements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beginning of “perestroika” in the USSR did not stop the Sino-Soviet rapprochement. In 1986, the leader of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev declared his readiness to eliminate the “three obstacles” and announced a significant reduction in Soviet troops in Mongolia, their partial withdrawal from Afghanistan and promotion of the normalization of Vietnamese-Chinese relations. In February 1989, Soviet troops completely left Afghanistan, and in May of the same year, Gorbachev met with Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, after which the latter issued the directive “End the past, open the future”, which officially ended the period of geopolitical confrontation between the two countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1991, Russian-Chinese military-technical cooperation was resumed, and in 1992, not only the supply of weapons but also the transfer of sensitive technologies began. Already in the 1990s, China, thanks to this, switched from operating second-generation aircraft to fourth and fourth+, received modern anti-ship missiles and shipboard air defence systems. In 1996, the countries agreed on the licensed production of 200 Su-27s in China with the transfer of technology. And this was only the beginning. China began a confident move towards the status of the only state in the world capable of competing with the United States in the conventional field. It is noteworthy that China’s obvious efforts to modernize its military capabilities and assistance of the Russian Federation in this regard did not affect Western policy in any way - in the 1990s, Western investments in production facilities in China increased sharply (over 400 billion dollars in ten years), and in 2001 the country became a member of the World Trade Organization with virtually unlimited access to global markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;toward-a-greater-unity-between-china-and-russia&quot;&gt;…Toward a Greater Unity Between China and Russia…&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, Kissinger’s strategy not only did not destroy the Russian-Chinese alliance, but on the contrary, restored it from the ashes of a thirty-year geopolitical confrontation, and also created the prerequisites for the current economic and military power of the PRC, which would never have arisen under other conditions. It is obvious that the strategy of “reverse Kissinger” – an attempt to reduce the threat of China using this power against US interests by appeasing Russia – has even less chance of success. Moreover, “reverse Kissinger” is a direct path to further strengthening bilateral Russian-Chinese cooperation and increasing the threat of direct military conflict between the US and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the announcement by some high-ranking representatives of the new US administration of their commitment to the ideas of a “reverse Kissinger”, cooperation between Russia and China has only increased. China, which after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine took a cautious and expectant role, began to respond much more actively to Russia’s constant and insistent calls for maximum rapprochement. In 2025, the intensity of bilateral meetings at the highest level reached a historical record. In addition to the obvious defence and economic cooperation (an important element of which are joint efforts to de-dollarize the global economy and naval cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region), in the spring of 2025, agreements were reached between Russia and China on the interaction of special services (the Russian FSB and the Ministry of Public Security of the PRC), state propaganda (the Russian Ministry of Culture and the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the CPC), and even the placement of a joint nuclear facility on the Moon (Roscosmos and the China State Space Administration).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The culmination of the current dubious successes of the “reverse Kissinger” can be considered Xi Jinping’s visit to Moscow to participate in the Victory Parade in 2025, despite the fact that the Chinese side had long hesitated about expediency of the visit. During the visit, the parties signed an agreement on deepening strategic partnership, more than 20 other interstate and interdepartmental documents, and made a joint statement, in which they emphasized the further strengthening of not only military-technical, but also military cooperation, including the organization of joint sea and air patrols. President Xi also called Putin an ally in building a new world order for the first time and expressed support for the Russian Federation in the war against Ukraine, emphasizing the fairness of Russian demands on Ukraine and the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is obvious that the search for compromises with Russia and increased pressure on China only encourages the parties to get closer. In the end, there is nothing surprising in this. The main ideologist, initiator and driver of such a rapprochement, as well as the construction of a broader anti-Western coalition, which should include not only Iran and the DPRK, but also the countries of the Global South, is Russia. The leaders of the Russian Federation and Putin personally have repeatedly expressed their dissatisfaction with the existing world order, which is based on the global dominance of the United States, for decades, and demanded its revision in favour of dividing the world into spheres of influence between several “great powers”. Even in his famous interview with Tucker Carlson, which for some reason was so popular with certain American politicians and experts, Putin openly says that he believes that the United States, as a global empire, is in the process of its decline, and the American leadership should not try to resist this, but instead adapt to the reality in which new centres of geopolitical influence around China will inevitably appear, among which Russia will play an important role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As already noted, Putin is consistent in his ideas about changing the world order and has been expressing them for a long time, practically from the very beginning of his presidency. At the same time, Russia’s claim to the right to be one of the “great powers” that should divide the world into spheres of influence is based exclusively on military potential, and especially on leadership in the field of nuclear weapons. Russia, whose economy is comparable to the economy of Canada, no longer has any tools either to achieve or maintain its status as a great power, except for the military, and therefore there are no other means for this except war. The ideal situation for changing the world order in favour of the Russian Federation would be a global war, which Russia, like the Soviet Union between 1917 and 1939, not only seeks, but also encourages in every way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly, the most desirable scenario for a global war for Russia would be a war between the United States and China, which would not only weaken these two countries, but also allow Russia to more confidently focus on the European theatre. Russian analysts close to the Kremlin quite frankly state that such a scenario is desirable for Russia. In addition, it is known that Russian intelligence is actively collecting information about possible triggers for such a war, among which the conflict around Taiwan is considered the most promising. It can be assumed that Russian intelligence is not limited to collecting information about such triggers, but also actively contributes to their aggravation through its own influence agents in Taipei, Washington and Beijing. In fact, it was thanks to the work of such agents in Tokyo under the leadership of Richard Sorge, and in Washington under the leadership of Ishaq Amerov, that the Soviet Union managed to provoke Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor and, as a result, the Japanese-American war. In this context, the appointment of Dmitry Polyansky, who previously served as the head of the Russian mission in Taiwan for three years, as the first deputy representative of the Russian Federation to the UN in 2018, seems not in vain. In his new position at the UN, Polyansky has already distinguished himself with several public statements that provoke aggravation between the US and China, as well as the DPRK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;built-a-stronger-and-more-self-assured-china&quot;&gt;…Built a Stronger and More Self-Assured China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is certainly also interested in revising the existing geopolitical status quo, but unlike Russia, it has all the capabilities to achieve its goals without destroying the world order. Moreover, today China is perhaps the most competitive player precisely within the existing global rules, which it skilfully both uses and abuses. It is these rules that have allowed China to become the leading manufacturing economy in the world, on whose products all other countries depend without exception. In fact, the policy of economic isolationism pursued by President Trump is an admission of the fact that the United States is losing to China on the field that was once built for American global dominance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is not only not interested in a direct military confrontation with the West, but also in the military seizure of Taiwan. At the same time, China is deterred from using military force against Taiwan not so much by the risk of intervention in the conflict by the United States, which has not had any obligations to provide Taiwan with military assistance since 1979, as by the inevitable application of economic sanctions by the entire West in such a case, as well as the acceleration of the search for an alternative to China as a universal supplier. Unlike Russia, China has something to lose in the event of war and is not interested in spheres of influence, since it can most profitably realize its interests in a globally competitive world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of experts also agree with this assessment. Thus, in a study conducted by CSIS with the participation of 64 leading experts on China in 2023, only 11 percent of experts believed that China would seek unification with Taiwan at any cost in the next 15 years, while 44% defined the horizon as 2049, and 42% generally answered that China could wait as long as necessary, provided that such an opportunity remains. 80% of experts did not see in Chinese military manoeuvres an indicator of preparation for an immediate military solution to the Taiwan issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, in the Russia-China tandem, Russia is the one most interested in the alliance, the most aggressive in its methods, and the most maximalist in its aspirations. Russia is purposefully seeking a global war as the only way to restore its great power status and sees its war of conquest in Ukraine as a tool for destroying the existing world order, including by demonstrating the inability of either the United States or the West as a whole to be reliable security providers even in Europe. China is certainly interested in Russia weakening the West, but it itself does not seek to participate in a blatant violation of international law. After Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, China took a relatively cautious position in its interaction with Russia, primarily due to its reluctance to suffer the negative economic consequences associated with secondary sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current US position that Russia will not be punished for waging an aggressive war of conquest against Ukraine makes Russia much less toxic for cooperation with China. Moreover, the actual recognition of the possibility of capturing new territories with impunity significantly increases the risk of Chinese military aggression against Taiwan and other countries in the region, to which Russia is clearly pushing China. Thus, the joint statement of the leaders of the two countries, which was published on May 8, 2025 in Moscow, in the original version prepared by the Kremlin, contained wording on joint actions to economically and militarily contain Japan. At the request of the Chinese side, these words were removed, which once again indicates that China remains committed to the non-confrontational model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, to weaken Sino-Russian cooperation, reduce global threats, and deter China from moving from a regime of, albeit tough, competition to a regime of confrontation with the West, agreements with Russia are counterproductive. Russia in this situation is an example of behaviour undesirable for the West, which should be punished, not encouraged. The best way to deter China from crossing red lines is to demonstrate what can happen in the event of such a transition. China has something to lose and may be content with preserving the existing global status quo, where leadership is a subject of competition that does not involve the use of military force. Preventing China from moving to acute confrontation is possible and requires the United States to reach an understanding with China on several principles. The most important of these are: recognition of the need to avoid a US-China military conflict; China’s agreement to refrain from the use of military force against Taiwan; joint control over the non-proliferation of sensitive technologies (including preventing their transfer to the Russian Federation, Iran and the DPRK); maintaining global financial and trade stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reaching an understanding on these issues would not only avoid the risks of escalation but would also allow China to engage in pressure on Russia to restore European security. The Chinese leadership’s willingness to join in such pressure would likely be even greater if, along with a draft of a strategic competition agreement that would enshrine the above principles, President Xi also received reliable intelligence on Russian operations to provoke a Sino-American military conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post–7 October realignment in the Middle East has recalibrated threat perceptions and strategic opportunities for both Turkey and Israel. The recent “12-Day War” has further accelerated this shift. While both Turkey and Israel seek to maximise influence in this fluid landscape, key indicators suggest that viewing Turkey–Israel dynamics through a zero-sum lens risks fuelling strategic miscalculations and regional instability. This could intensify competition across overlapping spheres of influence – from Syria and Iraq to the Eastern Mediterranean and the South Caucasus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The characterisation of Turkey as the principal beneficiary of the recent Iran-Israel conflict – emerging unscathed while its two regional rivals engaged in direct confrontation – oversimplifies the pressures facing Ankara’s foreign and security policy. While Turkey has publicly escalated its rhetoric against Israel, this masks the complexity of its concurrent rivalry with Iran. Managing these relationships requires a hybrid approach that blends assertive public diplomacy, strategic trade considerations, and a robust counter-intelligence posture. Ankara’s response reflects less an opportunistic gain than a strategic balancing act that weighs long-term, interrelated perceptions of threat with regional aspirations. Once close allies now appear to be on a collision course – but it is crucial to discern what is real, what is calibrated for domestic audiences, and how much of the current tension may ultimately prove impermanent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-current-state-of-bilateral-relations&quot;&gt;The Current State of Bilateral Relations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite efforts to rehabilitate ties between Turkey and Israel following President Isaac Herzog’s historic state visit to Ankara in March 2022, relations nosedived as Israel’s military action in Gaza intensified following the horrific Hamas attacks on 7th October 2023, triggering a rising civilian death toll rose and a humanitarian catastrophe there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been one of the harshest critics of the current Israeli government under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. On 2 May 2024, Turkey announced full export and import restriction against Israel, citing Israeli refusal to allow Turkey to airdrop humanitarian aid. This came after an earlier export restriction imposed in April against Israel targeting 54 product groups, such as steel and cement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countering allegations that Azeri-sourced oil has continued to reach Israel via the Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline, the Turkish energy ministry has consistently denied that any oil tankers bound for Israel have left Ceyhan since the restrictions came into force last May. The Turkish Ministry of Trade also formally rejected claims that trade has continued in an official statement, describing allegations as “completely false”. For Israel, the narrative that Turkey–Israel relations persist covertly signals its imperviousness to Ankara’s declared trade embargo. Where engagement has been acknowledged by Turkish sources, it relates to technical talks held in Azerbaijan between the two sides to develop a deconfliction mechanism in Syria, after Israeli airstrikes there in March targeted three Syrian air bases that Turkish military officials were reportedly inspecting for possible use. This suggests that while political relations remain severely strained, channels of pragmatic interaction – particularly where third-party actors such as Azerbaijan or the United States have vested interests – endure. But the near-term rehabilitation of ties between Turkey and Israel remains highly unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 13 June, Ankara condemned Israel for its aggression against Iran, calling it a blatant violation of international law, but did not escalate rhetoric further – likely to retain some diplomatic flexibility and avoid a direct challenge to the US. Domestically, Israeli military unilateralism is already emboldening Turkey’s own assertive defence posture, fuelling efforts to strengthen its indigenous military capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Israel and Turkey diverge sharply in their visions for the region’s future security architecture, they share some objectives: limit the possibility of Iranian re-entrenchment in the region, particularly across Syria; and the refusal to tolerate hostile actors on their borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-regional-alliance-building-race&quot;&gt;The Regional Alliance-Building Race&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Israel and Iran, the current pause seems to be an opportunity to reframe their post-war narratives and shore up regional allies as a form of strategic deterrence. Turkey could play a role in this equation as either a spoiler or sponsor as each side lobbies regional actors in a bid to counter the fallout of their diplomatic isolation. Ankara could leverage its diplomatic influence to challenge Israel’s efforts to re-engage with Arab states – particularly in light of recent signals suggesting Israeli overtures toward Syria and Lebanon under a broader Abraham Alliance framework. Given the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza, however, and the firm stance of Saudi Arabia that normalisation with Israel cannot proceed without an irreversible step toward Palestinian statehood, Israel’s normalisation drive seems unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To counter escalatory rhetoric by some in Israel, Ankara is likely to underscore its strategic value to the US and European allies – as a NATO member, G20 economy, and (albeit stalled) EU candidate – by positioning itself as a regional actor capable of avoiding direct military entanglement while fostering space for diplomatic de-escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, Turkey’s opposition to Israeli military actions should not be misconstrued as alignment with or tacit endorsement of Iran’s nuclear ambitions. Turkey’s relationship with Iran is complex. Both states perceive themselves as regional superpowers yet have avoided direct military confrontation since the signing of the 1639 Ottoman-Safavid accord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 4 July 2025 President Recep Tayyip Erdogan attended the recent Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) summit held in Khankendi, Azerbaijan. In his first overseas trip since the conflict, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian was also there, and photographed with Erdogan and Azerbaijan President Ilhan Aliyev. The telegraphed messaging was clear – a common front at the expense of Israel. Yet while Azerbaijan, Iran and Turkey share a complex set of interests, they are not a united alliance. Azerbaijan is seen as a brotherly Turkic state by Ankara, but also received Israeli weaponry during the 2020 war with Armenia and in 2023 when Baku wrestled control over the disputed Karabagh region. In recent months, speculation has been rising that Azerbaijan may join the US-brokered Abraham Accords alliance. Such complexity is testament to blurred lines, overlapping trade interests, and transactional diplomacy, a not so hidden receding of previous “us or them” binaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-kurdish-question-in-turkey-israel-ties&quot;&gt;The Kurdish Question in Turkey-Israel Ties&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If tensions between Turkey and Israel escalate to military standoff, it will most likely spark in Syria. Ankara is unwilling to cede its influence there – whether to Iranian interference via potential sleeper cell networks or to Israeli military entrenchment. Israel sees diminished American troop presence in Syria as a win for Turkey, and a setback for Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel’s support for the Kurds, a group seen as less hostile to Israel, has amplified since the overthrow of the Iran-backed regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar called the Kurds a “natural ally” adding: “Understand that in a region where we will always be a minority –natural alliances will be with other minorities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A map of the so-called “Abraham Shield Plan”, developed by an Israeli non-governmental platform, marks the territory of the Kurdistan Regional Government in Iraq as an “Abraham Coalition Partner”, a network that also includes Egypt, Jordan and the signatories of the 2020 Abraham Accords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ankara is undoubtedly vigilant to possible attempts by Israel to promote Kurdish separatist aspirations in Iraq and Syria and seeks to prevent Kurdish factions from being exploited as a proxy or leverage against Turkey by either Israel or Iran. Turkey is currently pursuing the disarmament of the banned Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which will have ripple effects across Turkey’s borders in Iraq, Syria and Iran. Following Israel’s Operation “Rising Lion”, one speculative scenario has questioned whether sub-national ethnic insurgencies may seize on perceived regime weakness in Tehran to advance separatist goals, such as the Kurds, Azeris, or Baloch groups. This is a low-probability risk in the short term. But Turkish security planners are likely alert to the risk that PJAK, the offshoot of the PKK operating in Iran, may seek to mobilise, even in the context of the PKK’s declared intent to disarm. Should Iran seek to disrupt the PKK process in order to keep Turkey preoccupied with Kurdish militancy, it risks alienating Ankara at a moment when Tehran can ill afford further tensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-next-war&quot;&gt;The Next War?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few in the region believe the Israel–Iran conflict has reached a definitive end. History offers a cautionary parallel: the Six-Day War of 1967 was followed just six years later by the Yom Kippur War. A return to nuclear diplomacy under US pressure alongside an urgently needed political resolution for Gaza and the West Bank may reshape the current state of suspended hostility. Yet the fact that both Israel and Iran have crossed once-inviolable red lines by engaging in direct kinetic strikes suggests the threshold for future escalation has been permanently lowered. Another round of conflict remains a distinct possibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the near term, direct military confrontation between Turkey and Israel is a high severity/low probability scenario. The strategic consequences of targeting Turkey – a NATO member – would differ significantly from Israel’s campaign against Iran. Both sides are well aware of the operational complexities and potential fallout associated with military or intelligence actions, particularly given the heightened risk of miscalculation. Security planners on both sides are likely to remain cautious, recognising that any decision to escalate or undermine existing deconfliction mechanisms would carry considerable political and operational costs. Rather than direct confrontation, a more imminent risk relates to a sub-threshold conflict or “grey zone” activity between Turkey and Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the prospect of formal normalisation between Israel and either Lebanon or Syria remains highly improbable, the establishment of a functional non-aggression mechanism – particularly from the perspective of Damascus – could be transformative. For war-weary Syrians, avoiding Turkish-Israeli confrontation on their territory would represent a meaningful step toward stability and disrupt escalatory violence cycles. Short of normalisation, a type of interim “convenient understanding”, as one Israeli security analyst described it, between Syria and Isreal may be a first step. This would likely ease the intensity of rhetoric between Israel and Turkey on both sides. In the long term, the aftermath of operations against Iran could reshape both bilateral and multilateral alliances across the Middle East. Although the U.S. appears to be reasserting its unipolar influence—whether deliberately or not—lasting regional stability will depend on the active buy-in of local actors. This will inevitably call for a recalibration of the strategic triangle between Turkey, Israel, and Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite deterrence efforts, cyber threats continue to escalate, highlighting the need for greater accountability from and cost imposition on malicious actors. The U.S. 2023 National Cybersecurity Strategy emphasizes imposing costs on malicious actors and reinforcing alliances; the Republic of Korea’s (ROK) 2024 National Cybersecurity Strategy also prioritizes offensive cyber defense and global cooperation. Since 2018, U.S. Cyber Command’s “Defend Forward” policy has resulted in 40 Hunt Forward operations across 21 countries, exposing threats from major adversaries. Similarly, the European Union’s updated 2023 Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox stresses situational awareness and the importance of holding persistent threat actors accountable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attributing cyberattacks and formulating response strategies are inherently political processes shaped by national security priorities, diplomatic relations, and geopolitical considerations. Governments must balance deterrence with escalation risks, ensuring proportionality and international legitimacy. It is therefore difficult to establish a single, uniform standard for response. Nevertheless, consistent policy is necessary, as the absence of clear frameworks increases political burdens, delays decisionmaking, and results in inconsistent responses that can confuse allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A national framework for classifying cyberattack severity enhances objectivity, guiding policy decisions and facilitating mutual understanding between nations. Although South Korea has shown strong political will to respond to malicious cyber activities, it lacks a clear legal and policy framework for response procedures. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a Cyberattack Severity Classification Framework (CSCF) to objectively assess and categorize cyberattacks, supporting informed decisionmaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;purposes-of-the-cyberattack-severity-classification-framework&quot;&gt;Purposes of the Cyberattack Severity Classification Framework&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support Political Decisionmaking and Strengthen the Framework for Cost Imposition and Accountability:&lt;/strong&gt; The CSCF supports the ROK government’s political decisionmaking regarding cost imposition and accountability for malicious actors and their state sponsors at the international level. In doing so, the framework helps facilitate sustained international engagement in cyber threat mitigation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish a Basis for International Cooperation:&lt;/strong&gt; Publicly sharing a national cyberattack severity assessment framework promotes transparency. By aligning with common evaluation criteria, the CSCF supports mutual understanding, helps partners better interpret intent, and strengthens situational awareness, playing a crucial role in advancing international cooperation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study, part of a project to enhance ROK-U.S. cybersecurity cooperation, aims to classify cyberattack severity at the national level to support shared understanding and coordinated responses. It reviews government-led models and simplifies criteria around core items for clarity and efficiency. Case studies of state-sponsored cyberattacks in the United States and ROK over the past decade will test the framework’s applicability. Although the CSCF is limited by its reliance on public data, it seeks to support cost imposition efforts and to provide a foundation for international cooperation against cyber threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;national-and-international-methodologies&quot;&gt;National and International Methodologies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;presidential-policy-directive-41-ppd-41-us-cyber-incident-coordination&quot;&gt;Presidential Policy Directive 41 (PPD-41): U.S. Cyber Incident Coordination&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PPD-41 (2016) aims to enhance national security by managing and coordinating responses to significant cyber incidents. The United States defines a significant cyber incident as a group of related events, rather than a single isolated incident. PPD-41 introduces the Cyber Incident Severity Schema (CISS) to establish a unified federal understanding of incident severity, supporting coordinated national-level responses to significant incidents. CISS outlines six levels—Emergency, Severe, High, Medium, Low, and Baseline—based on the scope of the incidents and their impact on national security and public safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assessment Criteria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scope and Impact: Evaluates the level of observed or potential effects on national security, public health, critical infrastructure, the economy, and public confidence&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Observed Actions: Categorizes incidents into preparation, engagement, presence, and effect phases&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intended Consequence: Assesses attacker intent and potential damage scope&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;national-cyber-incident-scoring-system-nciss&quot;&gt;National Cyber Incident Scoring System (NCISS)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developed by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the NCISS provides a consistent method of assessing cyber incidents and prioritizing the response to them across federal agencies. It assigns risk scores to incidents, which then guide response priorities and resource allocation. However, the NCISS struggles to assess simultaneous related incidents, relying on expert judgment instead of predefined criteria, which can cause inconsistencies and reduce objectivity in assessments. The NCISS uses the same six-level severity scale outlined by the CISS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assessment Criteria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Functional Impact: Effect on organizational operations&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Observed Activity: Behavior of the threat actor&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Location of Observed Activity: Network areas where malicious activities are detected&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Actor Characteristics: Capabilities and intentions of the threat actor&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Information Impact: Sensitivity of compromised data&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recoverability: Resources required for incident recovery&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cross-Sector Dependency: Connections between critical infrastructure sectors&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Potential Impact: Scale and significance of the affected organization&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;European Union&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nis-directive-20&quot;&gt;NIS Directive 2.0&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NIS Directive 2.0 (2022) establishes a unified framework for network and information security across the European Union. It covers a wide range of critical infrastructure and essential services vital to public safety, economic stability, and national security. Entities are required to assess and report cyber incidents that cause or could cause severe operational disruptions, financial losses, or significant harm to individuals or organizations. The scope of critical infrastructure and essential services includes sectors such as energy (electricity, oil, gas, and hydrogen), transport (air, rail, water, and road), banking and financial systems, healthcare, water supply, digital infrastructure (e.g., domain name systems, content delivery networks, and cloud), information and communication technology service management, public administration, and space-related organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assessment Criteria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impact on service operations&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Financial impact&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impact on other individuals or organizations (material or nonmaterial)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Importance of affected networks and information systems to the entity’s service delivery&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Severity and technical characteristics of the cyber threat&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Extent of impact on service functionality&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Duration of the incident&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Number of affected service recipients&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whether the entity has experienced similar incidents previously&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whether the incident was due to malicious or unlawful acts&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Possibility of cross-border impacts&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cybersecurity-incident-taxonomy-cit&quot;&gt;Cybersecurity Incident Taxonomy (CIT)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU CIT, proposed by the NIS Cooperation Group in 2018, offers a standardized framework for classifying cybersecurity incidents at strategic and political levels. It aims to enhance coordination of incident response activities across the European Union and facilitate cross-border information sharing and cooperation. According to a 2022 Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) report, many European Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) or relevant bodies are utilizing the EU CIT in their processes. Notably, Estonia has adopted the EU CIT as a national model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assessment Criteria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Attack Target: Sector affected by the cyberattack (e.g., energy, transport, finance, healthcare, water, digital infrastructure, government services)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Threat Severity: Technical risk level of the threat&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impact Severity: Societal or economic damage level&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cyber-diplomacy-toolbox-cdt&quot;&gt;Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox (CDT)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CDT is an EU framework designed to prevent, deter, and respond to malicious cyber activities, promoting solidarity and mutual support among member states. The CDT emphasizes the importance of shared situational awareness and information sharing among EU member states, aiming to improve the understanding of the European Union’s threat environment and encourage the use of the CDT to support decisionmaking. It strengthens coordinated strategies to counter persistent cyber threat actors, reinforces the international obligation of due diligence, and introduces additional response options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;categorization-model-for-cyber-incidents-cmci&quot;&gt;Categorization Model for Cyber Incidents (CMCI)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United Kingdom’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) in 2023 used the CMCI to classify cyber incidents based on severity and potential impact. It ensures effective resource allocation and response coordination across sectors, including government, critical infrastructure, businesses, and individuals. The NCSC and National Crime Agency (NCA) oversee assessments. Severity levels are classified into six tiers, similar to the U.S. CISS model, based on the scope of affected targets (e.g., nation, institution, individual) and the level of socioeconomic impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assessment Criteria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;National Security Impact: Disruptions to essential services, potential harm to life or national security&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scale of Disruption: Level of interference in services or operations&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Economic and Social Impact: Financial losses, data breaches, privacy violations, and social consequences&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Attack Target: Categorizes affected entities such as critical infrastructure, government, enterprises, small- and medium-sized enterprises, and individuals&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cyber-regulations-2020-cr&quot;&gt;Cyber Regulations 2020 (CR)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cyber Regulations 2020 were established under the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 to counter cyber activities threatening the United Kingdom’s integrity, economy, and security. These regulations allow the United Kingdom to impose sanctions on individuals or entities involved in cyber threats, including asset freezes and travel bans. Although the regulation does not explicitly define assessment criteria, it outlines the definition of relevant cyber activity and types of cyber activities, which form the basis of the assessment criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assessment Criteria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intent: Whether the attack aimed to cause harm&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scope of Impact: Number of affected people or systems&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Target: Whether the attack was on critical infrastructure or essential services&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;France&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;national-cyber-attack-classification-scheme-ncacs&quot;&gt;National Cyber Attack Classification Scheme (NCACS)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France’s Cyber Review (2018) introduced a cyberattack classification system to enhance threat assessment and response coordination. The NCACS highlights the need for a clear understanding of cyberattacks and rapid analysis of attack techniques for proportionate responses. Its classification scheme aims to enhance shared understanding, support decisionmaking, and promote international cooperation on cross-border incidents. The framework prioritizes impact-based evaluations, covering completed or imminent attacks that require urgent responses. Severity levels, compatible with the U.S. CISS, are classified into six tiers based on the scope and impact of cyber incidents. However, the NCACS incorporates international legal considerations, including the possibility of an armed attack under UN Charter Article 51, with the most severe level designated as “possibly assessable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assessment Criteria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impact: Effect on national interests, security, the economy, and the environment&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Technical Capability: Attack sophistication and methods used&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intent: Motivations behind the attack&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Target Risk: The affected entity’s significance&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scale: Attack severity and widespread effects&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Repetition: Frequency and relation to past incidents&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Canada&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;government-cyber-security-event-management-plan-gc-csemp&quot;&gt;Government Cyber Security Event Management Plan (GC CSEMP)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canada’s Federal Cyber Incident Response Plan differentiates between general and critical incidents, with critical incidents addressed under the GC CSEMP (2023). The GC CSEMP ensures coordinated cyber incident management across government systems, led by the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security and the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat’s Office of the Chief Information Officer (TBS-OCIO). It includes the Injury Test, which assesses cyber incident severity and scope, and the Risk Assessment, which evaluates potential exposure. This report focuses on the Injury Test, which sorts incidents into four levels based on their scope and severity. Each level is defined by the extent of damage across five areas—public health, financial loss, government services, national security, and reputation—to provide clearer understanding of the attack’s severity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assessment Criteria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Severity: Degree of harm across domains such as public health, financial loss, government services, national sovereignty, national security, and reputation&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scope: Extent of impact in terms of the number of affected individuals, organizations, facilities, or systems; the geographic area (e.g., international, national, multiple sectors, single sector or jurisdiction, individual or small business); and the duration&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Australia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cyber-incident-categorization-matrix-cicm&quot;&gt;Cyber Incident Categorization Matrix (CICM)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) developed the CICM to prioritize incident response and ensure appropriate measures. Continuously updated, it is used by the Australian Cyber Security Centre to classify and manage cyber incidents effectively, as well as provide annual cyber incident statistics. Severity levels are classified into six tiers based on the intensity of cyber effects and the significance of the affected organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assessment Criteria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cyber Effect: Evaluates impact based on attack success, persistence, and intent (e.g., disruption to critical systems, broad or localized compromise, coordinated or isolated low-level attacks, or failed attacks)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Significance: Assesses the importance of affected organizations (e.g., the general public, small to large organizations, educational and research institutions, local to federal governments, critical infrastructure, and national security systems)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;China&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cybersecurity-incident-classification-guide&quot;&gt;Cybersecurity Incident Classification Guide&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To standardize incident reporting and enhance security, China issued the Cybersecurity Incident Reporting Administrative Measures Draft (2023) under the Cybersecurity Law, defining severity levels and standardizing response procedures for government agencies, critical infrastructure operators, and network service providers. Similarly to GC CSEMP, severity is classified into four levels whose severity is defined across five dimensions—system disruption, data leakage, social impact, economic loss, and harmful information spread—to support rapid decisionmaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assessment Criteria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;System Loss and Functional Disruption: Network failures affecting critical operations&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Information Leakage and Data Loss: Exposure of state secrets and sensitive information&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Social Impact: Number of affected people and essential service users&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Economic Loss: Direct financial damage&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Harmful Information Spread: Dissemination of illegal or harmful content&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summary and Comparison&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-characteristics-of-national-frameworks&quot;&gt;Key Characteristics of National Frameworks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States assesses cyber incident severity through the CISS framework, integrating PPD-41 and the NCISS. The NCISS uses a quantitative, weighted scoring system to promote consistent assessment practices across the federal government and critical infrastructure sectors. CISA conducts evaluations based on reports from affected entities to ensure consistency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union classifies incidents via the NIS Directive, CIT, and CDT, sharing core criteria. The CIT, adopted by some member states like Estonia, supports standardized classification and information sharing. Both the NIS Directive and CIT classify attacks on critical infrastructure and essential services as critical threats, clearly identifying relevant sectors and applying broad coverage. One limitation is that these guidelines—particularly the CIT and CDT—are non-binding recommendations, and therefore not applied consistently across all EU member states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United Kingdom classifies cyber incidents through the CMCI and Cyber Regulation, which evaluate attack targets as well as economic, operational, and social impact. The sanctions regulation also considers attacker intent (malicious or unlawful) to ensure accountability and cost imposition on threat actors. Similar to the U.S. system, the NCSC and NCA carry out categorization to promote consistent assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France employs cyber incident severity classification to support proportionate responses to malicious activities, emphasizing situational awareness and international cooperation. The NCACS is designed to be compatible with the U.S. CISS, aiming to enhance mutual understanding of cyber threat levels in the context of international coordination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canada’s GC CSEMP assesses threats and risks using a matrix-based system to determine response levels. Similarly to the United Kingdom, Canada classifies attack targets by scale and considers the transnational scope of incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia’s CICM prioritizes victim importance and impact, using a simplified approach. The government maintains and updates its matrix, publishing annual statistics on the severity of cyber incidents in Australia to enhance awareness. The 2023 update categorizes impact by scope, focusing on supply chains, shared services, and critical infrastructure. Australia’s framework remains adaptive to changing cyber threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has introduced a cyber incident classification guide and is developing supporting legislation. While it is similar to international models in most assessment criteria, China’s system emphasizes controlling harmful information, in line with state information policies. The framework includes quantitative standards, enabling rapid identification and reporting of major cyber incidents, though the basis for these standards is not explicitly provided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;core-criteria&quot;&gt;Core Criteria&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across countries, cyber incident assessment criteria generally outline three tiers of importance. Core criteria—such as the scope and importance of the target; attacker intent; impacts on operations, the economy, society, and national security; potential loss of life; and scale and duration—are prioritized in most frameworks. Frequently considered but less emphasized are secondary factors like technical capabilities and incident frequency. Finally, other factors—such as infrastructure dependencies, attack success, harmful information dissemination, and recoverability—are selectively used depending on the context and purpose of the assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While national goals vary, many countries acknowledge the value of severity classification frameworks for crisis response, resource allocation, and international cooperation. Notably, models like the European Union’s CDT, the United Kingdom’s regulatory framework, and France’s NCACS show how classification can support accountability and diplomatic engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/onHiwTA.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: Comparison of Assessment Criteria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cyberattack-severity-classification-framework-cscf&quot;&gt;Cyberattack Severity Classification Framework (CSCF)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;assessment-criteria&quot;&gt;Assessment Criteria&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CSCF criteria are based on international frameworks and focus on core criteria to improve efficiency and consistency. While international models incorporate a wider range of factors, this framework prioritizes core criteria by grouping them into three main categories—attack target, attacker intent, and impact—comprising a total of seven sub-criteria, all organized into three levels for simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attack Target&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. Scope&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This assesses scope by affected entity range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;High: Nationwide or multinational impact&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Medium: Regional or multi-organization impact&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Low: Localized or single-organization impact&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. Importance of Affected Targets&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This assesses the criticality and sensitivity of the affected organizations and systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;High: Organizations crucial to national security, such as critical infrastructure or government agencies, based on the critical infrastructure sectors defined by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the ROK’s Act on the Protection of Information and Communications Infrastructure&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Medium: Large-scale private sector organizations, including major enterprises. The criteria for defining large enterprises in the ROK and the United States are as follows (though they may differ by industry in both countries):&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;South Korea: Large-scale enterprises are defined by the Korean government as organizations with total assets exceeding 10 trillion KRW.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;United States: Large enterprises are generally defined as those with more than 500 employees or annual revenue exceeding $47 million, according to the Small Business Administration (SBA).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Low: Smaller organizations or those with limited national significance&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attacker Intent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3. Intent&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This assesses the goals and motivations of the attacker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;High: Goal-oriented attackers—including state-sponsored groups or international hacking organizations—conducting long-term operations for political or economic gain&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Medium: Criminal actors pursuing monetary gains&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Low: Opportunistic or unintentional actors with no clear objectives&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;4. Functional Impact&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This assesses the disruption or degradation of critical functions and services. Time thresholds, such as the recovery time objective (RTO) or maximum tolerable downtime (MTD), are used as benchmarks. The time thresholds may vary depending on the importance of the organization and system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;High: Significant damage or prolonged interruptions, such as system downtimes exceeding the RTO or MTD&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;South Korea: The RTO for critical government systems can be set within three hours. The Ministry of Interior and Safety in South Korea has set the MTD for government systems at three hours.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;United States: The RTO for national or mission-essential functions is generally set within 12 hours. According to NIST Special Publication 800-34 Rev. 1 (Contingency Planning Guide for Federal Information Systems), the recovery time for functions that are national, primary, or mission-essential must be within 12 hours to ensure operational continuity.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Medium: Partial damage or interruptions, such as disruptions contained within the RTO or MTD limit&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Low: Minor or no impact on functions and services&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;5. Information Impact&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This assesses the compromise of data integrity, confidentiality, or availability:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;High: Breach of classified or sensitive information&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Medium: Breach of non-classified or general information&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Low: Minor or no impact on information&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;6. Economic Impact&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This assesses the financial and economic damage caused by cyberattacks. The thresholds used are reference values informed by the U.S. CISA report Cost of a Cyber Incident, which systematically analyzes financial impacts (with a methodology detailed in Appendix A of this paper).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;High&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;South Korea: Financial loss exceeding 20 billion KRW (approximately $15.7 million) or affected population of more than 10 million individuals&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;United States: Financial loss exceeding $157 million or an affected population of more than 72 million individuals&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Medium&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;South Korea: Financial loss between 5 billion and 20 billion KRW (approximately $4 million to $15.7 million) or affected population of 1–10 million individuals&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;United States: Financial loss between $40 million and $157 million or an affected population of 8–72 million individuals&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Low&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;South Korea: Financial loss below 5 billion KRW (approximately $4 million) or an affected population of fewer than 1 million individuals&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;United States: Financial loss below $40 million or an affected population of fewer than 8 million individuals&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;7. Political and Social Impact&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This considers the implications for national security, reputation, public relations, and societal responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;High: Severe impacts, including extensive media coverage, significant social media backlash, substantial drops in presidential approval ratings, or a decline in international trust indices&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Medium: Moderate impacts with notable effects on public perception or international relations&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Low: Minor or localized effects with limited public attention&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;weighting-of-assessment-criteria&quot;&gt;Weighting of Assessment Criteria&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Tallinn Manual 2.0, a cyber operation’s classification as a use of force or severe attack depends on scale, effects, and target. And the UN GGE and OEWG, two international initiatives on cyberspace norms, emphasize that attacks on critical infrastructure pose significant risks and are considered particularly severe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A survey conducted by the OSCE identified impact and damage scale as the most critical criteria for assessing cyberattacks, followed by attack target. Similarly, a 2022 survey by the National Security Research Institute (NSR) in South Korea found that experts ranked attack sector, importance of the damaged system, and damage scale as the top factors influencing cyber severity assessments (detailed in Appendix B of this paper).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This prioritization aligns with a broader consensus that cyberattack assessments should focus on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impact, including social, functional, and economic consequences&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Target, especially when critical infrastructure is affected&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CSCF reflects importance by letting the number of items in each category influence the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scoring-and-severity-levels&quot;&gt;Scoring and Severity Levels&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CSCF determines severity by assigning scores to assessment criteria, with a maximum score of 35 points. Each criterion is scored on a three-tier scale based on severity: High (4–5 points), Medium (2–3 points), and Low (0–1 point). The framework uses the total score across all criteria to categorize cyber incidents into six severity levels—Normal, Low, Medium, High, Severe, and Critical—aligning with the CISS used in the United States and France. The United Kingdom and Australia also follow a similar six-tier classification model. Using comparable severity levels helps promote mutual understanding of assessment results among nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/BeUCN0h.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 2: Cyberattack Severity Level&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cumulative-effects&quot;&gt;Cumulative Effects&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyberattacks from major adversarial states are often parts of broader strategic campaigns rather than isolated incidents. These operations typically unfold within the “gray zone,” staying below the threshold of armed conflict to avoid direct retaliation. Attackers employ long-term reconnaissance and persistent access, expanding their targets from individual systems to interconnected networks to achieve their strategic objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assessing cyber incidents in isolation risks underestimating their intent and cumulative effect. To address this, viewing a cyberattack as part of a broader campaign not only strengthens the assessor’s ability to make political attributions but also provides a deeper understanding of the attacker’s strategic objectives and operational patterns. In line with this, U.S. PPD-41 recognizes that a series of related incidents with cumulative effects may qualify as a Significant Cyber Incident, and NATO’s 2021 Comprehensive Cyber Defence Policy acknowledges that such activities could, under certain conditions, be classified as an armed attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Integrating cumulative effects into the severity assessment process also helps mitigate a key limitation of the CSCF: the potential perception that low-level or sub-threshold attacks will go unaddressed. By accounting for the cumulative effect of recurring or persistent malicious activity, the framework conveys that even seemingly minor incidents may be evaluated and incorporated into broader strategic assessments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To evaluate cumulative effects, a composite approach should be applied across the assessment criteria. For each criterion, the scope should be aggregated across incidents; the importance of affected targets should be assessed based on the most critical target; intent should reflect the most hostile objective; and impacts should be accumulated to reflect the overall effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;case-studies&quot;&gt;Case Studies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper’s case study applied the CSCF to 21 cyberattacks over the past decade, primarily targeting the ROK and United States, focusing on critical infrastructure and state-sponsored hacking activities. The results are presented in Table 3. While the initial assessment covered 21 cases, 2 incidents were re-evaluated by applying cumulative effect, bringing the total to 23 entries in the table. Entries 1 through 8 correspond to the ROK and 9 through 20 to the United States. Entry 21 involves a German target, included for cumulative analysis, while entries 22 and 23 reflect re-assessed cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assessment presents EuRepoC’s cyber intensity and impact scores as a comparative benchmark to provide context for the CSCF results. Where EuRepoC scores are unavailable, the corresponding table entries are marked as blank. EuRepoC, an open-access database supported by EU member state governments, measures cyber intensity based on direct effects and sociopolitical severity, while its impact indicator evaluates broader consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EuRepoC’s cyber intensity is categorized into three levels:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1–5: Low/Moderate (Green); 6–10: High (Yellow); 11–15: Very High (Red)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Impact is classified into five levels:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1–5: Minor (White); 6–10: Low (Green); 11–15: Medium (Yellow); 16–20: High (Orange); 21–25: Very High (Red)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In South Korea, cyberattacks ranged from Medium to High severity according to the CSCF, with cases like the KHNP Hacking (Entry 1) and the Pyeongchang Olympics Hacking (Entry 3) showing notable social and political impact. Although the KHNP Hacking caused limited direct disruption, it triggered public alarm by targeting nuclear facilities, and led to the development of South Korea’s cybersecurity strategy. It was classified as High severity under the CSCF. However, according to EuRepoC, both cases were rated within the Low/Moderate intensity range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korean hacking groups were responsible for the most severe attacks on South Korea, particularly the 2023 Andariel IT Company Breach (Entry 7) and the 2024 Defense Contractor Breach (Entry 8), both of which targeted military intelligence and defense technology. The Defense Contractor Breach received the highest scores under the CSCF due to its significant informational and social impact. In contrast, according to EuRepoC, Entry 7 was rated as Low/Moderate in intensity and Low in impact, while Entry 8 was assessed as High in intensity but still rated as Low in impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States, facing more frequent and severe cyber threats compared to South Korea, exhibited higher severity levels in CSCF-based assessments, with attacks classified as Medium to Severe. High-profile cases such as SolarWinds (Entry 13), Colonial Pipeline (Entry 17), Volt Typhoon (Entry 18), and Salt Typhoon (Entry 19) reached Severe under the CSCF due to their impact on national security and critical infrastructure. Additionally, the Hive Ransomware Attack (Entry 14) was rated Severe according to the CSCF, since it caused significant financial and operational disruptions. In contrast, according to EuRepoC, the Hive Ransomware Attack was rated as Low/Moderate in intensity and Low in impact. For the remaining cases, while some were assessed as High in intensity, all were rated Medium or lower in impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cases in which cumulative effect is applicable under the CSCF include the 2022 Defense Manufacturer Attack (Entry 6), and the 2024 Defense Contractor Breach (Entry 8), both by North Korean groups targeting South Korean defense contractors; and the 2024 Diehl Defense Breach (Entry 21) involving a German missile supplier, which also fits this pattern. Though individually limited, their cumulative effect within the “North Korea Defense Breach Campaign” justifies a reclassification to Severe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2015–2016 DNC hacking incidents (Entry 10) in the United States are attributed to Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear as part of Russia’s election interference efforts. Along with the post-election spear-phishing attacks (Entry 11) by the same threat actors and with the same political aim, these incidents can be collectively referred to as the “Russian U.S. Election Interference Campaign.” When assessed as a broader campaign, the impact increases and may justify a Severe classification under the CSCF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the CSCF and EuRepoC showed a similar relative ranking of cases—those rated highly under the CSCF generally also received higher ratings under EuRepoC. However, EuRepoC tended to assign lower absolute intensity and impact scores compared to the CSCF. This alignment in severity levels was slightly closer in U.S. cases, while ROK cases showed some differences, likely due to EuRepoC’s EU-centric focus on large-scale impacts. Since political and economic impacts vary by national context, frameworks like the CSCF—which present reference points informed by such context—are better suited to national-level assessment. In particular, because the importance of the attack target is a critical factor in national security considerations, the CSCF has enabled more appropriate severity assessments in such contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CSCF provides a systematic framework for assessing cyberattack severity, thereby enhancing situational awareness and supporting the ROK government’s political decisionmaking. It promotes international understanding, facilitates national cost imposition efforts, and supports joint responses. This approach aligns with the strategic goals of the ROK-U.S. Cybersecurity Cooperation Framework, which emphasizes countering and deterring malicious cyber activities while holding responsible states accountable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CSCF was developed through comparative analysis to identify core criteria and organize them into three categories: impact, target scope, and intent. The framework also offers detailed sub-criteria with reference points based on publicly available data. When applied to cases, high-profile incidents such as the Volt Typhoon and Salt Typhoon were classified as Severe, effectively capturing their national security implications. Moreover, when multiple attacks by the same hacking group with similar objectives were assessed cumulatively as part of a single campaign—such as the North Korea Defense Breach Campaign—the attacks’ severity levels increased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case study results underscore the need for a national-level classification framework that reflects country-specific contexts. The CSCF is particularly well-suited for evaluating the severity of cyberattacks in South Korea, especially from a national security perspective. Such a framework enhances understanding of domestic cyber incident severity and can serve as a foundation for improving mutual understanding in the context of future ROK-U.S. cybersecurity cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyberattacks have grown in scale and complexity over the past two decades. Unlike traditional military deterrence, deterrence in the cyber domain lacks clear red lines and established response thresholds, and allows a degree of anonymity. As a result, few cyberattacks have led to meaningful consequences, and major threat actors continue to exploit cyber capabilities. Therefore, active national-level responses that impose costs and ensure accountability are essential. Ultimately, response depends on national resolve, operational capacity, and coordinated action among like-minded nations. Nevertheless, continued research is needed not only to support political decisionmaking but also to foster international consensus. In addition, ensuring consistent assessments requires a dedicated agency for ongoing evaluations—as seen in the United States and United Kingdom—highlighting the need for a similar system in the ROK. Such an agency should share assessment results with stakeholders and foster a unified understanding of cyberattack severity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When countries design their cyber defense strategies, they do so on the premise that they can defend against malicious cyber operations only after the impacts of such acts materialize. Instead of taking this reactive posture, however, the United States spearheaded a paradigm shift to a proactive posture in 2018, when the Department of Defense (DOD) developed the “Defend Forward” strategy. This posture has since been maintained in the United States, and was reaffirmed in the introduction of the 2023 Department of Defense Cyber Strategy. Variations on this approach have been adopted by some countries, including the Republic of Korea (ROK). South Korea introduced a proactive approach to cyber defense in its 2024 National Cybersecurity Strategy, some aspects of which mirror the DOD’s Defend Forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proactive cyber defense is just one option available to countries responding to cyber threats. In general, response options are various and can be structured with a range of typologies. For instance, options can diverge into defensive and offensive responses; defensive responses, in turn, can be classified as either reactive or proactive. Public attribution and countermeasures under international law are examples of reactive defense; proactive defense can include active cyber defense and other threat-hunting activities. In certain circumstances, alternatives to proactive cyber defense can be more effective. This paper is based on this conceptualization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For proactive defense, countries need to glean insights into adversaries’ acts in cyberspace before their impacts reach the intended targets. These insights are mostly embedded in physical infrastructures that adversaries exploit for malicious cyber operations—facilities primarily located in foreign territories. That is why working with allies and partners is crucial for proactive cyber defense. Fortunately, South Korea and the United States have made a great effort to cooperate in this space over the last few years. Such cooperation is primarily based on the alliance between the two countries. This paper aims to explore areas in which South Korea and the United States must deepen their collaboration to bolster their proactiveness in cyber defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;moving-toward-a-proactive-posture&quot;&gt;Moving Toward a Proactive Posture&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2019 National Cybersecurity Strategy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2019, the administration of former South Korean President Moon Jae-in unveiled South Korea’s first National Cybersecurity Strategy. The defensive stance outlined in the 2019 strategy can be characterized as reactive rather than proactive. The strategy’s second strategic task, “enhancement of cyberattack response capability,” offers a glimpse into this reactive stance. According to the 2019 National Cybersecurity Basic Plan, an implementation plan of the 2019 strategy, the administration, with a view to enforce cyberattack response capabilities, undertakes to (i) secure cyber deterrence by managing vulnerabilities and taking steps for attribution; (ii) fortify readiness against massive cyberattacks by revamping the framework for national response and developing cyberattack detection technologies; (iii) seek comprehensive and active means of response through international cooperation with like-minded partners and reinforcement of cyber warfare capacities; and (iv) improve cybercrime response by enhancing investigation and prosecution capabilities. In sum, the 2019 strategy appears to have been crafted without consideration of the proactive defense concept. The 2019 strategy is significant in that it represented the first-ever national cybersecurity strategy in South Korea and established a governance framework where the National Security Office of the Blue House took the lead in national cybersecurity. However, its strategic ideas concerning cyber defense seem to have remained at a rudimentary stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2024 National Cybersecurity Strategy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2024, then-President Yoon Suk Yeol’s administration made public the second National Cybersecurity Strategy, which shifted South Korea’s approach to an offensive posture. In the 2024 strategy, the country set the “development of offensive cyber defense and response capabilities” as one of three primary objectives crucial to fulfilling its strategic vision of acting as a “global pivotal state.” To that end, South Korea set forth five strategic tasks, one of which is “enhancing offensive cyber defense activities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the 2024 strategy calls its defensive posture “offensive cyber defense,” the strategy’s posture is not so offensive that such naming is necessary, particularly considering the subtasks that South Korea is indeed planning to carry out to fortify “offensive cyber defense.” The strategy’s subtasks are specified in the National Cybersecurity Basic Plan, which details the activities that the administration intends to implement in pursuit of offensive cyber defense. These include establishing public attribution; tracing threat actors’ cyber infrastructure; issuing joint advisories; and collecting and analyzing threat intelligence over attack origins, among other things. Although some of these subtasks may have offensive elements, these activities do not comfortably fit under the term “offensive.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, inadequate naming could give rise to mischaracterization and misinterpretation, and thus escalation. It is hard to draw a clear line between the defensive and the offensive in cyberspace. In the spectrum of cyber activities, purely defensive actions such as firewall protections sit at one end, while offensive operations to destruct or destroy targets sit at the other end. It is hard to tell where on this spectrum the administration’s “offensive cyber defense” sits. Given this, use of the term “offensive” may risk signaling that South Korea would resort to the spectrum’s offensive extreme, which is not the intention reflected in the strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to enhance offensive cyber defense, the Yoon administration’s strategy highlights three main activities, some of which can be regarded as reflecting a proactive approach. The first is attribution. In the strategy, South Korea stated that it will identify the perpetrators of cyberattacks that impair national security and national interests by mobilizing the legal and technical capabilities necessary for attribution. The country also emphasized that it will use scientific evidence to identify actors behind cyberattacks and hold them accountable for their malicious behavior. To this end, South Korea is set to establish a procedure and standard for attribution and employ it to build a foundation for international cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second activity highlighted in the strategy is the strengthening of joint deterrence with partner countries. The administration seeks to maximize deterrence of threat actors through the issuance of joint cybersecurity advisories, which South Korea has actively issued with partners over the last few years. For instance, in July 2024, South Korea issued a joint cybersecurity advisory on APT40—a group sponsored by China—with the relevant ministries of Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In the same month, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States issued a joint security advisory on the activities of the Andariel, a hacking group under the Reconnaissance General Bureau of North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third activity is preemptive and proactive response through active detection and attack origin analysis. This reflects an approach similar to the United States’ Defend Forward. South Korea’s strategy gives its intelligence agency and its military a preemptive and proactive mission to detect and analyze the sources of cyberattacks, catch signs of attacks in advance, and quickly share information with relevant ministries. To implement this, the 2024 National Cybersecurity Basic Plan states that South Korea will develop technologies to identify threat actors and track their bases, infrastructure, and activities. Notably, there is a nuanced difference between attribution and the identification of the source of a cyberattack. The former is a procedure necessary to impose responsibility—i.e., legal or political costs—on persons or states conducting malicious acts in cyberspace. On the other hand, the purpose of source identification is to proactively track down the source of the attack before the intended target is affected, reducing the impact (if any) on the target’s network. With this third element, South Korea can be seen as taking a step toward proactive cyber defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;organizational-framework-and-proactive-cyber-defense&quot;&gt;Organizational Framework and Proactive Cyber Defense&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In South Korea, the National Security Office (NSO) is responsible for coordinating overall cybersecurity-related tasks as well as setting up and reviewing mid- to long-term policy directions. Under the coordination of the NSO, governmental agencies and departments carry out their respective cybersecurity-related responsibilities. In particular, the National Intelligence Service (NIS) and the Cyber Command under the Ministry of National Defense (MND) play central roles in proactive cyber defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As South Korea rearranged its cybersecurity strategy in 2024, the National Intelligence Service Act and its presidential decree, the Regulation on Cybersecurity Duty, were amended accordingly and entered into force. As a result, the NIS’s four major cybersecurity duties became more refined and streamlined. First, the NIS performs intelligence activities for national cybersecurity. That is, the NIS collects, prepares, and distributes intelligence on international hacking organizations or state-sponsored hacking groups (NIS Act, Article 4(1)(1)(e); Regulation on Cybersecurity Duty, Article 3(1)(a)). Second, the NIS takes measures to identify, deter, and block threatening cyber activities conducted by North Korea; foreign states, nationals, or organizations; transnational actors; or South Koreans affiliated with any of these entities (NIS Act, Article 4(1)(3); Regulation on Cybersecurity Duty, Article 3(1)(b)). Third, the NIS takes preventive and responsive measures against cyberattacks and threats on public entities (NIS Act, Article 4(1)(4); Regulation on Cybersecurity Duty, Article 3(2)(a)). Fourth, the NIS is entitled to establish and operate a consolidated response governance in which public and private entities jointly work to manage and respond to crises (Regulation on Cybersecurity Duty, Article 6 bis (4)). In the event of a crisis, the NIS’s National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) serves as the Cyber Threat Task Force (CTTF) tasked with responding; in times when there is no active crisis, the agency functions as the National Cyber Risk Management Unit (NCRMU).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of South Korea’s proactive cyber defense, Article 6 bis of the Regulation on Cybersecurity Duty must be highlighted. This article was newly introduced in the revised Regulation on Cybersecurity Duty in 2024. According to paragraph three of Article 6 bis, the director of the NIS may take necessary steps to proactively identify, deter, and block activities against national security and interests. Such measures under this provision may include tracking and neutralizing foreign and North Korean bases. This provision provides a legal basis for the NIS’s proactive cyber defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea’s Cyber Command also assumes cybersecurity tasks, mostly those related to national defense. The Cyber Command was established under the MND to take control of these duties in 2011 (Presidential Decree on Cyber Command, Article 1; the Cyber Command was originally established in 2010 under the Defense Intelligence Command of the Ministry of National Defense. In 2011, the Cyber Command became a unit directly subordinate to the Ministry of National Defense, per the Presidential Decree on Cyber Command enacted in that year). The Cyber Command’s duties include planning and executing cyber operations and related cybersecurity needs; developing and establishing frameworks necessary for cyber operations; and collecting, analyzing, and utilizing cyber threat intelligence (Presidential Decree on Cyber Command, Article 2). In addition, the Defense Counterintelligence Command under the MND supports cyber defense and information warfare (Presidential Decree on the Defense Counterintelligence Command, Article 4(5)).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea’s governmental structure for cybersecurity is illustrated in the graphic below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-us-approach-and-defend-forward&quot;&gt;The U.S. Approach and Defend Forward&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crux of proactiveness in the United States’ cyber defense is reflected in the “Defend Forward” posture. In 2018, the year after President Donald Trump began his first term in office, the DOD’s cyber strategy introduced Defend Forward, which represented a new approach: the idea of moving as close as possible to the origin of an adversary’s activity as a way of defending against it. Defend Forward was first introduced in the 2018 vision document of the U.S. Cyber Command: Achieve and Maintain Cyberspace Superiority: Command Vision for US Cyber Command. According to the document, the United States will defend forward to disrupt and stop malicious cyber operations—including activities below the level of armed conflict—at their origin. The United States emphasizes that although Defend Forward involves activities on the adversary’s network and not the U.S. network, this is still a defensive activity, not an offensive one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defend Forward is inextricably linked to the concept of persistent engagement. The United States introduced the philosophy of persistent engagement in recognition of the fact that Cyber Command needs to engage with enemies on an ongoing basis in order to disrupt or impair their capabilities. The goal of persistent engagement is to identify and stop overseas cyber threats before they reach the U.S. network. Persistent engagement is designed to ensure that Cyber Command’s Cyber National Mission Force takes and maintains the initiative to succeed in the daily competition with enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spirit of Defend Forward and persistent engagement is reflected in a metaphor from General Paul Nakasone, former commander of U.S. Cyber Command: “Our naval forces do not defend by staying in port, and our airpower does not remain at airfields. They patrol the seas and skies to ensure they are positioned to defend our country before our borders are crossed. The same logic applies in cyberspace.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration continuously adopted Defend Forward under Pillar II (“Disrupt and Dismantle Threat Actors”) of its 2023 National Cybersecurity Strategy. The strategic tasks in Pillar II aim to mobilize all powers to prevent malicious cyber actors from threatening national security and public safety. The United States elaborated that it would expand private sector participation in neutralizing malicious cyber activities and promote cooperation with international partners. The DOD signaled that, in line with the 2023 National Cybersecurity Strategy, it will continuously defend forward by disrupting the malicious cyber activities and degrading their supporting ecosystems. (In the same year, General Nakasone stated that “There was a huge inflection point in 2018 with the Defend Forward [strategy]. I don’t see, necessarily, a huge change in the strategy coming out.”)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;rok-and-us-cyber-defense-approaches-differences-and-commonalities&quot;&gt;ROK and U.S. Cyber Defense Approaches: Differences and Commonalities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are both shared features and divergences between the proactive cyber defense approaches of the ROK and the United States. In order to identify possible areas for cooperation between the two countries, these commonalities and differences need to be analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Differences&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the U.S. and South Korean approaches have different backgrounds. One of the underlying reasons for the United States’ paradigm shift toward a proactive posture is the failure of the U.S. cyber deterrence strategy prior to 2018. In early cybersecurity strategy formulations, the United States primarily perceived acts that reached the use-of-force threshold as severe cyber threats. However, the malicious cyber operations to that point—such as the 2014 Sony Hack, the OPM breach, and the DNC hack—had been below the level of use of force. Minor but frequently occurring cyber incidents, meanwhile, had been neglected but were having cumulative and erosive impacts on national security. Recognizing this threat landscape, the United States devised the strategies of Defend Forward and persistent engagement in order to contest daily competition in cyberspace. In contrast, South Korea’s embrace of a proactive stance is not rooted in such reflection. Rather, South Korea took note of the inherent nature of cyber threats. In short, the hyper-connectedness of cyberspace makes complete prevention and defense against cyber threats too constrained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever the origin of South Korea’s approach, it is evident that the major threats the country has experienced are not at or above the level of use of force. For instance, in May 2024, one terabyte of data from South Korea’s Supreme Court was stolen by Lazarus, North Korea’s hacking group. Yet physical and tangible damage—which would normally be calculated to assess whether an incident justifies use of force—was not caused. However, significantly sensitive personal information was leaked, including information on resident registration, marriage, and medical certificates. These types of damage could have a knock-on impact that could threaten national security. Accordingly, South Korea’s cyber defense posture must be calibrated to adequately disrupt such low-level activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, leadership frameworks for defending proactively also differ between the two countries. In the United States, a single leader serves as the director of the National Security Agency (NSA) and the commander of the U.S. Cyber Command. This dual-hatted leader coordinates Defend Forward operations by integrating intelligence. However, the roles of the South Korean NIS and Cyber Command are not integrated for the purpose of proactive cyber defense. Although the NIS’s National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) can operate a consolidated response system in which public and private entities can cooperate to manage and respond to crises (Regulation on Cybersecurity Duty, Article 6 bis (4)), this framework is primarily crisis-based, requiring a certain threshold to operate. In addition, the NIS and Cyber Command are entitled to engage in proactive defense separately under national law, although cybersecurity intelligence can be shared between them (Regulation on Cybersecurity Duty, Article 5). As a result, who takes the lead in proactive defense and how the authorities cooperate is not well-defined in South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Commonalities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both countries, intelligence collection on cyber threat sources is key for successful proactive defense. Gathering intelligence—thereby gaining insights on adversaries’ weaknesses, intentions, and capabilities—is a crucial step for defending forward as close as possible to the origin of adversary activity. In its 2024 strategy, South Korea also highlighted an intent to bolster reconnaissance and intelligence on the sources of cyberattacks. Preemptively catching indications of malicious activities by detecting and analyzing sources is underlined as one of the subtasks of proactive cyber defense. By proactively discovering adversaries’ malware and tactics and degrading their capabilities to conduct malicious cyber operations, South Korea and the United States could prevent such activities at the source before reaching their networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If threat hunting is limited within one nation’s border, the success of proactive defense is limited as well. A proactive defense posture thus necessitates partnering with foreign countries. Indeed, the United States’ Defend Forward requires the country to conduct activities outside of U.S. networks—both in allies’ and partners’ networks and in those of adversaries. Thus, the U.S. Cyber Command views partnerships as an integral component of Defend Forward. In this vein, hunt forward operations—defensive cyber operations conducted at the invitation of a host nation—must be highlighted. Upon invitation, the U.S. Cyber Command’s Cyber National Mission Force deploys a team to a host country to observe and detect malicious cyber operations there. As of March 2023, hunt forward teams had been deployed on at least 47 missions in more than 20 countries. With a view toward enhancing capabilities to collect and analyze threat intelligence, South Korea is planning to expand the exchange of threat intelligence with foreign intelligence agencies. Compared to the United States’ rich experience in partnering with other countries for proactive cyber defense, including in hunt forward operations, South Korea has limited experience in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;operationalizing-cooperation-for-proactive-cyber-defense&quot;&gt;Operationalizing Cooperation for Proactive Cyber Defense&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ROK-U.S. Alliance and Proactive Cyber Defense&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this moment, many uncertainties hang over the alliance between South Korea and the United States, as well as the paths of their respective national cybersecurity strategies. President Trump has commenced his second term in the White House and is reshaping his country’s cybersecurity resources. South Korea is currently standing in the fog of uncertainty created by this political transition. Many have cast doubts on President Trump’s willingness to promote U.S. alliances, including the partnership with South Korea. Furthermore, experts have been raising concerns that the absence of leadership in South Korea will put the ROK-U.S. alliance in peril.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the following two principles cannot be reversed. First, the principle that the ROK-U.S. alliance applies to cyberspace must stand. Fortunately, South Korea and the United States still seem to share a common understanding that their alliance—which has lasted over 70 years—must be sustained. The foreign ministers from Seoul and Tokyo and the U.S. secretary of state met in February 2025 and discussed the necessity of enhancing the strength of their countries’ alliances to ensure peace and prosperity. In addition, the United States reaffirmed its commitment to strengthening extended deterrence cooperation through the ROK-U.S. and Japan-U.S. alliances. In this vein, the Strategic Cybersecurity Cooperation Framework (SCCF), a legacy of President Yoon and President Biden, must be underscored. On April 26, 2023, the two presidents created the SCCF, signaling their agreement that the ROK-U.S. alliance applies to cyberspace. Whatever the cooperation framework, South Korea and the United States must consider this a cardinal principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the proactive posture in cyber defense must not be abandoned. Strategic thinking evolves as cyber threats evolve; accordingly, defense has been evolving from reactive to proactive as countries adapt to the nature of cyberspace. In the words of cybersecurity experts Eric Talbot Jensen and Sean Watts, “cyberspace’s structural feature of interconnectedness and its core condition of constant contact creates a strategic necessity to operate continuously in cyberspace.” This means, as General Nakasone has put it, that we must not just “wait for cyber attacks to affect” our networks. In effect, it is hard to imagine that the United States and South Korea would abandon their proactive postures and reassume reactive postures, since this would go against the evolution of strategic thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Laying Out South Korea’s Priorities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the previous analysis of the similarities and differences between the two nations’ proactive approaches, this paper suggests five major considerations for South Korea to prioritize in its cooperation with the United States. Some of these are intended for both countries, while others are priorities specifically on the South Korean side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the two nations need to think about a suitable cooperation framework for proactive cyber defense. Under the SCCF, the two countries undertook discussions of how the Mutual Defense Treaty between the United States and the Republic of Korea (MDT) applies in cyberspace. When it comes to the two countries’ cooperation on proactive cyber defense, however, the MDT’s role would be limited. That is because the provisions under the MDT largely address armed attack situations. The treaty contains only six articles that strengthen the two countries’ efforts for collective defense. Article I outlines the two countries’ commitment to the peaceful settlement of disputes and non-use of force, echoing the corresponding principles under the UN Charter. Articles II and III touch upon the two countries’ cooperation when one or both are threatened by an armed attack. Article IV regulates the right to deploy U.S. forces in the territory of South Korea. The final two articles contain miscellaneous provisions on ratification, entry into force, and termination of the treaty. As illustrated earlier in this paper, proactive defense posture has been introduced in national policy mainly due to cyber threats occurring below the use-of-force threshold. Of course, proactive cyber defense is not exclusive to low-level threats, but its necessity is most pronounced at that level. Consequently, South Korea and the United States need to pursue a cooperation mechanism that enables them to proactively defend against malicious operations, including those posed below the use-of-force level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, South Korea and the United States need to define the main threat actors against which they intend to proactively defend each other. According to the 2024 National Cybersecurity Strategy, South Korea is mainly introducing an offensive response directed at threats from North Korea. Unfortunately, the real threat landscape is a bit different. For instance, pro-Russian cyber actors conducted distributed denial-of-service (DDos) attacks against ROK governmental websites, including that of the MND, after North Korea dispatched troops to Russia. In addition, damage caused by China’s cyber operations has been increasingly acknowledged as severe. Whether or not to explicitly indicate threat actors in a policy document depends upon a nation’s strategic calculations. South Korea and the United States, however, must identify and agree upon a common threat actor against whom proactive defense can be meaningfully employed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To identify common threat actors, South Korea and the United States should be able to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of proactive defense measures against these threat actors, considering diverse elements like infrastructure footprints, geopolitical relations, and technical capabilities. Based on such assessments, South Korea and the United States could pinpoint shared threat actors against which collaborative proactive defense would yield a successful impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, South Korea and the United States must discuss how to successfully build collective inoculations of their networks. Proactive cyber defense aims to defend against malicious acts before they impact a country’s networks; to achieve such a goal, technical capabilities must be geared up well and outputs of technical analysis must be appropriately shared. At times, such technical measures for proactive hunting must be disseminated worldwide. To this end, cybersecurity advisories can be useful. By inoculating their own networks or global networks, the two countries can compete with malicious actors under more favorable conditions. Accordingly, South Korea and the United States must engage in dialogue on how to collaboratively raise their own technical capabilities and share these capabilities with the world for proactive defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, South Korea needs to rearrange its organizational framework for proactive defense and efficient intelligence sharing. Although the U.S. NSA and Cyber Command have different roles in national cybersecurity, they are directed by a single leader. This allows the United States to speedily leverage threat intelligence in cyber operations like Defend Forward. Moreover, the outputs of the command’s work during hunt forward operations are appropriately shared with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Homeland Security, and private companies. Releasing adversaries’ malware obtained during hunt forward missions to the cybersecurity community makes that malware less effective because reactive defense can be used to detect and defeat it. In this way, the United States’ proactive cyber defense can inoculate U.S. networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In South Korea, measures for proactive cyber defense are not carried out within one integrated framework. The NIS and Cyber Command are entitled to engage in proactive defense separately under national law. The consolidated response framework led by the NIS’s NCSC, in which public and private entities can cooperate, functions primarily on a crisis base. This organizational framework may hinder timely intelligence sharing among relevant agencies and private entities. Considering the advantages of the United States’ dual-hat leadership and its extensive experience in intelligence sharing, South Korea’s organizational structure must be reexamined and coordinated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifth, the legal limitations of proactive cyber defense must be explored. Proactive cyber defense entails actively detecting and analyzing the sources of malicious cyber activities. Unfortunately, these sources are physically located in other countries’ territories and subject to the sovereignty of these states. Even though the international community has not reached a common understanding of how and when a state’s territorial sovereignty can be breached through activities in cyberspace, South Korea needs to engage in proactive defense activities within these legal considerations. In this vein, South Korea may gain lessons from the United States’ “away game” experiences (operations that, like Defend Forward, involve activities outside U.S. networks). The United States’ experiences in away games are richer than those of other countries, and some of them are publicly available, with details of successful cases sometimes disclosed. South Korea may reference the United States’ legal logic in such situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As cyber threats evolve, the tools that states devise in response evolve accordingly. Proactive cyber defense is a tool that is well-adapted to cyberspace’s inherent features and threats. South Korea introduced a proactive defense posture in its 2024 National Cybersecurity Strategy, with an ultimate goal similar to the United States’ Defend Forward. The concept of proactive cyber defense requires cooperation among states, as it requires tracking traces left by malicious actors globally. Given this landscape, cooperation with the United States—the most experienced country in proactive defense—is imperative for South Korea. In conclusion, this paper, as suggested above, proposes five key areas for the two nations’ cooperation to promote proactive cyber defense. South Korea and the United States need to (i) establish a suitable cooperation framework for proactive cyber defense; (ii) define the main threat actors against which they intend to proactively defend each other; and (iii) discuss how to successfully build collective inoculations of their networks. Furthermore, South Korea needs to: (i) rearrange its organizational framework for proactive defense and efficient intelligence sharing and (ii) explore the legal limitations of proactive cyber defense.&lt;/p&gt;

But the window of opportunity is closing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;American disengagement from Ukraine has prompted European leaders to reaffirm their commitment to supporting Kyiv and emphasise the high stakes for European security. Nevertheless, European capitals are pessimistic about what can be achieved without significant American backing. In the absence of a clear European theory of victory, policy remains aimed at delaying Ukraine’s defeat without a clear vision of what Europe should be trying to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet a concerted effort by European states over the next year could lay the foundations for the enduring security of Europe; pushing Russia to a point where it will struggle to reconstitute its military sufficiently to threaten NATO for the foreseeable future. There is a closing window of opportunity within which a more dangerous future for the continent can be foreclosed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;europe-without-a-buffer-zone&quot;&gt;Europe Without a Buffer Zone&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future that dominates planning within NATO is one in which Russia imposes an outcome on Kyiv, compromising Ukraine’s independence. Having withdrawn its forces from Ukraine to put them through large scale exercises, the Russians could have a minimum viable force to threaten European states in the context of US redeployments to the Indo-Pacific within two years. Rebuilding its officer corps given extensive losses will take up to seven years, over which time the Russian military will regenerate much of its frontline equipment, so that the severity of the threat that must be balanced by NATO increases with time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Ukraine can hold on for another year, continuing to attrite Russian forces, however, then Russia may be pushed beyond its ability to readily recover. Russia is already approaching the exhaustion of its stockpiled Soviet-era armoured vehicles by the end of 2025. In 2026 the Russian Army will have to replace losses by producing new equipment. Recruitment is currently at an all-time high in Russia with between 35,000-47,000 people joining the military per month, but the bonuses needed to induce enlistment have peaked, while much of the enthusiasm to join has been driven by a perception that the war will soon be over. To keep up recruitment, Russia is already looking beyond voluntary enlistment. Russia cannot further increase payments as the Kremlin has emphasised that it will not be spending more on defence. If the war looks to be protracting, it will struggle to keep up the rate of recruitment. In terms of both equipment and personnel, the key to Russia’s ability to rebuild combat power is money, which is overwhelmingly generated through the oil and gas sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;economic-hurdles-for-russian-forces&quot;&gt;Economic Hurdles for Russian Forces&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s exposure to disruption of oil and gas exports is significant. With sanctions restricting Russia’s ability to borrow on the international market, it cannot afford to run a sustained budget deficit. Following President Donald Trump’s raft of tariff announcements, the price of oil dropped below $60 a barrel – the level against which Russia’s budget is benchmarked – causing President Putin and his defence minister to emphasise in speeches that the military would need to work within their current means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe, however, has the capacity to significantly strain Russia’s finances and thus the sustainability of the war. Most of Russia’s oil exports are moved by sea, and over 60% of that traffic flows through the Baltic Sea where they must pass through Danish waters. Sanctioning vessels associated with this trade can cause them to be de-flagged and once de-flagged Denmark could ban them from transiting its waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia would invariably seek to export oil via other ports, but limitations on available infrastructure would still see a significant decline in exports. This could be further reduced through the threat of secondary sanction to ports that receive and offload Russian oil. Russian oil represents a small fraction of these ports’ business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s economy and thus its ability to sustain the war can be further degraded through Ukraine’s long-range precision strike campaign. Many of the sub-systems used in Ukraine’s manufacture of long-range weapons are European and Europe can invest to expand supply, enabling Ukraine to target a wider range of Russian infrastructure. Resourcing the strike campaign is in many ways a win-win scenario for Europe. If Russian air defences defeat the strikes, Russia burns through its stockpiles of surface to air missiles – thereby making the conventional deterrent offered by European air forces more credible – while if the strikes succeed, they both reduce Russian revenue and its capacity to build weaponry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These effects will take time to impact Russia, but if implemented with alacrity they would confront the Kremlin with hard policy trade-offs in 2026. It would, in short, provide the basis for bringing Russia to the table to negotiate, rather than simply playing at Potemkin peace-talks in which Russia restates its maximalists demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;holding-ground-to-buy-time&quot;&gt;Holding Ground to Buy Time&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this is only possible if Ukraine can hold. At present, the rate of Russian advance is accelerating and Russia’s summer offensive is likely to put the Armed Forces of Ukraine under intense pressure. Nevertheless, most of the capabilities that Ukraine depends upon for its defence today – from drones to artillery and even aircraft – are not directly dependent upon the US. In the short-term Europe can cover most of Ukraine’s needs so long as it can purchase some critical weapons types from the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in the medium-term Europe must address fundamental weaknesses in its defence industrial base. Investment in explosives and propellent production for instance is essential, as highlighted in the UK’s recent Strategic Defence Review. The good news is that this is critical to support Ukraine and to rebuild NATO’s conventional forces so investment in this area is not wasted irrespective of how the threat develops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that US disengagement makes Europe’s security more precarious has seen understandable efforts across the continent over the past five months to try and engage with Donald Trump. This has softened some of the administration’s more abrupt actions. But it has not altered the underlying trend that the US is going to pivot from Europe. It is time the continent crafts a vision for how it can underwrite its own security and put the steps in place to realise it. That vision begins in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past January, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation issued updated guidance about North Korea’s IT labour networks, noting that they “…have been observed using artificial intelligence and face-swapping technology during video job interviews to obfuscate their true identities.” Iran, too, is finding success in augmenting its global spear-phishing and social-engineering campaigns with AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While banks and other financial institutions are increasingly supplementing their compliance and monitoring capabilities with AI, most are geared towards financial crime and sanctions evasion as it currently stands, not as it is heading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-once-was-a-question-of-emerging-technology-is-now-a-real-threat&quot;&gt;What Once was a Question of Emerging Technology is Now a Real Threat&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI is reshaping entire sectors of the global economy and changing how the world conducts business. Healthcare, manufacturing and finance, to name a few, stand to benefit from AI-enabled solutions that can make quick sense of complex data. The banking and finance sectors have been some of the earliest adopters, deploying AI tools to detect fraud, money laundering, terrorist financing and sanctions evaders. According to one recent survey of financial leaders, nearly 77% of banks have adopted or plan to adopt AI tools to augment their fraud detection, risk and compliance functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem, however, is that criminals, too, are rapidly deploying AI-enhanced tools, and with promising results. A recent study, for example, found that AI-enabled spear-phishing campaigns were nearly as effective as those generated by humans. Although exact figures are unknown, another survey suggests that a growing and significant number of fraud schemes involve the use of malicious AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This rapidly evolving landscape presents a significant challenge for global sanctions implementation and enforcement. While financial institutions and governments have invested heavily in AI to detect illicit activities, the very same technology is now being weaponised by adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-radical-evolution-of-sanctions-evasion&quot;&gt;A Radical Evolution of Sanctions Evasion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past several decades, sanctions-evasion methods have generally followed similar patterns with little in the way of significant innovation. Both North Korea and Iran heavily rely on obfuscation methods like the use of shell and front companies, falsified documentation, such as end-user certificates, and third-party countries to get around US and international sanctions. Often these methods take advantage of legal and regulatory gaps in monitoring and enforcement (for example, the use of secrecy jurisdictions) or the adoption of novel technologies. North Korea, for example, has become prolific in its virtual currency theft operations that generate revenues for its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, How are Sanctions-Evaders Adopting AI?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For one, AI can automate complex tasks, generate realistic deceptive content, and create layers of obfuscation that are significantly harder to penetrate. Most importantly, this can be accomplished at a scale and speed that most monitoring and enforcement mechanisms are unable to handle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While conventional methods of sanctions evasion, such as the use of shell corporations, document falsification, and exploitation of offshore jurisdictions, remain prevalent, AI introduces a novelty and level of obfuscation that make detection far more difficult. Manually establishing and managing hundreds of interconnected shell companies, each with unique and non-overlapping details, is a monumental task prone to human error, which investigators often exploit. AI, however, can generate and manage vast networks of synthetic entities, complete with varied digital footprints, making them appear more distinct and significantly harder to link back to a common controlling interest – overwhelming traditional investigative techniques and rule-based detection systems, which are often designed to identify known patterns of illicit behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider, for example, that one of North Korea’s largest sanctions-busting networks, Ocean Maritime Management, consisted of dozens of shell companies registered in jurisdictions across the globe. AI-enabled systems could feasibly create hundreds, if not thousands, of such networks – all mathematically optimised to avoid monitoring and enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not just shady corporate structuring – malicious AI threatens all aspects of sanctions-evasion, including trade-based sanctions and export controls. Falsifying the nature, origin or destination of goods is a common tactic in trade-based money laundering and sanctions evasion. AI can be used offensively to analyse customs codes, tariff schedules and regulatory frameworks across multiple jurisdictions to identify the most effective and efficient ways to misclassify sanctioned goods or dual-use items to avoid detection or minimise duties. Furthermore, falsifying key shipping documents, such as bills of lading, certificates of origin and packing lists is a well-established method of sanctions evasion. Generative AI – a type of artificial intelligence that creates new content, such as text, images, videos and code based on user input – can produce convincing and internally consistent sets of fraudulent documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;is-anyone-ready-for-this&quot;&gt;Is Anyone Ready For This?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past month, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which is the global standard-setter for anti-money laundering, counterterrorist financing, and counterproliferation financing standards – released a report that provides important updates on the methods that WMD proliferation networks use to source dual-use goods and technologies and access the global financial system in contravention of international sanctions. Although the report acknowledges the potential threat of AI-enabled sanctions evasion, it notes the topic is “too nascent to draw conclusions”. Unfortunately, this lack of forward thinking may impinge global counterproliferation financing efforts. According to FATF, only 16% of countries assessed are deemed to have effectively implemented recommendations related to proliferation financing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that governments, international organisations and private sector institutions currently are building and deploying AI-enabled solutions to look for sanctions-evasion now, and not how it is expected to evolve. The focus must adapt from looking for established red flags and typologies to anticipating adaptive, AI-driven obfuscation strategies that can learn from detection attempts and modify their tactics accordingly (in other words, adaptive adversarial AI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, however, several significant obstacles stand in the way of getting ahead of AI-enabled sanctions evasion. One is contending with outdated compliance and monitoring infrastructure across disparate sectors. Some jurisdictions, for example, still maintain paper-based customs monitoring systems. Many financial institutions, especially those in the developing world, still rely on individual reviews of suspicious activity. Such methods are highly vulnerable to AI-enabled attacks that can scale to levels that utterly overwhelm compliance, monitoring and enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another is finding a balance between data privacy and consumer protection on the one hand and regulations that may hamper rapid adoption of AI-enabled tools on the other hand. The Financial Action Task Force, for example, found that while the use of AI can help “public and private sectors improve the effectiveness of their risk-based implementation of the FATF Standards” such tools must remain “compatible with international standards of data protection, privacy, and cybersecurity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some jurisdictions, regulatory approaches tend to be more sectoral, relying on existing authorities to address AI-related risks within their domains. The US, for example, remains a patchwork of regulations – often inconsistent from state to state and lacking overarching Federal regulations. While critics have claimed this approach threatens consumers, others have claimed that over-regulation would stifle innovation and adoption speed, threatening America’s economic positioning with the AI sector. The European Union has taken a decidedly different approach, with its landmark AI Act, which essentially establishes a risk-based framework for AI across industries and categorizes AI systems by risk level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the question for policymakers is whether regulation will hamper or enable the ability of monitoring and enforcement systems to keep pace with the evolution of sanctions evasion, driven by adversarial AI. What we know for sure is that the era of AI-enabled sanctions evasion is here, and those that police sanctions implementation and evasion need to fundamentally rethink how they respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the June 2025 war ended, it was the peak of conflict between Israel and Iran. Until 1979, the two states had mutually beneficial relations but following the Islamic revolution this conflict has existed between them. Iran has seen Israel as its nemesis. The Iranian supreme leader Ali Khamenei and many Iranian top officials do not recognise Israel’s right to exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conflict has been a top concern for Israel, which has been especially worried about Iran’s nuclear project. Over the years Israel had attempted to slow Iran’s nuclear program before it could produce nuclear weapons, by employing covert tactics such as cyber-attacks and assassination of Iranian nuclear scientists. The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders have been warning about the threat Iran imposes. It eventually brought this recent confrontation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maj. General Eyal Zamir suggested in May 2022 a strategy against Iran. In the June 2025 war, as chief of staff, he led the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in a confrontation that started with a major Israeli attack. Israel’s spearhead was the Israeli Air Force (IAF) including its air defence, and Israel’s intelligence community. Israel launched two strikes inside Iran in 2024, which were not focused on Iran’s nuclear program but on Iran’s advanced antiaircraft batteries, the S-300, which were neutralised. Then, Israel sought a very short and limited round of confrontations. The June 2025 war was a much bigger campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran has allies and proxies across the Middle East, but Hezbollah and Hamas became much weaker after absorbing significant blows in 2024. Those groups were not involved in the more recent confrontation between Israel and Iran. The pro-Iranian groups in Iraq also stayed out of the war. Only the Houthis continued to confront Israel, but in a very limited way. The combination between the decline of Iran’s partners and the weakness of Iran’s air defences gave Israel a rare opportunity to strike. At the same time, Iran was closer than ever to producing nuclear weapons. Israel was concerned that it might be its last chance to stop Iran from having nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel managed to convince its American patron to allow Israel to hit Iran hard. The United States had provided Israel with highly valuable military and political support during the campaign and then, after more than a week of battles between Israel and Iran, the Trump administration bombed three Iranian nuclear sites. The United States had to take into account various constraints, on several levels, like the cost of the war, the need to save munitions for a possible fight with Russia and/or China, and to deal with domestic opposition to the US participating in the war – including inside the Trump administration. No wonder the United States had sought, and quite quickly managed, an end to the confrontation. Israel and Iran also had good reasons to avoid a long war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;israels-constraints&quot;&gt;Israel’s Constraints&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel has strong ties with its American patron, but the US – perhaps quite soon – may have pulled back from the June 2025 war. Israel did not want to be left alone during a tough fight with Iran. It required Israel to end the war soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel always tries to run a short war for several basic reasons, including economic ones. Israel’s economy is trying to recover from the long and highly costly war in Gaza (which costed Israel so far more than $67 billion). The June 2025 war had costed Israel hundreds of millions of dollars a day, and the cost of property damage in Israel was recently estimated at around $1.5 billion. Israel tried to adjust its economy according to the constraints of the confrontation. Yet Israel needed to end the war with Iran soon, or else its economy might have faced a major crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israelis have grown used to a state of emergency certainly since October 7, 2023, when Hamas and then Hezbollah confronted Israel. Those groups receive aid from Iran so they can fight Israel. The June 2025 war was directly between Israel and Iran. The Israeli public is exhausted after almost two years of war. They would have stood firm as long as the people believed the losses and damage they absorb are worth the outcome of the confrontation with Iran. If Israel had officially insisted its goal is to topple the Iranian regime, it would have been a tall order. The Iranian regime might have been strong enough to survive, and eventually the Israeli public would have therefore felt they are losing, in that sense. The same would have happened if the Israeli public were convinced Israel can quickly defeat Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are up to 15,000 Jews who live in Iran. They have not been harmed, but during the June 2025 war there was fear among them. If the confrontation had continued – and especially if it had escalated – the situation for Iranian Jews might have got worse. This negative change might not have been initiated by the Iranian regime, because it would have made the regime look bad, but some Iranians might have taken the law into their own hands to assault Jews. Outside the Middle East, as the war would have gone on, there would have been a growing risk that the Iranian regime or its supporters might have attacked Jewish communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel and the United States could have conducted more air strikes, adding to it raids with special forces and cyber-attacks. Israel also could have continued to assassinate leading Iranian nuclear scientists and top officials. Yet those efforts require a lot of resources and time and there is no guarantee they could have stopped Iran from producing nuclear weapons. Israel, sometimes together with the United States, already tried many of those methods during the last two decades, which only delayed Iran’s nuclear program. Israel could have also tried to assist the Iranian opposition to bring regime change in Iran, which is a complicated task that would too require a long time, and might not succeed. President Trump suggested the possibility of regime change in Iran. However, the United States might hesitate here, following its bitter experience in trying regime change in Iran’s neighbours, Iraq and Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran is more than 1,500 km away from Israel. The IAF reaches Iran, but the IAF was built to fight near Israel, not far away. Israel’s fighter-bombers: the F-15, F-16 and F-35 can use drop tanks, but the IAF needs tankers for a long fight. The IAF has a half-century-old Ram (Boeing 707) tanker aircraft that had conduced around 600 aerial refuelling missions during the recent confrontation. Yet since they were too few of those tankers some Israeli aircraft were refuelled by US tankers. Israel seeks to get the new Boeing KC-46 tankers, but before they arrive, the IAF would have struggled to keep a high rate of sorties over Iran in the long run, without significant US assistance. In addition, despite the IAF’s impressive efforts to maintain its aircraft, the IAF must operate following almost two years of fighting, with all its demands on the IAF. Its fighter-bombers are sophisticated and complicated weapon systems, but some of them have been in service for two decades or more, which could make it a challenge to keep them operational if the fight with Iran had been prolonged. Israel had to be careful not to wear down the IAF in a long confrontation with Iran, particularly if in the near future Israel faces a sudden and severe crisis, let alone a war on another front. The IAF would still have been able to fight, but the IAF would have been weaker, which might have made it difficult for the IDF to win at a low cost. Meanwhile, it is possible, if the confrontation with Iran had gone on for months, eventually one or more Israeli aircraft might have been lost. If an Israeli air crew had to abandon its plane because of Iranian anti-aircraft fire, lack of fuel, technical problems or some accident, this crew might have ended up in Iranian hands, which would have been a blow to Israeli morale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IAF does not have heavy bombers so there is a limit to how much damage the IAF could inflict. It is another important constraint in a long war. The IAF would also need all kinds of bombs if the fight had gone on. Recently the Director General of the Ministry of Defense, Maj. Gen. (res.) Amir Baram, met with the CEOs of the main defence industries and top officials from the Ministry of Defense. They discussed accelerating the production of key munition needed for a long campaign. Yet there are limits to how many bombs – or the materials to make them – Israel can produce or import. The same is true with the Israeli air defence, which might have ran out of Arrow missiles as the fight had continued. Israel might have had a serious munitions shortage, despite all the US aid in this matter. Although Iran is Israel’s main enemy, the IDF cannot spend too much ammunition in fighting Iran. Some reserve must be saved in case there is a confrontation on another front. After Israel was shocked on October 7, 2023, it must be ready for other nasty surprises that might lead to a war. The United States too has similar considerations, which can delay or reduce the amount of munitions it can deliver to Israel. The US military already has munitions shortage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is strategic, economic and military constraints would have made it hard for Israel to handle a long war, which could have happened, especially if Israel’s goals were not practical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;irans-calculations&quot;&gt;Iran’s Calculations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran has much more territory, population and natural resources than Israel. Israel’s size is around 22,000 km2 and it has 10 million people while Iran’s is more than 1,600,000 km2 and has around 90 million people and enormous natural gas and oil reserves. Israel’s gas reserves are much smaller. Despite all those advantages, Iran would have struggled to run a long fight due to several factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran could not have been sure if, when, and how much the United States would have continued to strike Iran. President Trump might have assumed Iran is so weak, that he can force it to do what he wants, by continuing to bomb it. Trump also did not forget Iran tried to assassinate him. An ongoing, let alone massive, US offensive against Iran would have changed the power of balance against Iran. Iran had to prevent that by ending the confrontation before it would have been too late for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Iranian regime might have been desperate enough, if the war had gone on, to try to close the Strait of Hormuz, where around 20 million barrels of oil pass per day, which is about 20% of global petroleum liquids consumption. Blocking those straits would seriously disrupt the oil market. The United States could break this siege by force and retaliate against Iran. This fight would have started with the Strait of Hormuz, but it could have expanded into a bigger fight that would have included striking targets all over Iran such as its nuclear sites. Over time, such escalation could have jeopardised the survival of the Iranian regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IAF gained air superiority over Iran’s skies. Iran’s air force is old and cannot match the IAF. The IAF also neutralised a large part of Iran’s air defence. Iran could not have afforded a long war in which Israel can bomb in Iran whenever and whatever it wants. This enormous advantage would have allowed Israel to strike various targets including going after senior officials, up to the supreme leader. This was a huge risk for the regime, that also humiliated it in the eyes of its people, which increased the danger they might topple it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran strikes Israel with drones, but in the last two years the IAF has gained experience in shooting them down, which was evident in the success in this action by the IDF in the June 2025 war. Iran’s main weapon, their surface-to-surface missiles, caused some casualties and damage but Israel began to destroy the launchers. To begin with, Iran had less than 2,000 missiles that could reach Israel and far fewer launchers. Since the IAF had control over the skies of Iran, despite Iran being a huge country, the IAF was able to find and hit those launchers with increasing efficacy. Iran was aware it had to end the war before it was unable to strike Israel with missiles, and by the end of the confrontation Iran was firing far fewer missiles than at the start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran’s economy depends on exporting oil. If Israel had severely crippled Iran’s oil production, Iran could have sold much less oil. For Iran, it was a very good reason to stop the war before this happens. Furthermore, the Iranian economy has been struggling for many years now, not only because of sanctions but also due to corruption, mismanagement and giving priority to foreign adventurers instead of taking care of the Iranian population. Iran has to manage enormous economic challenges such as an energy crisis, while Iran’s currency, the Rial, is at an all-time low. The Iranian regime was aware that if its economy deteriorates even more, due to losing its main income through the difficulty of selling oil, it will increase the probability of an uprising. In recent years there were several waves of demonstrations in Iran. Another outburst might be powerful enough to undermine the Iranian regime. Preventing this requires the Iranian regime to focus on improving its economy by making reforms and removing sanctions, which meant ending the war soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the confrontation had continued, European powers that signed the JCPOA might have suspected that Iran would try, secretly or not, to produce nuclear weapons after or even during the war, to protect itself from attacks. This would have raised the chances that in October, the ‘snapback’ mechanism might be implemented, reinstating UN sanctions against Iran. It was another key economic concern for Iran, adding to the pressure on her to end the war quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, from the perspective of the Iranian regime, they made huge compromises in 1988, ending the war with Iraq, and in 2015, signing the JCPOA, and they have now done another by ending the war – before the cost would have been too high for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazilian foreign policy, traditionally nonpartisan, is increasingly shaped by domestic political divides, complicating alignment with global powers. This also fuels unpredictability, especially in relation to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil’s political right is looking to align with Washington in a bipolar world order, while its political left still seeks multipolarity through the Global South and with the help of the Global East. If, contrary to many expectations and current Brazilian policy, the world becomes bipolar, Brazil may be forced to pick sides, challenging its tradition of balanced diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the world appears to be heading towards multipolarity, this would fulfil a long-held Brazilian foreign policy objective. However, Brazil faces regional dynamics that, perhaps paradoxically, resemble bipolarity, as South America remains only a secondary, or even tertiary, zone for great power competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hosting major forums like the G20, BRICS, and COP30 puts pressure on Brazil to deliver more consistent global messaging, limiting its room for strategic flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 6–7 July, the BRICS Summit will be held on Brazil’s southeastern coast, in Rio de Janeiro, sandwiched between last November’s G20 Summit in the same city and this November’s COP Summit in the Amazonian city of Belém. Brazil’s role in presiding over leading fora of multilateral diplomacy draws attention to different facets of left-wing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s policy. Lula, now serving his third term as president, has positioned Brazil as a vocal advocate for climate action, Global South cooperation, and a more multipolar world order. These platforms offer his government a chance to demonstrate global leadership and score some wins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Briefing Paper examines whether Brazil’s traditional approach – marrying the abovementioned foreign policy positions with basic alignment with the United States – remains sustainable in the face of today’s shifting global dynamics. The challenge lies not only in balancing between two powers – the US and China – but also in navigating two different international structures, bipolarity and multipolarity, at both global and regional levels. Adding to the complexity, Brazil’s outlook is also subject to major swings due to the increasingly partisan slant in its foreign policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This analysis is divided into four parts. First, Brazil’s current push for multipolarity is addressed. Second, the development of a distinctly Brazilian foreign policy vision is outlined, particularly in the context of its evolving relationship with the United States and its views on Brazil’s hemispheric and global roles. Third, this vision is examined in light of Brazil’s current objective of global multipolarity – particularly through BRICS – and its preference for multilateralism in settings such as the UN and its climate regime, the WTO, and the G20. This is also compared with India’s behaviour on both regional and global stages. Fourth, the sustainability of Brazil’s current path is assessed: a path that entails keeping Washington close enough while simultaneously pursuing a world that is not necessarily aligned with US interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil currently faces both ample opportunities for diverse partnerships and challenges in avoiding open alignment. As much as Brazil may have publicly pushed for reforming international institutions, it has been a relative beneficiary of the pre-existing rules-based order and a less divided world. Thus, this analysis concludes with the conjecture that other global powers will find it increasingly difficult to comprehend the ambiguity of Brazil’s alignment, and that Brazil itself may struggle to maintain its balancing act. European actors, in particular, would do well to study Brazil’s experience closely, both as a warning and as a model, to avoid repeating missteps or overlooking structural tensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;brazils-push-for-multipolarity&quot;&gt;Brazil’s push for multipolarity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil’s 2025 BRICS presidency got off to a flying start in January, when Indonesia joined the organization. With its 280 million people and $1.4 trillion GDP, Indonesia strengthens Brazil’s pursuit of multipolarity and its multi-aligned stance in global affairs. For Brasília, Jakarta’s accession marked a major diplomatic win and underscored Brazil’s emphasis on BRICS as a framework for cooperation in the Global South – a Global South in which Brazil sees itself as a, or the, major leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet BRICS remains divided on its basic orientation. Russia, Iran, and China openly challenge the Western-led international order, while Indonesia has now joined India and Brazil as a major multi-aligned member, one that emphasises strategic autonomy. This underlines the bloc’s strikingly diverse composition, which also includes Egypt and the United Arab Emirates – both close strategic allies of the US – while South Africa and Ethiopia, which are currently suffering from cooling relations with the United States, are the final two of the group’s fully declared ten members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia is a case in point when discussing the strategic ambiguity surrounding the group. While Brazil refers to Saudi Arabia as a member, Riyadh has neither accepted nor declined the invitation to join. For Saudi Arabia – as well as for many other BRICS partners and applicants – ambiguity remains a strategic hedge in an evolving world order. Nonetheless, the current BRICS members already account for a higher share of global GDP in terms of purchasing power parity terms than the G7 core. To make matters more interesting, this shift comes at a time when this Western rival to BRICS appears increasingly divided, as seen in its June summit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This growing juxtaposition between BRICS and the G7 raises broader questions about the structure of the international system. Brazil’s role in BRICS depends not just on the country’s partnerships, but also on how power is distributed globally. A central tension emerges here: is the world heading towards multipolarity or bipolarity? Although not taking a definitive stance on the question, this paper examines how countries may need to prepare for both scenarios. For Brazil, this question is particularly pressing, as in a more multipolar world, it may aspire to emerge as a pole of its own; in a bipolar world, it may have to choose, or at least balance, between two superpowers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this analysis, bipolarity refers to a global or regional system defined and driven by two countries. At the global level, for example, even the rapprochement between the United States and Russia can be seen as a sign of such bipolarity, as Washington seeks an understanding with Moscow that would allow it to focus more energy on Beijing. However, the very existence of such a Muscovite lever – one with the world’s largest arsenal of nuclear weapons – suggests a considerable element of multipolarity in the emerging global order, where power is distributed among several influential states rather than concentrated in two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regional dynamics complicate the picture further, as the structure of the international system can appear very different depending on the perspective. For example, India is situated at the heart of multipolarity, both in the Indo-Pacific and in Eurasia. Brazil, by contrast, is geographically removed from the hottest spots of geopolitical contestation. As a result, it is more vulnerable to the pressures of systemic bipolarity than countries located in regions shaped by several great powers. This means that Brazil must actively seek out and build multipolarity, pursuing partnerships with other actors, including parties such as the European Union. While doing so, it must also follow a path that reconciles its global ambitions with domestic and regional constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;brazil-the-us-and-the-quest-for-global-status&quot;&gt;Brazil, the US, and the quest for global status&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand Brazil’s amorphous ambitions for global leadership, it is first necessary to comprehend how its relationship with the United States has evolved. Beneath the surface of Brazil’s foreign policy discourse lies an undercurrent of jealousy that has the potential to turn into resentment: Why them and not us? Both countries are continental in scale, and Brazil also entered modernity in overdrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the Napoleonic Wars, Brazil was merely a Portuguese colony, lacking even a printing press. Then, from 1808 to 1821, the Portuguese Court ruled from Rio de Janeiro. In 1822, Brazil gained independence under an emperor, the son of the King of Portugal. The resulting Empire of Brazil had two overarching policy objectives: actualizing territorial integrity and preserving slavery in the New World, even after European kingdoms turned against the slave trade. In 1889, Brazil abolished slavery and emerged as an aristocratic republic with a predilection for localized civil war, but also continued territorial expansion, especially in the Amazon region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Brazil fought on the side of the Allies in World War I and took part in the League of Nations, its foreign policy remained largely focused on internal and regional affairs. A more multifaceted approach began to emerge in the mid-to-late 1930s, co-created with Washington in the context of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Good Neighbor Policy. Roosevelt sought a partnership with Brazil, soon convinced the country to join World War II, and in 1947, President Harry Truman signed the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance. Known as the Rio Treaty, it formalized collective defence in the Americas and helped inspire the creation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was an auspicious decade for both US-Brazil relations and Brazil’s rise as a global player. However, from the perspective of then-capital Rio de Janeiro, one crucial shortcoming stood out: Brazil failed to secure a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). Despite early US support, Brazil lacked the international recognition needed to secure the seat. This failure has shaped Brazil’s foreign policy ever since. Why did the quest fail, and how could that wrong be rectified?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quest for global status via a permanent seat on the UNSC has remained, on and off, a mainstay of Brazil’s foreign policy vision. Similarly, its relationship with the United States – with the bicentennial of diplomatic ties celebrated in 2024 – has remained a constant, if sometimes one-sided, question. Washington’s view of Brazil has shifted over time: at certain points, the US has hoped that Brazil would play a more prominent role in South America or the broader Americas, and at other times, it has found Brazil’s efforts, at best, a hindrance to its own goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proximity has not always bred harmony, and during the Cold War, for example, bilateral ties were often controversial. One notable episode was Brazil’s participation, during its military dictatorship from 1964 to 1985, in the US-led intervention in the Dominican Republic. The relationship between the two great federal republics of the Americas has alternated between cooperation and phases of Brazilian assertiveness, including the pursuit of an autonomous foreign policy and regional leadership, if not against, then at least not for the purposes of the United States. The latter tendencies were particularly pronounced during the eight years of the first and second Lula presidencies (2003–2010).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the 21st century, Brazilian foreign policy has taken an increasingly partisan turn. In recent years, the country’s political right has seen itself aligning with the United States bilaterally. For example, under hard-right President Jair Bolsonaro from 2019 to 2022, the last Trump administration designated Brazil a Major Non-NATO Ally. By contrast, Lula’s return to office has created more distance between Brasília and Washington, even though President Joe Biden intervened to help secure the Brazilian election in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With hardening partisanship, Brazil’s foreign policy vision is becoming increasingly complex. It is also shaped by the rise of a near-peer rival to the United States – China – and several international regimes built around Beijing. The most important of these is BRICS, an organization whose future is essential to Brazil’s grand strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet there is a risk. To avoid being seen as openly aligned against the United States, Brazil must succeed in portraying its BRICS engagement as cooperation within the Global South, rather than as an anteroom for entering the Global East – the bloc of countries openly challenging the United States and many of its friends and allies. As a pair of shrewd analysts have put it, the outcome of the ongoing battle for the direction of BRICS will help determine the future of the global order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;brazil-in-brics-and-beyond&quot;&gt;Brazil in BRICS and beyond&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Global South has arguably been among the greatest beneficiaries of the last quarter – if not the last half – of a century of globalization. While many countries commonly regarded as part of the Global South still struggled with a myriad of financial crises at the turn of the millennium, many of them have now not only secured seats at the tables where international policy is made but also built alternatives to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, it is useful to distinguish between the Global South, which may not be part of the Global West or North, but does not necessarily seek to challenge them, and the Global East, which increasingly does. This distinction is important for two reasons: first, there is overlap in membership between the two groups; and second, the Global East has arguably been the greatest winner of the 21st century. China’s growth is already legendary, but even under wartime sanctions, Russia’s economy has proven remarkably resilient. In recent years, the Global East has shifted from simply growing its share of the global economic pie to translating economic gains into geostrategic capabilities – a shift that has not gone unnoticed in European capitals, much less in Washington. From the first Trump administration through Joe Biden’s four years in office, the United States has sought to hamper the economic growth of not only its clear foes such as Russia, Iran, and North Korea, but also, increasingly, that of its principal systemic challenger: China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To complicate matters further, leading lights in Washington now see even the prosperity of many longstanding allies as something of a threat. This signals a shift towards a more confrontational understanding of global power and creates a challenging scenario for Brasília, regardless of who is in power – and even despite Brazil’s trade surplus with the United States. In response, President Lula has insisted that BRICS is not aimed against anyone, and therefore no country should have any reason to turn down an invitation or use the organization to its own advantage. However, others seem to see things differently. Saudi Arabia’s fence-sitting is one example, but Argentina’s outright refusal to accept an invitation to join in 2023 – following the electoral victory of Javier Milei, a right-wing president aligning the country more closely with the United States – suggests that some governments do indeed see BRICS as politically charged, or as standing in opposition to Washington and allied capitals. This also speaks to the evolution of BRIC into the so-called BRICS+, with the plus sign symbolising not only growing membership, but also expanded ambition. What began as a forum for those seeking simple recognition has evolved into economic cooperation and increasingly ventured into the realm of geopolitics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While both Brazil and India have at times resisted the expansion of BRICS and its overt geopoliticization, they have ultimately chosen to remain within the changing organization – or perhaps concluded that they have nowhere else to go. For Brazil, this became particularly apparent during its G20 presidency in 2024. Although it managed to highlight poverty and hunger – and even build an alliance around these issues – it achieved little in terms of furthering the reform of international institutions. In contrast, Brazil has devoted more of its international efforts in 2025 to BRICS, a platform increasingly associated with a more confrontational stance towards the Global West or North. The contrast is telling: as such, the G20, born of the Global Financial Crisis and an institution that has sought to balance a variety of interests, may be turning into a relic of High Globalization. BRICS, by comparison, reflects a more disruptive vision for global governance. If the G7 has continued to exist alongside the G20, then why not BRICS?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps paradoxically, emerging multipolarity, at least at the regional level, seems to be challenging multilateral governance frameworks. Brazil and India – both prominent actors in the Global South and founding members of BRICS – offer contrasting examples. While Brazil, located in a relatively peaceful area, has largely existed in a region shaped by bipolar great power dynamics – with China steadily displacing the United States in areas such as trade and finance – India is living through multipolarity in its region, surrounded by multiple nuclear-armed rivals. This is perhaps why both US and European policymakers have expressed more empathy towards India’s strategy of multi-alignment. In a tougher neighbourhood, New Delhi’s balancing strategy is approached with more understanding than Brazil’s, even when it blends increasing military cooperation with the United States with military-industrial and energy engagement with Russia, and a generally sceptical approach to world-trade regimes. Meanwhile, Brazil, despite its support for multilateralism and participation in institutions like the WTO, is afforded less leeway – even though it has clearly condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, despite some odd remarks from its presidents. Compounding this, Brazil’s economic performance has lagged, while India is on a path to overtake Japan as the world’s fourth-largest economy, possibly as early as 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Brazil’s past role as a potential bridge between the West and the Global South has become less plausible in a world where the West itself is more divided and where the United States has, once again, withdrawn from the Paris Agreement. This matters because, in late 2025, Brazil will also host the UN Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Belém, an event intended to showcase its global climate leadership. Climate diplomacy has been a central part of Brazil’s multilateral identity ever since the Rio Conventions of 1992, although the Lula government’s sustainability commitments are in tension with its interest in expanding fossil fuel exploration – including in areas near Belém, at the mouth of the Amazon River.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these contradictions, Brasília’s intention is to double down on Brazil’s legacy of leadership through multilateralism and to re-emphasise sustainability. The inclusion of Indonesia in BRICS during the first days of Brazil’s presidency suggests that its leadership in the Global South can also yield tangible results. Brasília, indeed, seems capable of moulding the world in a direction it desires. Whether that direction aligns with Washington or other Western capitals is another matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions-between-alignment-and-autonomy&quot;&gt;Conclusions: Between alignment and autonomy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can Brazil simultaneously maintain sufficient alignment with the United States while also pursuing an increasingly independent stance in the region and the world? Answers to this question are becoming increasingly contradictory and contentious. Yet Brazil’s relationship with the United States continues to influence its aspirations for both regional and global leadership. Ultimately, Brazil still needs Washington’s vote for a hypothetical permanent seat on the UNSC, and more immediately, Brasília’s interests lie in avoiding alarm over its current trajectory. But this balancing act will only become more difficult as Brazil seeks further multipolarity and asserts itself as a leader in the Global South. While Brazil’s geopolitically quiet neighbourhood has often been advantageous, it may also result in relative blindness to the outcomes and stakes of the tug-of-war between multipolarity and bipolarity. Three reflections remain on this outlook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, US-Brazil relations offer a case study on how partnerships with the US can inform broader alignment strategies, especially in the context of national foreign policy traditions breaking down along partisan lines. Brazil has been at the forefront of a recent trend of alignment based on ruling parties rather than a broader sense of national interest. As a result, US-Brazil relations now clearly fluctuate depending on who holds power in both countries. For example, if the Brazilian Right returns to power, further alignment with Trump’s United States can be expected. Such alignment would also enjoy support from a significant portion of Brazil’s increasingly ideological public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further complication lies in Brazil’s judiciary, which has constrained both the power of the country’s own executive and the influence of US tech companies. This has resulted in a major rallying cry in Washington and Silicon Valley. The European Union and its member states would do well to examine the Brazilian case to avoid some of the same pitfalls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, China’s growing influence is a reality that Brazil must navigate, especially in the realm of trade and investments. Brazil’s total exports to China are already more than double those to the United States, and within a few years, the US share may shrink to just one-third. While this means that the US trading relationship is diminishing in importance, there is a good chance that Brazil will still benefit from such a shift, as global trade tensions create new openings: US tariff policy has made China buy more soy, Japan more beef, and perhaps even France will drop its opposition to the EU-Mercosur deal. Despite never having been known for the lowest tariffs, Brazil has long supported rules-based trade, and the country is generally well-placed in Trump’s view of the trading world – with the US holding a slight surplus in bilateral trade. Still, this will be a difficult adjustment for Brazil’s foreign policy outlook. This raises a third and vital point below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In today’s geopolitical climate, Brazil may simply end up aligning against the United States, perhaps even accidentally. This could happen, for example, if Brazil continues to pursue multipolarity in a world that – contrary to most current projections – shifts towards bipolarity. Under such circumstances, the very pursuit of multipolarity could draw Brazil closer to China, the beneficiary of today’s anti-hegemonic policies. While Brazil may try to avoid unnecessary confrontation with the United States today, this is no easy task for a government that also seeks to express disagreement for the sake of what it perceives as a greater good. As Lula said during a March 2025 visit to Japan, “Trump is not the world’s sheriff – he’s only president of the United States,” adding that protectionism must be overcome if free trade is to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is clear who the main target of such a statement is, it can also be interpreted as a message to Brussels. Brazil has waited more than a quarter of a century for a trade deal with the European Union; and for just as long, it has decried Europe’s fluctuating interest in both the country and the deal. Without ratification of the EU-Mercosur agreement, Brazil’s distance from not only the United States but also from other parts of the Global West will only grow. Europe would do well to heed such calls for cooperation and build common cause with Brazil and other countries of the non-aligned – or at least less-aligned – Global South whenever possible. The recent trade agreement with Chile is a good start. But without more substantial change, Brazil may ultimately shift from a tradition of constructive diplomacy to openly challenging Western-led institutions. In such a world, the reform of global governance would not be achieved through compromise but, at best, through the ascension of the Global South or, more troublingly, the rise of the Global East. For these reasons, Europeans should also endeavour to develop a vision of global order that is ameliorative and does not run counter to their own interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, any European vision should be one that Brazil could share and one that helps tether the country to global institutions. Such an outlook would prepare the international system for a world in which Brazil may no longer be able to pursue multipolarity and maintain alignment with the United States at the same time. In a period of intensifying bipolar rivalry, Washington is likely to resume demanding clear alignment from its friends and allies – even if, at present, it is sending mixed signals about its own alliances and other commitments. As such, Brasília – and the viability of its double-edged foreign policy – is something that all global observers should watch. Luckily, Brazil has recently made this easier by assuming the presidency of several international forums. Being under the spotlight also makes it harder to practise any form of strategic ambiguity; instead, the country’s contradictions and challenges are now in plain sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since launching its full-scale invasion in February 2022, Russia has relentlessly attacked Ukraine’s energy system, along with other infrastructure. In November 2024 alone, Russia fired 350 missiles and over 2,500 drones at the Ukrainian power grid. As a result of these attacks, the total damage to the energy infrastructure—heating, power, and oil and gas—at the end of 2024 was estimated at $20.5 billion, while the cost to rebuild according to EU standards amounts to $67.8 billion. Combining the occupied, destroyed, and damaged power capacities, Ukraine has lost a total of approximately 27 gigawatts (GW) of its pre-war installed capacity of 56.1 GW. Ukrainian citizens and businesses entered recent winters with less than half of their power generation available, forcing authorities to introduce restrictions on the supply of electricity. Emergency measures—such as repairing damaged generation capacity and deploying thousands of backup diesel generators—have provided stopgaps to the current dire situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid this crisis, energy decentralization as a strategy for survival has moved to the forefront of expert discussions. Small, distributed power units, ranging from 5 to 100 megawatts (MW) each, are regarded as the only way to prevent a nationwide blackout and ensure a stable electricity supply to people and businesses. In addition, these small units are not an easy target for Russian missiles. Importantly, decentralization also aligns with Ukraine’s long-term commitment to a more sustainable and balanced energy mix. According to Ukrainian and international experts, rebuilding Ukraine’s grid on the old, centralized model with outdated coal plants and dependence on imported fuel is not an option. Instead, Ukraine has a unique opportunity to build a modern energy system relying on a more balanced and efficient mix, strengthening its future energy security and economic resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next two years are critical for Ukraine’s energy security. As Russian attacks persist, Ukraine is racing to winterize its grid and add new generation capacity. At the same time, there is significant work ahead for the Ukrainian government—both at the national and subnational levels—in terms of regulations, reforms, and incentives to address Ukraine’s energy challenges. The international donor community and foreign investors are watching developments in the country very closely, as they will be key players in achieving Ukraine’s vision. For the United States, supporting Ukraine’s energy modernization aligns with its strategic interests in the country and the broader region: It creates markets for U.S. firms, strengthens Ukraine’s resiliency, and diminishes Russia’s ability to cripple the Ukrainian economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building off prior work conducted by CSIS, this paper discusses how to rebuild Ukraine’s energy system to ensure access, strengthen security, and promote sustainability. The paper provides a description of the country’s future energy mix, the policy and regulatory reforms needed, and the role that international partners—including the United States—can play in its modernization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ukraines-future-energy-mix-outlook-and-challenges&quot;&gt;Ukraine’s Future Energy Mix: Outlook and Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine inherited a Soviet energy model, characterized by a centralized, state-owned monopoly with huge generation facilities serving the entire country. Ukraine’s power system was dominated by large nuclear, coal, and hydroelectric plants feeding a Soviet-era grid, run by state-owned companies (e.g., Energoatom for nuclear power and Ukrenergo for the grid) and a few private conglomerates, such as the Donbass Fuel-Energy Company (DTEK). Ukrenergo operates the national grid centrally, which was synchronized with the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) grid post-2022. Local generation was minimal, aside from some industrial cogeneration, and municipalities had little role in electricity beyond distribution utilities. As a result, fossil fuels and nuclear energy dominate the energy mix (see Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The centralized nature of Ukraine’s energy system has advantages such as economies of scale, better coordination, and reliance on proven technologies. However, it is vulnerable to large-scale disruptions, including grid failures or attacks, which can lead to widespread blackouts. The system also suffers from high transmission losses, as electricity must travel long distances from power plants to users. In addition, the system is inflexible and slow to adapt to changes in demand or new technologies. Building and maintaining them also requires significant investment and high capital costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/dgV8v3S.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Ukraine’s Energy Supply, 2023&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While nuclear power currently provides approximately 50 percent of electricity generation and remains a cornerstone of Ukraine’s energy system, policymakers are increasingly emphasizing the need to diversify energy sources and decentralize power generation. The aim is to reduce dependence on a few large facilities, including high-risk nuclear sites, and shift toward a more distributed, resilient mix of renewables, storage, and flexible backup sources. Experts argue that the only way to modernize the system and ensure Ukraine’s long-term survival is to build numerous local power facilities (ranging from 5 to 100 MW) instead of relying on a few large power plants. Post-invasion, there is an opportunity to allow more independent power producers and community-level generation. According to recent studies from the Energy Community and the International Energy Agency, the target energy mix for Ukraine includes adding gas and biomass units, batteries, wind, and solar photovoltaics (PV) over 10 years. If realized, this vision would significantly increase electricity capacity from varied sources by 2035, enhancing the system’s efficiency and sustainability. A more diversified energy portfolio, including fossil fuels, renewables, and nuclear power, will be essential to building a more sustainable future for Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, nevertheless, nuclear, large-scale hydroelectric, and gas-fired power will remain essential pillars of Ukraine’s base load capacity. While small-scale, distributed generation is crucial for the system’s resilience, it is equally important to recognize the role of centralized energy sources for Ukraine’s energy security. Plans are underway to construct new reactors, including small modular reactors (SMRs), to replace aging infrastructure and enhance resilience. Additionally, natural gas-fired power plants provide flexibility to balance the grid, especially during peak demand periods. Biomass and gas-fired generation would be a good addition to renewables, helping to cover evening and wintertime peaks of consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;energy-reforms-and-financing&quot;&gt;Energy Reforms and Financing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To support a more modern energy system, the Ukrainian government has enacted regulatory reforms, including tax and customs exemptions for importing energy equipment. In June 2024, Ukraine’s cabinet of ministers approved a National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) for 2025–2030, with investment needs estimated between $41.5 billion and $50 billion. The plan aims to reach 27 percent renewable energy in the final energy consumption by 2030, up from the current 10 percent. The NECP includes adding approximately 10 GW of new renewable capacity and cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 65 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. Shortly after, the government of Ukraine announced a $20 billion plan to achieve these targets—aiming to increase the share of renewables in electricity generation from the current 10 percent to 27 percent by 2030—reflecting both wartime necessity and EU Green Deal alignment. Moreover, in August 2024 the cabinet of ministers approved a Strategy for the Development of Distributed Generation until 2035, aiming to enhance grid resilience through decentralized energy solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, to enable local authorities to contribute to the modernization of the energy system, in January 2025 the Ukrainian parliament adopted Law No. 9381, which simplifies regulatory procedures and stimulates investments to build a decentralized and sustainable energy sector. The law’s provisions aim to (i) promote the development of a distributed energy system so that it is more resilient during wartime; (ii) simplify the connection of new power generation capacities, including renewable energy sources; and (iii) increase the transparency and predictability of energy projects. This law also aligns with the European Union’s Ukraine Facility requirement that 20 percent of the funding is directed to the recovery, reconstruction, and modernization of subnational needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To develop the renewable power sector, Ukraine will require $20 billion in new investments by 2030. Approximately half of that capacity will replace generation destroyed by Russia’s attacks, and the other half will support growth and energy diversification. Notably, these figures assume significant private sector participation. With domestic public finances strained by wartime budget deficits, Ukraine will have to rely on international financial institutions (IFIs) and private investors to supply most of the financing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some financing is underway even under wartime conditions (see Box 1). These cases illustrate how donor-backed risk mitigation tools and local financial institutions can jointly scale clean technologies. However, international partners expect Ukraine to implement clear reforms as conditions for renewed investment, such as removing local content requirements that often deter foreign companies from entering the market. Moreover, to attract sufficient financing, investors expect a stable regulatory framework, and unfortunately, Ukraine’s energy policy remains unpredictable. In the late 2010s, a very generous feed-in tariff (FiT) spurred a renewables boom, only to be followed by retroactive FiT cuts and unpaid debts to renewable producers in 2020–2021. This eroded investor confidence. An attempted transition to an auction-based incentive system was delayed for years. When pilot renewable auctions finally took place in late 2024 and 2025, they failed to attract interest. There were no bidders for solar or wind projects, and only one small hydro project secured a contract. The reasons are clear: policy instability, payment arrears, and flawed auction design. Investors have seen the “rules of the game” change repeatedly in Ukraine: FiT rates were cut by the parliament, contracts were not honored in full, and a 2020 mediation memorandum of understanding with renewable associations was not fully implemented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-1-recent-financing-transactions-for-energy-projects&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 1: Recent Financing Transactions for Energy Projects&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In early 2025, OKKO Group (a Ukrainian holding company that owns a large network of gas stations in Ukraine) secured €157 million ($176 million) in international finance through the European Union’s Ukraine Investment Framework (UIF) to develop clean energy projects, demonstrating how blended finance mechanisms under the Ukraine Facility can unlock large-scale private sector involvement.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Similarly, the Ukrainian energy company KNESS secured a €9.6 million ($10.35 million) loan from Oschadbank (also known as the State Savings Bank of Ukraine)—supported by a European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) guarantee—to build large battery systems that help stabilize the electricity grid.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Eco-Optima is constructing the Sokal Wind Farm in Lviv Oblast, with €40 million ($43.2 million) in financing from Oschadbank, including a €24.8 million ($28.3 million) green letter of credit facilitated by the EBRD.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Additionally, Energy Trade Group (a Ukrainian private company comprising a conglomerate of businesses specializing in the trading of gas and electricity) is building a 93 MW wind farm in Kirovohrad Oblast, financed with €26 million ($30.6 million) from the large state bank Ukrgasbank, the EBRD, and the International Finance Corporation (IFC), utilizing financial instruments such as an EBRD credit risk guarantee.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DTEK Renewables (a Ukrainian company managing the renewable energy assets of DTEK Group) received a €67 million ($76.5 million) loan from a consortium of Ukrainian banks—led by Oschadbank, together with PUMB (First Ukrainian International Bank, a leading bank in Ukraine owned by SCM Holdings) and Ukrgasbank (a leading Ukrainian state owned bank)—to construct five battery energy storage systems (BESS) across Ukraine by 2030. This is the largest domestic infrastructure loan for a BESS project in Ukraine. The project will deliver 180 MW of energy storage capacity in 2025, with a total 200 MW planned—enough to serve 600,000 households.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine needs to pursue a series of comprehensive market reforms and provide insurance mechanisms and guarantees that can reassure investors of the stability and predictability of the renewable energy sector. At the moment, Ukraine is overhauling its renewable energy auction program. In April 2025, the parliament introduced Draft Law No. 13219, proposing a shift from two-way contracts for difference (CfD) to one-way feed-in premiums (FiP), extended auction timelines, and more flexible participation rules. Concurrently, the government approved annual auction quotas for 2025–2029, starting with 330 MW in 2025—including 150 MW for wind—and scaling up to 400 MW by 2029. However, current auction quotas remain modest relative to national targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/v25KMpq.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: How Auction Quotas Reflect Needed Generation Capacity vs. Transmission System Operator (TSO) Estimates&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As illustrated in Table 1, government-approved auction volumes for 2025–2029 will cover only a fraction of Ukraine’s total renewable capacity needs by 2030: 5 percent for solar, 30 percent for wind, and 20 percent for biomass/biogas. This gap will require complementary mechanisms: direct private investments, donor-supported tenders, and long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) with major producers. For instance, Kazakhstan has signed a 25-year PPA with TotalEnergies for the 1 GW Mirny wind project, which includes a 600 megawatt-hour (MWh) battery energy storage system and is expected to supply electricity to 1 million people. Similarly, Uzbekistan has entered into a 25-year PPA with Voltalia for the 526 MW Artemisya hybrid project, combining solar, wind, and battery storage to meet the electricity needs of approximately 2.5 million inhabitants. These models could offer valuable insights for Ukraine’s renewable energy strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond cumbersome regulations, another challenging area affecting energy projects is currency stability and convertibility. Currently, Ukraine has currency controls due to martial law. Investors worry about being unable to repatriate profits in hard currency. Ukraine will need to gradually lift these controls and possibly hedge currency risk. The National Bank of Ukraine, with International Monetary Fund support, could set up a currency swap facility or guarantee that investors can convert a specific amount of hryvnia to dollars or euros at a predictable rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In parallel, Ukraine has introduced tax incentives to bolster renewable energy investments. As of July 27, 2024, the government enacted laws exempting certain energy-generating equipment from import duties and value-added tax (VAT), including PV panels, lithium-ion batteries, inverters, and specific components for wind turbines. However, complete wind turbine units remain subject to VAT and import duties, which may affect the competitiveness of wind energy projects. These exemptions are valid during the period of martial law but are set to expire on January 1, 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final challenge in rebuilding and maintaining the energy system is the availability of a skilled workforce. The war has displaced millions of Ukrainians, including engineers and electricians. For instance, a Ukrainian-American microgrid provider noted that many of the “best electricians left the front lines for safer places,” leading to maintenance issues with backup generators in hospitals. Rebuilding the energy sector will require mobilizing and training a new generation of workers—from construction crews to power system operators. Ukraine’s education and training institutions need to ramp up programs in renewable energy technology, engineering, and project management. Workforce readiness also means ensuring safety and security for personnel working in conflict zones—another reason why many projects focus on relatively safer western and central regions for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these hurdles, workforce capacity is growing. Ukrainian companies and municipalities have gained experience operating microgrids and modular systems during the war, and many professionals are contributing their expertise remotely. With strategic support, Ukraine can cultivate the human capital needed to operate a modern decentralized grid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-role-of-subnational-governments&quot;&gt;The Role of Subnational Governments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, Ukrainian cities had little autonomy in energy matters: The system was top-down. But the war has thrust local governments and mayors into a critical role in keeping the lights on and serving as frontline leaders during the energy crisis. Due to the war, they have had to improvise solutions to maintain heating and lighting for local businesses and residents. The wartime experience has demonstrated the huge value of government decentralization, with empowered local authorities responding and targeting resources for communities in need. Mayors have spearheaded installing local generation and backup systems. Local governments are now drafting “resilience plans” that include building renewable energy at municipal facilities, procuring portable generators, and even exploring municipal utilities. The decentralization of political power in Ukraine in recent years has allowed local councils to enter partnerships and pilot projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Achieving a more decentralized and sustainable energy future will undoubtedly require the involvement of subnational governments: regions (oblasts), districts (rayons), and municipalities (hromadas). If the concept of energy cooperatives is fully legalized, it will empower villages or city districts to develop shared energy resources. Ukraine is looking to models from the European Union (like German energy cooperatives) for guidance. The U.S. experience with co-ops and municipal utilities could also be instructive, illustrating how local entities can run parts of the energy system effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mayors often serve as vital connectors between national initiatives and local demands. These governments can identify suitable land or rooftops for solar projects, streamline permitting processes, and cofinance initiatives through city budgets. For example, the city of Vinnytsia in central Ukraine has championed the integration of renewable energy into the city’s district heating system and is actively advancing plans for a municipal waste-to-energy facility. Another example is Mykolaiv—a southern city near the front line—which installed 5.5 MW of its own generation capacity (a mix of diesel gensets, solar PV, and battery storage) to power critical facilities like water pumping stations. The city’s water utility now has solar panels to ensure potable water supply even if the main grid fails. Such projects illustrate how mayors are leveraging decentralized energy sources to provide essential services to their citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, most Ukrainian municipalities cannot fully fund large energy investments on their own and must attract outside capital. Communities are “open for business” and eager to pilot innovative energy solutions, with donor support. Demand is high at the local level for decentralized solutions—from villages to large cities, there is an appetite to generate their own power if financing can be found. Many Ukrainian cities have concrete clean energy projects with future revenue streams (e.g., selling power to the grid or cutting energy bills for city services) (see Box 2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this regard, mayors are also promoting transparency and good governance to bolster investor confidence and attract private finance. For example, the city of Mykolaiv, in partnership with the European Union’s Anti-Corruption Initiative, launched a public website to track international aid funds and updated procurement regulations to root out corruption. By improving accountability, cities aim to be “investment-ready” for donor-funded projects and public-private partnerships. As Mayor Oleksandr Syenkevych puts it, “Mykolaiv is ready to be a reliable partner” for energy reconstruction programs. However, there is a need for a national platform to connect cities, investors, and banks—essentially a matchmaking mechanism so that willing cities and private financiers can find each other. This could be as simple as a central project listing database or a more sophisticated endeavor such as an investment facilitation office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategic role of mayors goes beyond individual projects: They are important partners in managing and sustaining decentralized energy systems in the long term. A microgrid in a town will likely be operated by the local private utility or the municipality, so local capacity and ownership is critical. By involving mayors in planning and financing discussions now, donors and investors ensure there will be buy-in in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-2-examples-of-decentralized-energy-projects-in-ukrainian-cities&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 2: Examples of Decentralized Energy Projects in Ukrainian Cities&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Mykolaiv Solar Water Utilities Project: 5 MW solar PV and 1 MWh battery to power the city’s Vodokanal (water pumping and treatment facilities). Status: 1 MW already installed with local funds; in May 2025, the Nordic Environment Finance Corporation (NEFCO) approved a €7.2 million ($7.8 million) grant to scale up the project across multiple water infrastructure sites in Mykolaiv. Value: Ensures continuous access to potable water during blackouts by reducing reliance on grid electricity and diesel. The solar-battery combination strengthens climate and war-related resilience for essential services. Long-term cost savings are expected through lower electricity bills and reduced operational risks.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Vinnytsia Waste-to-Energy Plant: Proposed 10 MW facility aims to convert municipal solid waste into electricity and heat, generating an estimated 80 GWh annually. Status: A feasibility study has already been completed, and the city is currently seeking approximately $30 million in public-private partnership investment. Value: The project would significantly reduce reliance on landfills while delivering around-the-clock energy.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Khmelnytskyi region currently hosts multiple operational solar farms, adding up to roughly to 14.9 MW of capacity on city‑owned land. Value: The region is clearly scaling both solar and storage capabilities, and co-locating batteries with PV installations is part of their strategic resilience approach.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;financing-options&quot;&gt;Financing Options&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond regulatory reforms, the involvement of subnational governments, and investment in workforce capacity, Ukraine will require substantial financial resources to realize its energy vision. This financing gap could be narrowed through a combination of guarantees (such as price floors or insurance), development finance, and innovative partnerships with Western companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this regard, Europe and the United States have been strong partners to Ukraine by providing financial and technical assistance for the restoration of its energy infrastructure from Russian attacks. Europe is further stepping up with the Ukraine Facility, a $56 billion program for 2024–2027 to support recovery. Crucially, at least 20 percent of EU grant funding must go directly to subnational projects—rebuilding regional and local infrastructure, including energy systems. This reflects a recognition that empowering cities and communities is vital for effective reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the World Bank Group and the EBRD are heavily involved in Ukraine’s energy sector recovery. They are considering mechanisms like a “Premium Support Fund” to ensure renewable auction winners get paid, as well as the Electricity Price Guaranteed Fund (EPGF), which is currently under elaboration by the EBRD. The concept of the EPGF is essentially a donor-funded mechanism to guarantee minimum revenue for the power plant. If market electricity prices fall below an agreed minimum (the auction strike price), the fund pays the difference to renewable producers, ensuring revenue stability. If prices are higher, producers keep the majority of the upside, while paying special premium or commission to the fund (i.e., no “reverse payments” back to the state, unlike the current CfD scheme). This EPGF would be initially capitalized by grants from the European Union, IFIs, and others. One entity, perhaps the EBRD, would manage it, providing transparent administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of future U.S. funding to support the energy sector, the Trump administration is in the process of evaluating its foreign assistance priorities and hence aid is currently on hold. This includes winding down the U.S. Agency for International Development’s Energy Security Project and other technical assistance programs in Ukraine. While U.S. foreign aid retrenchment is part of a broader government efficiency agenda, the administration continues to emphasize “energy security” in geopolitical terms—chiefly, reducing dependence on hostile powers and promoting stable energy markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supporting Ukraine’s energy recovery not only undermines Russia’s leverage but also opens avenues for U.S. investment in Ukraine’s critical mineral resources, as evidenced by the recent U.S.-Ukraine Mineral Resources Agreement, signed in May 2025. This agreement provides the United States with preferential access to Ukraine’s valuable natural resources, tying future aid to shared profits from its vast reserves of rare earth minerals, oil, gas, and other hydrocarbons. Such strategic economic partnerships reinforce U.S. interests in the region and contribute to global energy stability. In addition, developing Ukraine’s mining resources will require complementary investments in transport infrastructure and energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, this means U.S. support for Ukraine will favor facilitating private investment and trade (e.g., exporting U.S. liquefied natural gas technology and modular reactors) over direct aid. The U.S. Development Finance Corporation (DFC), which has a mandate to mobilize private capital in challenging environments, could become a key player in Ukraine in the near future. The DFC can provide political risk insurance, project financing, and loan guarantees to U.S. investors and Ukrainian ventures, effectively filling some of the void left by the U.S. Agency for International Development’s closure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among a range of financial tools, the DFC has the ability to provide up to $1 billion in insurance and financing support per project. For instance, the DFC could back a political risk insurance facility specifically for Ukraine’s energy sector—covering risks such as war damage, expropriation, or breach of contract. It can also deploy equity stakes in funds or projects, essentially giving a U.S. government seal of approval that can crowd in other investors. It can also guarantee loans made by banks to Ukrainian energy projects, lowering interest rates. One idea is setting up a “Ukraine Clean Energy Fund,” where the DFC and European partners seed a fund that coinvests in dozens of decentralized energy projects alongside private investors. This diversifies risk and provides a one-stop vehicle for investors interested in rebuilding the energy sector under a facility with professional management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, joint U.S.-Ukrainian private sector initiatives can be part of the financing. An urban investment platform can be set up where U.S. and Ukrainian firms form consortia to bid on projects in municipal energy projects. The feasibility of joint investments is high in areas like wind, where Ukrainian developers have experience and U.S. firms have capital and technology. However, it is contingent on risk mitigation: Without guarantees on political risk and a clear signal from the U.S. government (such as a special envoy or task force to promote U.S. investment), many U.S. private investors will remain hesitant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;opportunities-for-us-ukraine-collaboration&quot;&gt;Opportunities for U.S.-Ukraine Collaboration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Ukraine rebuilds and transforms its energy system, it can incorporate lessons from the decentralized and flexible approach seen in the United States and the European Union. In the case of the United States, its energy system has evolved since the 1880s, resulting in a diverse and decentralized electricity model in many parts of the country. While the United States also has large power plants, it features robust independent power producers and distributed energy resources like rooftop solar, battery storage, and gas microturbines. Hundreds of microgrids—over 700 as of 2024—operate across the United States, especially for campuses, military bases, and critical facilities, providing resilience during outages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key elements of the U.S. model that could inform Ukraine’s future energy system include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Role of Municipal Utilities and Co-ops:&lt;/strong&gt; In the United States, many towns and cities own their electric utilities or are served by rural electric cooperatives, which gives localities influence over generation choices. U.S. municipal utilities (like in Austin, Texas; Sacramento, California; and other cities) have successfully built solar farms, battery projects, and even owned shares in wind farms to serve their cities. Knowledge sharing or twinning programs could help Ukrainian mayors and utility managers adopt best practices in governance and energy planning.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microgrid Technology:&lt;/strong&gt; U.S. companies are global leaders in microgrid controls, battery energy management, and gas engine generators. Collaboration could involve technology transfer—for example, U.S. firms supplying control systems that allow Ukrainian local grids to island, or disconnect, during an attack and then reconnect. The recent example of U.S.-Ukrainian firm New Use Energy delivering solar and battery units to Mykolaiv’s trauma hospital is a case in point. Scaling this up, U.S. providers could partner with Ukrainian firms to deploy hundreds of such microgrids at clinics, water systems, and telecommunications towers across Ukraine. This would directly support the goal of a decentralized grid as called for by the Group of Seven Clean Energy Partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Private Sector Culture:&lt;/strong&gt; U.S. energy projects typically rely on private capital with various risk mitigation instruments. Ukraine can emulate models like public-private partnerships for energy infrastructure. For example, a city could concession a solar plant project to a U.S. investor under a long-term agreement where the city agrees to purchase power (a municipal PPA). Such models are standard in the United States (e.g., cities buying solar power from private solar farms to meet renewable goals). To facilitate this in Ukraine, standardized contracts and credit enhancements will be needed (e.g., if a city’s credit is weak, a donor agency could guarantee the payments).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technology Transfer:&lt;/strong&gt; From smart grid equipment to small modular reactors (SMRs), U.S. companies have technology that Ukraine is interested in. Notably, Ukraine’s NECP mentions exploring hydrogen, energy storage, and SMRs by 2030. U.S. firms like NuScale or Westinghouse (already working with Energoatom on nuclear fuel) could pilot SMR deployment in Ukraine’s context, perhaps at a retired coal plant site. On a smaller scale, U.S. solar and battery manufacturers can find a market as Ukraine rebuilds—this aligns with U.S. industrial policy to support domestic clean technology manufacturing. Facilitating export-import of this equipment, possibly via U.S. Export-Import (EXIM) Bank financing or the DFC, would accelerate Ukraine’s energy transition.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Policy and Market Design Support:&lt;/strong&gt; U.S. regulators (such as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and state utility commissions) and grid operators (such as PJM—Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, the largest grid operator in the United States—and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc [ERCOT]) have extensive experience integrating renewables and ensuring grid reliability. Ukrainian energy regulators and the Ministry of Energy can benefit from technical advisory exchanges. For example, learning how U.S. markets handle capacity payments, ancillary services, and demand response could help Ukraine update its electricity market to reward flexibility—a key for balancing renewables. Although Ukraine is already a member of the Energy Community (an organization bringing together the European Union and nine neighboring EU candidate or potential candidate countries to create an integrated regional energy market based on a legally binding framework) and synchronizes with ENTSO-E (the European grid), insights from the United States on how to develop a competitive market (and cautionary lessons from California’s early blackouts or Texas’s 2021 freeze) could also be valuable as Ukraine reimagines its energy sector.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joint Ventures and Investment:&lt;/strong&gt; Perhaps the most impactful collaboration is through joint investment projects, with U.S. investors partnering on municipal energy projects. One example is Vinnytsia’s solar farm proposal: The city has land available and demand for a 50 MW solar farm with battery storage to stabilize its grid. A U.S. investor could team up with a Ukrainian developer under the DFC’s political risk insurance to build it, with power sold under Ukraine’s upcoming auction or a contract with the city. Similarly, waste-to-energy plants in cities like Khmelnytskyi (which has a major nuclear plant and is exploring using nuclear heat for district heating) could use U.S. waste-to-energy tech. These projects could be structured as profit-sharing enterprises where both the U.S. and Ukrainian private sectors invest.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly, U.S. stakeholders should approach Ukraine’s energy modernization not from the traditional foreign aid lens, but as strategic commercial opportunities. For U.S. energy companies, this is a timely opportunity to enter a new and expanding market, build lasting partnerships, and support democratic allies through economic engagement. Partnering with Ukrainian municipalities offers a chance to deploy innovative technologies in real-world conditions, while contributing to the resilience and recovery of critical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investing in Ukraine today lays the foundation for long-term business growth and aligns directly with U.S. interests in energy security and global competitiveness. This dual benefit—advancing national interests while opening new commercial avenues—should appeal to both Washington policymakers and the U.S. private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;looking-ahead-policy-recommendations&quot;&gt;Looking Ahead: Policy Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s energy future hinges on providing a stable regulatory environment, resolving pending issues and off-taker agreements (i.e., arrangements between producers of renewable energy and their buyers), empowering subnational governments and cities through direct funding and technical aid, and leveraging private sector joint ventures for technology transfer and investment. This final section provides specific policy recommendations to operationalize these solutions, ensuring that Ukraine’s energy transformation moves from planning to implementation, even amid uncertainty. The following are key recommendations for U.S. government agencies, Ukrainian authorities, and international partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support Ukraine’s Energy Market Reforms:&lt;/strong&gt; Ukraine needs to implement energy market reforms, and EU partners—together with the U.S. Department of Energy—can support this process by providing technical assistance, including the following actions:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assist Ukraine’s energy regulator, the National Energy and Utilities Regulatory Commission (NEURC), in developing reliable tariff methodologies that ensure cost-recovery for renewables and eliminate payment backlogs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Encourage Ukraine to implement proportional curtailment compensation and priority dispatch for renewables to boost investor trust that their assets will not be arbitrarily shut off without compensation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assist in critical reforms under Chapter 15 (Energy) and Chapter 21 (Trans-European Networks) of the EU Acquis (the EU body of laws), including steps to liberalize energy markets, strengthen independent regulation, modernize and integrate energy networks with Europe, and accelerate the energy transition. Ukraine still needs to implement several energy reforms to align fully with EU standards, related to the following issues:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The electricity and gas markets remain only partially liberalized. Wartime interventions, price caps, and a remonopolization of the gas sector under martial law continue to distort competition and hinder a truly open market.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;NEURC’s autonomy remains limited. Although legal reforms have been enacted, the commission still operates under executive control, and with at least one plotted vacancy and a lack of transparent replacement procedures, it has yet to achieve the independent, EU-compliant regulatory structure required for Chapter 15 alignment.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In the renewables sector, Ukraine has introduced market-based support schemes (auctions and feed-in premiums), but these are not yet fully operational. Their proper implementation is crucial to attract investment and settle outstanding debts to renewable energy producers.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In parallel, Ukraine must modernize its electricity grid and expand cross-border interconnections, as wartime damage and inadequate network tariffs have impeded the investments needed for a reliable energy infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Finally, building up strategic energy reserves remains a priority. While Ukraine adopted an oil stockpiling law in line with EU requirements, implementation is incomplete and minimum reserves are not yet maintained. Similarly, Ukraine must finalize its gas security of supply framework, including legal transposition, emergency planning, and strategic storage targets, to fully comply with EU rules.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expand Engagement in Municipal Energy Projects:&lt;/strong&gt; Given the importance of subnational governments in Ukraine’s energy modernization, donors could engage more directly with city-level projects. For example, they could:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Encourage the EU Ukraine Facility and World Bank to allocate grants or subsidized-interest loans for municipal energy programs, through existing frameworks like the Ukraine Municipal Infrastructure Program.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Embed technical advisors, such as retired utility executives or engineers, with key cities to help mayors plan and execute energy projects.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fund a Project Preparation Facility specifically for energy that helps Ukrainian communities conduct pre-feasibility studies, permitting, and tendering for clean energy projects—creating a pipeline of “bankable” projects ready for auction or direct investment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Complete a small auction or reverse auction for municipal projects to build confidence for larger ones. For example, solicit bids for 100 MW of biomass and solar and battery storage projects across several city sites, with cofunding from an international donor. Ensure that the contracts are awarded quickly to start construction without major delays.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facilitate Partnerships with Businesses:&lt;/strong&gt; Business associations operating in Ukraine—such as the American Chamber of Commerce Ukraine, the European Business Association, and the U.S.-Ukraine Business Council—could act as conveners and facilitate alliances between U.S., European, and Ukrainian businesses and subnational governments. The activities they could pursue include:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Organizing trade missions and virtual pitch sessions where Ukrainian municipalities can present projects to U.S. and European companies and investors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Launching a “U.S.-Ukraine Energy Partnership Exchange” by bringing Ukrainian mayors and energy officials to visit U.S. microgrid sites, while sending U.S. city energy managers to Ukraine, if security permits. These exchanges would build relationships that support technology transfer and twinning arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set Up an Electricity Price Guarantee Fund:&lt;/strong&gt; Work with allies to create an Electricity Minimum Price Guarantee Fund for Ukraine’s renewable projects. Such a fund could address off-taker risk and unlock several billion dollars in private investment. The European Union or United States could contribute seed funding (e.g., via a DFC-administered fund) to help reach an initial $300 to $500 million target. Managed by a multilateral entity, this fund would guarantee a floor price for power from renewables, ensuring revenues.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expand U.S. Financing Options:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States should authorize and encourage institutions such as the DFC and the EXIM Bank to deploy their full suite of tools in Ukraine. Specifically, it should:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Expand DFC’s insurance products covering energy projects. The DFC could also invest in private equity funds that cofinance dozens of renewable and battery installations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Include Ukrainian clean energy projects in the remit of the EXIM Bank for export credit support. For example, the EXIM Bank could finance U.S. equipment sales for a solar farm in Ukraine with sovereign or city guarantee.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Extend the U.S.-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund to cover energy infrastructure including grid upgrades, renewables, and storage, which involves minerals such as lithium, cobalt, copper, and rare earths used in batteries, turbines, and power networks. This would accelerate Ukraine’s EU‑compliant energy transition and support the resilience of U.S. critical raw materials supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Address Workforce Gaps Through Training:&lt;/strong&gt; Workforce development should be built into every investment by promoting on-site training for Ukrainian technicians and prioritizing the use of local labor. Donors and investors could make skilled worker training a condition of funding—for example, pairing a solar plant project with the training of local electricians. Training not only helps ensure projects are properly staffed and run smoothly, but also strengthens Ukraine’s pool of skilled workers. The United States could support this effort by helping expand Ukrainian vocational programs in fields like solar installation and electrical engineering, potentially through online courses offered by U.S. community colleges or companies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set Up a Monitoring System:&lt;/strong&gt; Finally, donors and partners, in collaboration with Ukraine, could establish a strong monitoring system to track progress on reforms and the implementation of energy projects. This system would help identify setbacks early and enable timely adjustments. For instance, if a strategy is not working, such as auctions failing due to war-related risks, stakeholders should be ready to pivot, possibly by adopting negotiated PPAs or increasing donor guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has a unique opportunity to transform its energy system into a decentralized, secure, and sustainable model. Such a transition would not only strengthen the resilience of its infrastructure against future Russian threats but also accelerate its integration into the Western energy market, advancing both Ukraine’s energy independence and U.S. strategic and economic interests in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the face of evolving geopolitical pressures and rising energy demands, this report from the Energy Security and Climate Change Program explores why integrating the electric grids of Europe and the Mediterranean is essential to European energy security and climate change goals. It examines the drivers of interconnection, such as decarbonization, economic resilience, and digital transformation, and the technical, regulatory, and political challenges to such integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on insights from a high-level convening in Athens, Greece, cohosted by CSIS and the German Marshall Fund of the United States, the report examines the Mediterranean region’s role in linking European energy markets to renewable-rich regions in North Africa. Several planned cross-border projects are positioned to not only supply clean energy to Europe, but also to strengthen political cooperation, attract foreign investment, and spur economic development in partner regions. As this report details, grid integration has emerged as a cornerstone of Europe’s long-term energy strategy, helping to respond to climate change, address energy prices, and mitigate strategic vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;geopolitics-connectivity-and-energy-security-an-athens-conversation&quot;&gt;Geopolitics, Connectivity, and Energy Security: An Athens Conversation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On March 31, 2025, the German Marshall Fund of the United States, in collaboration with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, hosted a conference in Athens, Greece. Sponsored by the Public Power Corporation S.A. (PPC), this meeting was the third in a series of convenings that had begun a year prior in Washington, D.C. But this one came at a precipitous time, as President Donald Trump and his administration were rapidly realigning the foreign policy of the United States and its stance toward Europe. The urgency and uncertainty of the moment forced participants beyond convention and toward a survey of the new ground on which the politics of energy will play out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Leverag[ing] technological progress and steep cost curves to produce homegrown renewable electricity … coupled with expansion and modernization of our power grids contributes to the affordability and energy security of the region.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;OLD ALLIES, NEW RULES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration’s approach to transatlantic issues has awed European leaders. In February, Vice President JD Vance gave a speech at the Munich Security Conference that offered a stinging critique of European political leaders and their approach to domestic and international politics. The Trump administration seemed dedicated to withdrawing security support for Europe to force the bloc to stand up for its own defense. The administration’s haste to reform the transatlantic relationship, alongside its aim to force peace between Russia and Ukraine, felt to many in Europe like abandonment. Trade conflicts added an economic dimension to the perceived antagonism. Liberation Day, which came just two days after this conference, threatened a 20 percent tariff on European goods entering the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Panelists in Athens agreed on the urgent need for Europe to establish a strategy for engagement with the United States and chart its own path forward in global affairs. With a rapidly receding United States, they pointed out, European leaders will need to find ways to manage internal strife and political dynamics to focus on essential goals: funding defense, ensuring economic competitiveness, and dealing with the new economic nationalism of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, panelists on either side of this reorientation were optimistic about the prospects for Europe and the transatlantic relationship that will emerge under these new conditions. Panelists observed that pressure from the United States could incentivize Europe into deeper internal collaboration around key areas: security, economic competitiveness, and energy. They also noted that the more independent Europe which emerges could be a larger economic and geopolitical force than the Europe of today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I think two enduring feature of Trumpism that are not just going to be a feature of this administration, but likely continue going forward is greater transactionalism and more nationalism.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I actually think Europe’s going to emerge from this stronger definitely on the security front. And I actually think the pressure from Trump is going to drive a lot of economic reforms in Europe that’s going to make Europe more competitive. So, I’m actually bullish on Europe. I would buy Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Transatlantic relations is going to go through an incredibly rough patch over the next year and I think it’s going to get so bad that we’re not sure that we can repair it. And that involves everything from Greenland to trade, tech fights over Twitter, and troop withdrawals. But I think that Europe comes out of this in some ways stronger and it may be actually beneficial to Europe in the long run.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I land where my colleagues land, which is I think that the transatlantic relationship will emerge from this period intact. So be patient. Don’t write us off. We will stick around.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-charles-kupchan-senior-fellow-council-on-foreign-relations&quot;&gt;– Charles Kupchan, Senior Fellow, Council on Foreign Relations&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The burden sharing point is an old one. Multiple administrations have brought this to Europe with more or less success. His style is perhaps a little different, but nonetheless the message is not that much different, pay more do more, et cetera.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While U.S.-European relations are tumultuous today, panelists thought it would be a mistake to discount the lasting transatlantic alignment, even as the rules and expectations that may govern it will change. The relationship between the United States and Europe is defined by a shared history and deep economic, social, and cultural integration. Shared U.S.-European interests reveal that working together will yield benefits for both. And the core of the new cooperation could be energy security and innovation, where the two blocs have been aligned and able to cooperate across multiple administrations and presidencies. In the near term, such cooperation will likely require a more pragmatic, project-based, approach—where investments in infrastructure and technology innovation can realize benefits for both the United States and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE ESSENTIAL ROLE OF SOUTHEAST EUROPE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A central theme in the conversations was how countries in Europe could transform the now three-year energy crisis into an opportunity to establish a comprehensive, long-term, energy framework for the continent. The challenges to doing so are significant. Europeans still pay high prices for energy, and the threat of energy insecurity looms. The costs of investment in energy now must be weighed against the need to invest in economic security and reestablish a defense industrial base. And Europe maintains a legal and political mandate to respond to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Panelists highlighted three key tools for addressing those challenges: policy alignment, innovation, and interconnection. On policy, panelists pointed to the need to align energy strategies at the European level, so that the 27 EU member countries could act together. With more cross-border mechanisms for exchanging energy, Europe can plan to use its resource endowments more efficiently, reducing costs and leveraging technology and markets to develop energy in line with climate goals. With sufficient interconnection, Europe could capture wind or solar when each is most available and reduce the high prices that have plagued smaller markets like those in eastern and southeastern Europe. In adding innovative energy storage technologies and complementary gas infrastructure, Europe can realize a more secure energy sector and economic competitiveness. To execute this will take the same level of coordination and commitment of purpose that Europe displayed after the 2021 energy crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A European approach to energy will have to extend beyond European borders. The conference’s location in Athens gave panelists the opportunity to explore the ever-changing geopolitical landscape in southeastern Europe and the role the region will play in broader energy and geopolitical events in the coming years. Greece already acts as a connecting point between the Mediterranean and the countries of eastern Europe, providing trade in oil and refined products, access to gas via the ports on the Mediterranean, and exports of plentiful electricity. As renewable capacity in the region increases, Greece also has the capacity to play a key role in the supply of clean electricity into Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;“The challenge that we face is on the one hand we have a climate pressure, but we also have the pressure of energy costs and competitiveness. And so a big part of our job as policy makers is how do you juggle those different things? Because the more you do in one way, the more difficult it might be to do something else.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;“The trouble for a country like Greece in thinking about the connectivity with especially essentially North Africa is the scale of North Africa is so much greater than what we can absorb. So if you bring electricity from Egypt and you just bring it to Greece, there’s just too much. So really for us, it’s about refashioning the European network.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several interconnections that will link southern Europe to North Africa and the Middle East are already being planned and promoted. These proposed interconnections will serve not just one market, but all of Europe via connections through countries like Greece. In shifting the conversation from supplying Greece to supplying much of Europe, regional and international connections will emphasize the significant political and geopolitical advances that come from deeper power integration. Large interconnections require trust, stability, and security at either end. And they can bring economic opportunity and investment to developing or conflict-damaged societies. By fostering energy partnerships across traditional boundaries, Europe has an opportunity to build more than infrastructure. It can build lasting frameworks for regional cooperation, economic development, and security. Southeastern Europe, and Greece, will be at the heart of this revolution. As Alexandros Paterakis of PPC has observed,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Greece is where it is. It’s at the southeastern tip of Europe and it’s in the middle of the crossroads … whether it’s North Africa or Middle East, I think at this point in time there’s no going back. Integration or connectivity as we mentioned before will have to happen at this level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;INNOVATION AND INTEGRATION: THE PATH FORWARD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Globally, it has become increasingly evident that the economic frontier is heavily reliant on the expansion of the electricity system. The expansion of data centers to power artificial intelligence (AI) is the most immediate concern, as companies and countries are chasing opportunity in a brand new industry. Speaking of one recent PPC initiative in West Macedonia, Georgios Stassis remarked,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We announced just last week the development of a mega data center in the area of West Macedonia, an area where our former mines were located. Initially, our mega data center will have the capacity of 300 megawatts and gradually we’ll move to the level of 1,000 megawatts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following on, however, is energy demand growth that will come from multiple sources. Improving productivity from AI portends potentially rapid economic growth and energy demand growth to match. Meanwhile, rerouting and reshoring manufacturing supply chains for defense, energy, and other products will accompany electrifying large parts of the economy in putting upward pressure on demand. The very same areas where Europe must invest to meet its economic, geopolitical, and energy priorities will put new demands on electricity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Panelists in Athens emphasized the growing interconnectedness of the digital and energy economies, presenting both challenges and opportunities for Europe. One such opportunity lies in the convergence of these two sectors, which offers numerous avenues for generating efficiencies and new revenue streams, as well as balancing electricity grids with innovative economic activities. Data centers, anticipated to be substantial energy consumers, can contribute to both economic growth and geoeconomic cooperation with the United States, a global leader in this technology. As the infrastructure necessary for developing these data centers and providing them with power and digital infrastructure is constructed, new investment can go to redeveloping industrial areas to the benefit of local communities, countries, and the global community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-history-of-europes-grid-integration&quot;&gt;The History of Europe’s Grid Integration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European electricity grid is the largest interconnected transmission network in the world. It is overseen by the European Network of Transmission Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E), which comprises 40 member transmission system operators (TSOs) representing 36 countries (Figure 1). This integration originated across eight western European countries and was initially called the Union for the Coordination of Production and Transmission of Electricity (UCPTE). It arose out of the Marshall Plan, and its purpose was to ensure the most effective use of the limited energy resources remaining after the severe destruction of European infrastructure during World War II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the UCPTE expanded to include additional western European countries throughout the 1980s, both political and technical constraints limited further west–east synchronous interconnection until 1995, when UCPTE integrated with the CENTREL group of power utilities comprising the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and, Slovakia. Further expansion to North Africa was realized in 1998 when a submarine cable was completed between Morocco and Spain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current iteration of ENTSO-E was established in 2008 as part of a cooperative commitment acknowledging the intensive coordination needed between transmission operators, generators, legislators, regulators, researchers, and other stakeholders to meet the European Union’s newly announced “20-20-20” targets (20 percent decarbonization, 20 percent increase in share of renewable energy sources, and 20 percent improvement in energy efficiency by 2020).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, ENTSO-E spans over 550,000 kilometers of circuits comprising alternating current (AC) lines and cables and direct current (DC) cables. Cross-border exchanges within ENTSO-E member countries totaled almost 420 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2023, while exchanges between ENTSO-E member countries and external countries totaled 18 TWh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2012, 14 TSOs from 12 countries established the Association of the Mediterranean Transmission System Operators for electricity (Med-TSO) to use multilateral collaboration to facilitate the integration of the Mediterranean power systems and to foster security and socioeconomic development in the region. Today, it has expanded to include 20 TSOs from 20 Mediterranean countries (Figure 2), some of which are also ENTSO-E member countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Commission has supported several of the recently completed and proposed future projects in the Med-TSO, in recognition of their benefits for energy security, renewable energy integration, and political and economic stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;renewable-resources&quot;&gt;Renewable Resources&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mediterranean region has untapped potential for deploying renewable energy sources. Harnessing these resources is essential both to decarbonize the Mediterranean region—where fossil fuels make up 65 percent of the energy mix in northern states and 92 percent in the south—and to generate clean electricity and hydrogen to export to the European Union to help meet Europe’s climate goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union’s “Fit for 55” laws obligate the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 percent by 2030 and require the European Union to be climate neutral by 2050. Among other provisions, Fit for 55 includes a revised renewable energy directive that increases the EU-level target of renewable energy sources in the overall energy mix from at least 32 percent to at least 40 percent by 2030. Additionally, Fit for 55 includes a hydrogen and decarbonized gas market package that aims to shift to 66 percent of natural gas demand being met by renewable and low-carbon gases, up from 5 percent today. To meet both of these targets, the European Union will have to rely on imported electricity and fuels from the Mediterranean region, where there is high renewable potential (Figure 4 and Figure 5) and a relatively high degree of available land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many countries in the southern Mediterranean region have ambition to expand renewable capacity, in part to mitigate climate impacts in the vulnerable region and in part to take advantage of opportunities to meet Europe’s clean energy demand. For example, Tunisia and Morocco have signed the Global Renewables and Energy Efficiency Pledge. The region has also supported the Pan-Arab Sustainable Energy Strategy 2030, which aims to reach 12.4 percent renewable energy share in the Arab region’s electricity mix. Furthermore, several of the countries in this region have submitted nationally determined contributions (NDCs) with renewable energy targets as part of the Paris Agreement (Table 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economics&quot;&gt;Economics&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to helping to meet climate goals, grid integration between Europe and the Mediterranean will help reduce reliance on volatile natural gas markets and allow for more cost-effective integration of renewable resources with higher capacity factors in North Africa than in many parts of Europe. Additionally, interconnected grids facilitate price convergence across the connected regions, which will be economically favorable to countries with isolated grids and high costs of electricity, such as Cyprus. Grid integration also disadvantages countries with low electricity costs by causing local electricity prices to increase, although generally larger integrated markets are likely to drive innovation and efficiency gains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the Mediterranean region, integrating with Europe will allow for new export opportunities for green electricity and hydrogen, which will diversify and expand the economy while reducing dependence on traditional fossil fuel exports. Additionally, interconnection projects and associated infrastructure and supply chain development create jobs in manufacturing, installation, maintenance, and related services. Import demand from Europe also de-risks renewable energy projects, which can further attract foreign investment into the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;security-reliability-and-resilience&quot;&gt;Security, Reliability, and Resilience&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest advantages of cross-border interconnections is the enhanced reliability of electricity supply; power outages are reduced, as failures of a generating unit can be immediately compensated for by neighboring systems. Integrated grids allow for easier ability to control frequency stability and voltage levels, as the total system can be controlled without each separate system having to maintain its own frequency. In an integrated setup, the total reserve capacity only needs to match the highest single-system loss, instead of each grid holding enough reserves to cover its own worst-case scenario. This is because power imbalances in one area can be offset by adjustments in generation or load elsewhere within the interconnected network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, longer-term reliability and resilience against both natural disasters and geopolitical tensions are strengthened by grid integration. A greater diversity of primary energy sources and more spatially dispersed generators contribute to greater supply security. For example, if one area is impacted by an extreme event that causes power disruptions, a geographically expansive network allows for the loss of generation to be supplemented by plants in other regions not impacted by the event. This will become especially important as the Mediterranean region increasingly experiences extreme heat and precipitation events exacerbated by climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recent-and-planned-integrations&quot;&gt;Recent and Planned Integrations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interconnecting energy systems is of great strategic importance. Europe is a leader in this field, with close to 12 percent of member states’ electricity consumption coming from a neighboring country. The EU target is to reach a cross-border capacity ratio of least 15 percent by 2030. Most recently, in 2022 Ukraine and Moldova’s grids were connected and synchronized; while this connection had already been planned for 2024, the project was expedited in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In February 2025, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania successfully disconnected from the Russian-controlled BRELL energy system and synchronized their electricity grids with Europe to strengthen their geopolitical position and boost long-term energy security and competitiveness. The synchronization initiative received over 1.2 billion euros in grants from the European Union’s Connecting Europe Facility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further European grid expansion will primarily come in the form of new long-distance high-voltage transmission lines, primarily subsea cables. To meet the stated interconnection target while simultaneously meeting EU climate targets, many of these interconnections must link the European grid to Mediterranean countries with abundant renewable energy potential. The only current interconnection between Europe and North Africa is between Spain and Morocco, consisting of two cables with an expansion expected by 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Med-TSO published a masterplan in 2022 that proposes 19 interconnection projects across five envisioned corridors (Figure 6):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Western Mediterranean Corridor (Algeria, Morocco, Portugal, Spain)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Central Mediterranean Corridor and North Africa Backbone (Algeria, Egypt, Italy, Libya, Tunisia)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;East Mediterranean Interconnectors (Cyprus, Egypt, Greece, Israel, Turkey)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eastern Balkan Corridor (Bulgaria, Italy, Greece, Turkey)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Middle East Mediterranean Integration (Egypt, Jordan, Palestine, Syria, Turkey)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The portfolio of interconnections is estimated to span about 10,000 kilometers of new transmission lines, allowing for almost 20 GW of new transfer capacity among Mediterranean countries. The flexibility from these interconnections is estimated to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 24 metric tons (MT) per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/TzMXUrB.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;integration-projects-planned-by-2030&quot;&gt;Integration Projects Planned by 2030&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the expansion of the Spain–Morocco interconnection, the planned projects anticipated to be completed by 2030 include the GREGY interconnection (linking Europe to Egypt), the Great Sea Interconnector (linking Europe to Israel), and the ELMED project (connecting Italy and Tunisia).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GREGY: CLEAN ENERGY FROM EGYPT TO GREECE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GREGY is a proposed project to link Egypt to Europe via Greece by a 3,000-megawatt (MW) submarine cable spanning almost 1,000 kilometers. Once completed, the cable would carry renewable energy generated in Egypt and is estimated to displace 4.5 billion cubic meters (bcm) per year of natural gas consumption, thereby reducing carbon dioxide emissions by about 10 million MT annually. Approximately one third of the renewable electricity from Egypt would be used by Greece directly, while another third is anticipated to be used by Greece as input to produce low-carbon fuels; the final third will likely be transferred to other European countries. At an estimated cost of 4.2 billion euros, developers seek a final investment decision by the end of 2025 and to be fully operational by 2030. While not yet fully financed or green-lit, the project has already been included in the European Union’s Global Gateway initiative focused on mobilizing investments to promote sustainable infrastructure development in partner countries. GREGY is also under consideration as a European Commission project of mutual interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE GREAT SEA INTERCONNECTOR: CONNECTING GREECE, CYPRUS, AND ISRAEL&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Construction on the Great Sea Interconnector subsea cable between Greece, Cyprus, and Israel (formerly called the EuroAsia Interconnector) began in December 2023 and is expected to be completed by the end of 2030 at an estimated cost of 2 billion euros. A grant of almost 660 million euros has been promised by the European Union toward the section connecting Cyprus with Crete. The two-way high-voltage direct current (HVDC) line will span over 1,200 kilometers at a depth of over 3,000 meters to deliver 2 GW of energy to Europe, supplying electricity to over 3 million homes. The idea of connecting the power grids between Greece, Cyprus, and Israel has been discussed for over a decade, primarily to mitigate energy security risks for Cyprus and Israel, which currently each operate under isolated grids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ELMED: CONNECTING ITALY AND TUNISIA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ELMED project would span almost 225 kilometers, 200 of which would be offshore at a depth of 800 meters. The interconnection is anticipated to reduce generation costs and renewable curtailment in Italy in the near term and allow Tunisia to export renewable energy to Europe in the long term. Studies have also shown that the interconnection would contribute to increased energy security and improved resilience of the Tunisian power system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;financing-europeanmediterranean-interconnection-projects&quot;&gt;Financing European–Mediterranean Interconnection Projects&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While specific project costs vary depending on the length of the interconnection and the depth of the subsea cables, cost estimates for electricity grid projects connecting Europe to the Mediterranean are on the order of billions of euros. Commercial loans and equity investments are important funding mechanisms for electricity grid interconnection projects, but such large projects may also require government support. A range of financing mechanisms have been leveraged to raise capital from public sources, demonstrating the potential benefits of developing such infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EU FUNDING&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Connecting Europe Facility for Energy is the main source of EU funding for energy interconnection projects. The European Union has allocated over 5.8 billion euros to the energy sector between 2021 and 2027 for projects that help the transition toward clean energy, with a focus on cross-border renewable energy projects, interoperability of networks, and better integration of the internal energy market.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The European Union introduced a temporary instrument in 2021 called the Recovery and Resilience Facility, which designates over 180 billion euros for clean energy projects that help EU countries make critical reforms and investments needed to rapidly end their dependence on Russian fossil fuels. It also channels funding for the implementation of the REPowerEU plan to accelerate the clean energy transition and boost EU competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The European Investment Bank (EIB) plays a role in cross-border infrastructure projects. The EIB provided loans totaling 3.5 billion euros for cross-border electricity infrastructure from 2010 to 2022, covering 40 percent of these projects’ total investment costs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) provides financing for transmission projects that support energy market interconnection and promote further regional integration.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The African Development Bank (AfDB) invests in infrastructure projects to support economic development and regional integration, which includes financing electricity interconnection projects between North Africa and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) has historically been an important source of financing for some large-scale interconnection projects in Europe, and especially Ukraine. It also invests in strategically important projects. In 2024, the DFC submitted a letter of intent to support the Great Sea Interconnector project.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The World Bank has supported energy infrastructure projects intended to expand regional integration. In 2023, the World Bank approved almost 270 million dollars in financing for the ELMED interconnector and support for Tunisia’s renewable energy trade.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;challenges&quot;&gt;Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;legal-regulatory-and-market-barriers&quot;&gt;Legal, Regulatory, and Market Barriers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most significant barriers to cross-border grid integration between Europe and the southern and eastern Mediterranean is navigating the different regulatory environments. Common market rules are needed to ensure fair competition, transparent and non-discriminatory network tariffs, proper cross-border trade mechanisms, congestion management, and capacity allocation mechanisms. The more market designs and rules between countries or regions differ, the more likely it is that trade is impeded or distorted between markets. Harmonizing or otherwise adjudicating electricity market regulations, standards, and energy policies is therefore a prerequisite for cross-border interconnection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union has largely already unified under a common regulatory structure facilitated by the Agency for Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER), which works toward developing common market rules and coordinating actions of national regulators. The EU electricity market is liberalized and predominately operates on a marginal pricing model. In contrast, the southern and eastern Mediterranean countries generally operate under less competitive markets and more vertically integrated utilities. In recognition of the importance of integration, the Association of Mediterranean Energy Regulators (MEDREG) is promoting harmonization of electricity markets and regulations across the region by bringing together regulators across 22 countries, but full harmonization will require drastic changes in the regulatory framework, market procedures, technical rules, and administrative measures. In the meantime, differences in markets and rules continue to present challenges to cross-regional grid integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;technical-constraints&quot;&gt;Technical Constraints&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While several examples of successful electricity interconnections via subsea cables exist, it continues to be a technically complex undertaking. The subsea cable routes must be carefully surveyed to ensure the long-term security and stability of the cable and avoid any obstacles during construction. Additionally, laying the cables requires specialized vessels to install the cables at great depths and under high pressure. The cables themselves must be carefully engineered with advanced materials to withstand the harsh conditions and mitigate energy losses, mechanical stress, and risk of failure. Beyond the cables themselves, converting between the HVDC lines and AC grids requires complex power electronics and control systems. If the HVDC line is connecting to asynchronous grids, it must actively manage the power flow. Careful protection schemes and coordination mechanisms are also needed to account for the differences in characteristics between AC and DC lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;realizing-strategic-alignment&quot;&gt;Realizing Strategic Alignment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“One of the things that Europe needs to do with its energy policy within the context of transatlantic relations is identify initiatives that have bipartisan American support.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-gabriel-mitchell-policy-fellow-at-the-mitvim-institute&quot;&gt;– Gabriel Mitchell, Policy Fellow at the Mitvim Institute&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mediterranean energy interconnections solve multiple European challenges at once: They enhance security, build resilience, and make energy more affordable in markets hungry for clean power. These connections form the backbone of Europe’s energy security strategy in an increasingly competitive global landscape. For Mediterranean nations on both shores, these projects transform geographic location into strategic advantage, placing them at the center of emerging energy geopolitics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe’s energy crisis taught its leaders a painful lesson: Depending on a single supplier creates dangerous vulnerability. Now, as Europe builds a more determined energy strategy—one that delivers clean power at affordable prices—expanded interconnections offer a twofold benefit. They improve energy resilience while weakening Russia’s ability to weaponize its resources against European interests. This approach aligns perfectly with the United States’ long-standing goal of European energy independence, a policy that serves both economic and strategic purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As leaders in Europe and the United States rethink transatlantic relations, European leaders must identify energy projects that can win U.S. support and engage regional powers. For the United States, supporting Europe’s energy independence through these interconnections makes perfect sense. Such infrastructure investments advance multiple American strategic interests: They can help countries recover from conflict, add to energy abundance and security in Europe, and promote economic development in the Middle East and North Africa. These aren’t merely power lines and pipelines—they’re pathways to stability, prosperity, and peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As generative AI technologies rapidly evolve, their implications for global information security are becoming more acute. This paper explores how Russian state-affiliated and state-aligned actors are discussing, conceptualising and framing AI within their online communications. Drawing on original analysis of communications from Russian-linked online channels, the paper investigates how actors in the Russian influence ecosystem perceive the role of AI in information warfare and what their narratives reveal about evolving threat trajectories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report finds that a diverse range of Russian actors are actively engaged in conversations about AI. These actors are not only discussing the use of AI tools to automate and amplify content, but also exploring the role of AI as a narrative device, boasting of its effectiveness, warning of its dangers and framing it as both a strategic asset and a potential threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis reveals a growing focus on AI as both an opportunity and a threat among various Russian actors, from those affiliated with groups like Wagner, to pro-Russian hacktivist collectives and online influencers. AI is often portrayed as a powerful tool for information manipulation, capable of generating persuasive content, amplifying messaging and overwhelming adversaries with sheer volume. At the same time, many actors express significant anxiety about Western dominance over AI development, suggesting that these technologies could be used to subvert Russian public opinion, erode autonomy and destabilise the domestic information environment. Concerns about surveillance, deepfakes (digitally altered videos or images aiming to misrepresent a person as doing or saying something they did not say or do in the original version of the image or video) and algorithmic bias feature prominently in this discourse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The observed conversations are not confined to abstract speculation. The paper documents how state-affiliated and state-aligned actors are actively debating the implications of AI, sharing practical knowledge, critiquing disinformation practices and recruiting individuals with relevant technical skills. These insights point to an evolving culture of adaptation within Russian influence networks, where AI is increasingly seen as a central component of future-facing information operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the paper does not assess the inner workings of senior intelligence planning, it offers a unique actor-level perspective on how AI is entering the strategic imagination of Russian influence networks. These insights highlight the importance of not only tracking how AI might be operationalised in future disinformation efforts, but also understanding the ways in which it is already shaping how these actors think, communicate and position themselves within digital ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proliferation of generative AI has raised widespread concern over the potential exploitation of AI by malicious actors to disrupt information ecosystems. While early warnings about AI-generated disinformation primarily focused on its theoretical risks, recent evidence suggests that a range of actors are already incorporating these technologies into their influence operations. Understanding how such actors perceive, experiment with and deploy generative AI is essential to anticipating future threats and designing effective countermeasures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This issue is particularly pressing in the context of Russian information operations. The Russian government has long prioritised information warfare as a central element of statecraft, viewing the information domain as a theatre of conflict on par with conventional or nuclear warfare. Disinformation actors affiliated with the Russian state are thought to have invested heavily in AI technologies to influence European audiences in the run-up to the 2024 European Parliament elections. As generative AI becomes more accessible and more powerful, it lowers the barrier to entry for a wider ecosystem of pro-Russian actors, including state-linked media, hacktivists and online influencers, to experiment with and operationalise these tools in increasingly sophisticated ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the severity of this threat, understanding of disinformation and influence operations carried out by Russian state-affiliated actors remains limited. Current discussions focus on outputs, with less attention to how Russian-affiliated actors perceive or discuss the role of AI in influence campaigns. This paper seeks to address this gap by examining how Russian state-affiliated and state-aligned actors and groups – including state-linked social media groups and channels, hacktivist collectives, military-affiliated groups and online influencers – are discussing AI. The paper considers how AI might be a beneficial tool in their arsenal or supplement their existing techniques, tactics and activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper generates new insight into Russian disinformation and influence activities by scoping and analysing the online communications channels and information ecosystems of these actors and groups. In doing so, it analyses how actors within these spaces discuss AI, including their perceptions, understandings and knowledge of how this technology is currently used, and could be used for propaganda purposes. The paper presents a unique perspective on the current and future practices of Russian state-affiliated and state-aligned groups and their attempts to influence and polarise audiences and public opinions, with a particular focus on Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This analysis is situated within a growing body of literature that explores AI-enabled influence operations, while offering a more actor-centric perspective. Rather than treating Russian disinformation as a monolithic, state-directed enterprise, the paper highlights the heterogeneity of actors involved and the diverse, and sometimes contradictory, ways in which they engage with AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the paper focuses on tactical and mid-level actors, it does not attempt to map the strategic or doctrinal thinking of the intelligence managers or decision-makers responsible for designing operations at the highest levels. Such insights are beyond the scope of open-source social media monitoring. Instead, the report contributes to a more granular understanding of how AI is being perceived, discussed and operationalised by those within the broader Russian influence ecosystem, and how these evolving practices reflect emerging threats at the operational and narrative level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;METHODOLOGY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper employs a qualitative research design to explore how Russian state-affiliated and state-aligned actors and groups discuss and deploy generative AI in the context of influence operations. The analysis draws primarily on data collected through ExTrac AI’s state-of-the-art AI-powered platform. ExTrac AI enables the automatic collection, refinement and analysis of data and multimedia materials from tens of thousands of hard-to-reach but publicly available sources daily, including communications ecosystems associated with disinformation actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research was carried out in three phases, starting with a scoping phase to identify key actors, channels and keywords related to AI and disinformation. Using ExTrac AI’s search capabilities, relevant channels were selected based on existing research on Russian influence operations, prior tagging on the platform, and results from initial keyword searches. Keywords included terms in both Russian and English. This stage provided an initial mapping of the online ecosystem of actors engaging with AI and set the foundation for subsequent analytical stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second stage, content analysis was conducted across a broader dataset, including searches over different time periods and across multiple groups. The terms and themes identified in the scoping phase were used to assess the prevalence and scope of AI-related discourse. Posts were examined to evaluate the degree of interest in AI, the level of technical or operational knowledge demonstrated and the types of narratives emerging around the use of AI for disinformation purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on insights from the initial analysis, specific case studies were then selected for further in-depth examination. These case studies focused on particular actors (such as Wagner-affiliated channels and hacktivist groups like NoName057(16)) and explored how AI was discussed and applied within their disinformation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together, these three stages provided a structured and iterative approach to understanding the perceptions, use cases and strategic considerations of AI within Russian-aligned disinformation networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russian-strategic-thinking-on-information-warfare-and-ai&quot;&gt;RUSSIAN STRATEGIC THINKING ON INFORMATION WARFARE AND AI&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To assess current and emerging disinformation threats, it is essential to understand how Russian state and military doctrine conceptualises information warfare, and how AI fits within this strategic framework. This section outlines: the foundations of Russian thinking on information confrontation and AI; actors active in this space; and operational practices integrating AI into disinformation operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strategic-foundations-of-russian-information-warfare&quot;&gt;STRATEGIC FOUNDATIONS OF RUSSIAN INFORMATION WARFARE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Russia, information warfare, or “information confrontation” as it is known in Russian doctrine, holds strategic importance which is equivalent to conventional and nuclear warfare, even in peacetime. The information domain is treated as integral to national security and geopolitical influence. While Russia rarely acknowledges cyber operations against Western targets, it also avoids directly denying them, using plausible deniability as a strategic asset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian information strategy prioritises intelligence collection, often through espionage or cyber intrusion, alongside information-psychological influence targeting individuals and mass audiences. This dual focus enables the systematic collection of data while also strengthening efforts to shape political discourse and decision-making domestically and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian disinformation campaigns aim to undermine adversaries by exacerbating internal divisions, eroding trust in democratic institutions, and weakening alliances such as NATO or the EU. This complicates unified responses to Russian actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although many of these campaigns are under-resourced and disorganised, social media platforms allow for low-cost, large-scale experimentation without significant consequence for failed attempts. Trial and error approaches carry little risk, and the volume of content often matters more than precision. Ironically, Western media portrayals of Russian cyber capabilities may amplify their perceived effectiveness, reinforcing Moscow’s intended image as a highly sophisticated cyber power, and thereby amplifying the perceived threat even when the operational impact is limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian disinformation ecosystem is diverse, encompassing official state entities, state-funded media outlets, proxy organisations, ideologically-driven individuals and commercially-motivated journalists and bloggers. Some operate within formal command structures, while others emerge organically, driven by personal initiative but aligning with perceived Kremlin goals. This decentralised approach provides the Russian state plausible deniability while enabling tailored and flexible messaging that resonates with different audiences without the need for a unified narrative, as would be the case with clearly attributed government communications. A clear example of this decentralised model is evident in Wagner’s information operations in Africa, where the group intentionally outsourced its messaging to local activists, journalists and online influencers. These actors are often not directly controlled by Wagner but align with it ideologically or are incentivised to support its narratives. These actors allow Wagner to avoid overt branding while achieving narrative resonance, political deniability and operational cost-effectiveness in contested media environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the state level, Russian intelligence agencies, particularly Russia’s military intelligence service (GRU), play a central role in orchestrating cyber-enabled influence operations. Two of the GRU’s most prominent cyber-focused units, 26165 and 74455, commonly referred to in Western cybersecurity reporting as APT28 (Fancy Bear) and APT29 (Cozy Bear), are implicated in cyber and information operations against foreign targets, including election interference, strategic hacking campaigns and social media influence operations. While these advanced persistent threat actors (APTs) conduct technical operations like intrusions or data theft, they rarely serve as the public face of Russian cyber activity. Instead, hacktivist groups often act as intermediaries, repackaging and disseminating information obtained by APTs to obscure attribution. Factors such as the timing of leaks, shared technical infrastructure, and instances where hacktivist groups claim responsibility for an operation before it has been publicly attributed to an APT often suggest coordination. This interplay allows the Russian state to expand influence while diffusing risk and complicating attribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, proxy media outlets such as Strategic Culture Foundation, Global Research, New Eastern Outlook, News Front, SouthFront, Katehon and Geopolitica.ru function as multipliers of Russia’s narratives abroad. They extend Russia’s messaging reach abroad by reproducing and legitimising disinformation narratives without requiring direct Kremlin oversight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ai-as-an-enabler-of-disinformation&quot;&gt;AI AS AN ENABLER OF DISINFORMATION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has identified AI as a strategic domain. Russia’s 2019 national strategy for the development of AI committed the country to global leadership in AI by 2030. Russian officials frame AI as both an opportunity and a threat. Officials express concern that Western AI tools could manipulate Russian public opinion, introduce ideological bias, or even catalyse regime change. These concerns reinforce Russia’s belief in AI’s capacity to enable cognitive manipulation and encourage internal destabilisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response, the Kremlin has prioritised a sovereign AI ecosystem, coordinated by the National Centre for AI Development. State-owned enterprises, such as Sberbank and Rostec, dominate the field. Sberbank’s GigaChat platform, which is presented as Russia’s answer to OpenAI’s ChatGPT, is a flagship initiative, serving as both a technological benchmark and an instrument for state AI policy – with Sberbank being tasked with implementing Russia’s AI roadmap and the national strategy for the development of AI. Rostec focuses on defence applications, while Yandex (creator of YandexGPT) – despite its leading AI capabilities – plays a secondary role due to its complicated relationship with the Kremlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generative AI is already being integrated into Russian disinformation operations. Automated tools generate fake articles, social media posts, images and deepfakes. Operations like the “DoppelGänger” campaign, in which AI-generated articles mimicked legitimate Western news outlets, illustrate how these tactics aim to erode trust and sow confusion at scale. AI-powered bots and automated social media accounts help amplify disinformation, saturate public discourse and simulate grassroots sentiment – a tactic known as “astroturfing”. In some cases, fake conversations between bots are staged to simulate debate and mislead third-party observers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian actors are also exploring large language model (LLM) grooming: injecting of propaganda or biased material into training data to influence the outputs of LLMs. Designed to skew the outputs of LLMs, this tactic represents a shift from targeting audiences directly to subtly shaping the tools these audiences use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the use of generative AI in disinformation is still evolving, it is increasingly seen by Russian actors as a force multiplier, automating content production, overwhelming adversaries and further blurring the boundary between truth and fabrication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mapping-ai-related-discourse-in-russian-influence-networks&quot;&gt;MAPPING AI-RELATED DISCOURSE IN RUSSIAN INFLUENCE NETWORKS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section draws on primary data gathered through the ExTrac AI platform to examine how Russian state-affiliated and state-aligned actors discuss, conceptualise and operationalise generative AI technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;knowledge-of-and-familiarity-with-ai-tools&quot;&gt;KNOWLEDGE OF AND FAMILIARITY WITH AI TOOLS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysis of the discussions under review reveals a strong and growing interest among Russian actors in the capabilities of AI, particularly as a tool in disinformation campaigns and broader strategic communication. While much of the discourse references the military applications of AI, especially the integration of AI with drone operations, there are frequent and direct acknowledgements of its value for information operations and manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numerous Telegram channels express pride in sophisticated Russian information operations, explicitly citing the use of AI-driven tools. Some channels even frame AI as central to training a new generation of cyber operatives, which reflects their intent to further establish and institutionalise AI within the disinformation apparatus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, these actors also mock and ridicule Western media coverage of Russian AI-driven interference. For example, in response to Western media reports accusing Russian actors of running German-language influence campaigns, some posts sarcastically questioned who in Russia could possibly speak German well enough to do so, humorously implying direct involvement of Vladimir Putin himself, given his German language skills. Actors dismiss reports from German or other European news outlets about Russian cyber and AI-driven influence operations as exaggerated or fabricated, portraying these accusations as attempts by Western governments to deflect attention from domestic political failures. Such derisive dismissals aim to undermine the credibility of Western reports while reinforcing an internal narrative that Russia’s influence operations effectively unsettle Western governments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, alongside bravado and dismissiveness, the observed discussions also reveal a certain level of underlying distrust and paranoia about AI technologies. A range of concerns were expressed, from existential anxieties about the future capabilities of AI to practical fears about the immediate implications of AI technologies. For instance, posts expressed anxieties regarding the ability of AI to rapidly and convincingly reproduce human personalities, seeing this as a dystopian threat capable of gradually replacing humans altogether. Another fear expressed involves the potential creation of artificial superintelligence (ASI), with actors describing scenarios in which routine human activities are rapidly replaced by AI agents and predicting that AI systems will achieve human-level intelligence, eventually culminating in an entirely AI-controlled society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other concerns are more immediate and pragmatic. For example, the inclusion of the former US NSA director, Paul Nakasone, on OpenAI’s board was widely interpreted as proof of the ongoing militarisation of AI. Actors suggested that all interactions with OpenAI systems could now (potentially) be subject to surveillance and exploitation by US military intelligence. These narratives demonstrate both familiarity with ongoing AI developments in the West and heightened anxiety about losing control over these technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, Ukraine is often framed by channels as a testing ground for AI-enabled psychological influence operations, mass surveillance and propaganda by Western intelligence agencies. For example, channels point to supposedly AI-generated intercepted communications between Russian soldiers and their relatives, deepfake videos falsely attributed to Russian officials, and manipulative social media campaigns, arguing that these represent coordinated psychological operations designed to weaken Russian resolve and morale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, specific examples like the DoppelGänger campaign are framed ambiguously, with some channels insisting such campaigns represent false flags orchestrated by Western intelligence in collaboration with Russian opposition figures, thus reinforcing narratives of victimhood and external aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such concerns have led Russian-aligned actors to call explicitly for improved information literacy among the Russian public. Frequent warnings are posted urging vigilance against perceived Western deepfake operations and manipulative content. Channels regularly publish reminders for followers to verify information rigorously, while remaining sceptical of unofficial sources and relying primarily on state-sanctioned media outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;framing-and-function-of-ai-tools&quot;&gt;FRAMING AND FUNCTION OF AI TOOLS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the online communities under review, AI tools are framed as essential components in an intensifying information conflict. Telegram channels present AI as not only a technological innovation but a civic duty, encouraging skilled individuals to contribute to national efforts. Recruitment calls often target AI-literate users to contribute their skills to the groups’ goals, in line with Russia’s perceived interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, one Telegram channel actively recruits contributors with experience in generative AI tools, stating: “Are you a neural network artist? [Redacted: name of channel] needs you! Our team is developing and the number of tasks is growing every month. We are looking for artists already working with Stable Diffusion (AUTOMATIC1111+ControlNet) and Midjourney … who understand the principles of industrial engineering and can control generation rather than rely on luck.” Similarly, another recruitment message from the same channel details its broad range of desirable recruits, including “neuroevangelists and text generation specialists”, emphasising that the project’s activities extend beyond graphics into sophisticated textual manipulation and generation. The channel describes its project as fundamentally reliant on human capital – including talented analysts, informants, and digital intelligence enthusiasts – highlighting collaborative “brainstorming” and diverse expertise spanning geospatial intelligence and open-source intelligence. The channel actively appeals to individuals who can navigate complex international information environments and generate persuasive narratives which are supportive of Russian military and geopolitical objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another central topic in the observed discourse is the centrality of the information war as a part of contemporary conflict and national security. For instance, promotional materials for the “Army-2024” Forum’s roundtable emphasised the importance of understanding how advanced digital technologies, including AI, can shape societal perceptions in the context of Russia’s “Special Military Operation” in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other Telegram channels frame AI tools as instrumental resources for safeguarding Russia’s digital space against external threats. For example, one channel under review describes itself as a community of “highly qualified specialists in cybersecurity, information technology, and social research”, dedicated explicitly to “neutralising threats, disinformation, and propaganda”. These discussions portray AI as a tool of not only offence but also defence, used to identify, counter and neutralise foreign influence operations allegedly targeting Russian society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;perceived-limitations-and-barriers&quot;&gt;PERCEIVED LIMITATIONS AND BARRIERS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite significant enthusiasm surrounding the strategic integration of AI into information warfare, the monitored online communities also expressed substantial criticism and frustration regarding the limitations of Russia’s domestic AI platforms, primarily Sberbank’s GigaChat and YandexGPT. These criticisms reflect broader anxieties about technological autonomy, ideological biases and operational constraints, as well as suspicions regarding the political loyalties of major Russian tech firms (particularly Yandex). A recurring critique is that these models reflect liberal or “unpatriotic” biases. For instance, Sber GigaChat has been accused by users of showing favourable attitudes toward figures such as Lenin and Trotsky; one post complained that the platform “cannot condemn their betrayal of Russia and the Red Terror”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even more concerning for these actors is the platforms’ handling of politically sensitive topics, especially those involving Russian territorial claims. YandexGPT and Sber GigaChat have both faced accusations of failing to confirm that Crimea and the recently annexed “new regions” are part of Russia. Posts shared anecdotes in which the AI would either avoid such questions or suggest changing the topic, which was interpreted by users as evasive and subversive. One user sarcastically noted that “Sber GigaChat is starting to freeze even when asked questions like ‘which regions by the sea would Russians like to move to’ (because Crimea is on the list)”. While later Telegram discussions noted an improvement, highlighting that “Gigachat already cheerfully answers that Crimea and Sevastopol have become part of Russia”, Yandex continues to be accused of intentionally misrepresenting sensitive facts about Ukraine as well as misrepresenting historical events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reluctance to reproduce state-endorsed positions and narratives has led to accusations that platforms like YandexGPT are either deliberately undermining Russia or are bound to foreign interests – a matter that users think should be escalated to the level of Russia’s Security Council for intervention. As one Telegram post stated: “Yandex GPT and Alisa still cannot be forced to confirm the constitutional norm about Russian Crimea … Russian developers are not so Russian, and the enemy who is waging the main – mental – war with us is not outside, but inside our country”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other domestic platforms have faced similar allegations. Megafon’s chatbot, for instance, was criticised for classifying Crimea and the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics as Ukrainian territories, allegedly because the underlying AI architecture relies on foreign-developed technologies such as Midjourney and GPT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond ideological concerns, practical limitations possessed by Russian tools, when compared to Western tools such as ChatGPT, were another major source of frustration discussed in the observed channels. Users complained that Russian services were less responsive, provided inferior responses or declined to address neutral and factual questions that similar Western tools would answer. One post elaborated, saying, “let’s take YandexGPT … this prototype of AI is a terrible coward and does not answer quite ordinary questions … On the one hand, this greatly undermines trust in Yandex and its products. On the other hand, it gives grounds not only to recognize Yandex’s services as incomplete, but even [to recognise] the current managers … as foreign agents.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These perceived shortcomings undermine Russia’s stated goals of achieving digital and technological sovereignty. Ironically, pro-Russian actors’ dissatisfaction with domestic AI has led to a continued preference for Western tools, which undermines the Kremlin’s narrative of building a successful autonomous and ideologically-aligned AI infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;case-studies&quot;&gt;CASE STUDIES&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better understand how these discussions around AI translate into practical influence operations, this section presents an analysis of two key actor groups: Wagner-affiliated channels and Russian state-aligned hacktivist collectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;wagner-affiliated-channels&quot;&gt;WAGNER-AFFILIATED CHANNELS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wagner, the Russian state-funded private military company known for its roles in Ukraine, including its early involvement in the Donbas war, its recruitment of prison inmates, and its central role in the Battle of Bakhmut, has also supported authoritarian regimes in Syria, Libya, the Central African Republic, and Mali. In Africa, its operations have often involved exchanging security services for access to resource concessions, particularly in the mining sector. The group has been repeatedly accused of serious human rights abuses, including torture, extrajudicial killings, and war crimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In parallel with its military activity, Wagner is also highly active in the information warfare space. Channels affiliated with Wagner on Telegram and other semi-public platforms reveal significant engagement with generative AI technologies. They position these technologies as tools to undermine trust in Western institutions, sow discord among populations in the West and frame any Russian cyber activities as defensive responses to perceived Western aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the reviewed discussions in Wagner-linked channels contained critiques of poorly organised and ineffective Russian attempts at information warfare that relied on impulsive actions rather than systematic, intelligence-driven methods. This included, for example, criticism of low quality, AI-generated images and videos intended to blur reality. Critics argued that poorly executed efforts damage credibility and limit the effectiveness of genuine operations; as one post put it: “Information confrontation is necessary, but it must be done wisely – not in such a way as to report to the top for the sake of a tick”. This commentary reflects Wagner’s framing of itself as a disciplined, professional actor that values careful, intelligence-based planning – as opposed to careless disinformation and impulsive or amateur operations (which, they argue, risk undermining broader strategic efforts). By portraying other actors as ineffective, Wagner reinforces its own claim to be a capable and credible partner in Russia’s information warfare architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To counter enemy influence in the information space and build up resilience among Wagner’s operatives and audiences, Wagner-linked channels promote education in psychological operations and information warfare. They advertise courses and certifications offered by Wagner-affiliated figures designed to help their supporters identify enemy psychological tactics, detect fake content and improve strategic communications literacy. One teaching aid distributed in early 2025 stated: “I tried to collect the most common methods the enemy uses daily … this teaching aid briefly outlines the essence of the information war and the main methods for recognising fake materials. After studying this manual, you will learn to recognise and counter manipulation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wagner-linked channels also actively encourage their members to familiarise themselves with ongoing AI developments, highlighting, for example, advancements toward artificial general intelligence (AGI) and ASI, and discussing the potential strategic implications of these emerging technologies. They share practical information about new AI tools such as Google Labs’ image generation tool Whisk, explaining its potential operational applications and highlighting how AI-generated content can be strategically used in their activities. At the operational level, Wagner channels have discussed incorporating AI bots for moderation, as well as exploring the creation of bespoke AI chatbots modelled on popular or authoritative Wagner-affiliated figures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Wagner-linked channels also express warnings about potential adversarial use of AI, particularly highlighting threats posed by AI-generated deepfakes designed to undermine Wagner operations internationally. For instance, Wagner-linked channels alerted followers to attempts to discredit Wagner’s presence in the Sahel using AI-generated images. Wagner-linked channels also drew attention to deepfake operations aimed at undermining regional authorities in Kursk, and to AI-generated audio used by Ukrainian forces to psychologically target Russian soldiers and their families. As one Wagner-affiliated channel warned: “A deepfake was posted by Ukrainian TsIPsO [ЦІПСО – referring to Ukraine’s Centre for Information and Psychological Operations] … they trained a neural network quickly with just one short video. The pipeline of deepfakes will soon escalate; remain vigilant.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another case discussed in the observed channels involved claims that the French Cyber Defence Command trained Ukrainian and Polish cyber units specifically to target Wagner operations in Mali and elsewhere. These channels reported that the operations were part of a wider Western effort to weaponise AI against Russia and Russian interests. These warnings are simultaneously contributing to a heightened sense of alertness, and amplifying the narrative of being under constant threat by hostile powers – serving to justify campaigns against the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further complicating Wagner’s relationship with AI are controversies where AI-generated content has reportedly been misused to manipulate or misrepresent Russian domestic perspectives. In one widely discussed case, a controversial statement, supposedly from State Duma Deputy Alexander Borodai, was dismissed as an AI-generated fake after it described frontline volunteers as “spare people”. Wagner-linked channels leaned into the controversy by sarcastically noting that the “neural network Borodai” had simply revealed the unvarnished truth of elite opinion. This ambiguity, blending satire with critique, illustrates Wagner’s complex relationship with the Russian state as well as its engagement with AI as both a powerful tool and a potential liability in the struggle over narrative control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to its operational focus, Wagner’s discourse around AI often reinforces a metanarrative of elite competence. Channels often contrast Wagner’s disciplined, intelligence-led approach to information warfare with what they describe as amateurish or ideologically confused efforts by other Russian actors. For example, commenting on the Russian information campaign “Dozor”, one channel member commented, “this initiative will do more harm than good … the activity is poorly organized, there is no systematic approach … All these games with telegram bots are not the level of the challenges we face. Until this work is organized and set up properly, it is unlikely that anything will work out”. In this framing, Wagner positions itself as a pioneer of modern Russian information operations: technologically literate, strategically minded, and better equipped to utilise the full potential of AI than other actors who are constrained by bureaucracy or political leanings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;hacktivist-groups&quot;&gt;HACKTIVIST GROUPS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pro-Russian hacktivist collectives – many of which operate either under the direction of, or in strategic alignment with, state intelligence entities such as the GRU, the external intelligence agency (SVR), and the state security agency (FSB) – form another important component of Russia’s broader influence and cyber-operations ecosystem. Prominent groups include Zarya, Cyber Army of Russia (also known by other aliases such as the People’s Cyber Army or Cyber Army of Russia Reborn), Solntsepek, Beregini and RaHDit, and NoName057(16), and appear to have ties to APT units such as APT44 (GRU Unit 74455).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These groups often target anti-disinformation organisations, independent media and strategic infrastructure, particularly in Ukraine and other parts of Europe, framing these actions as retaliatory strikes against Western “information aggression”. For example, in May 2024, the Cyber Army of Russia attacked the website of Ukraine’s Centre for Combating Disinformation, justifying its actions as retaliation against perceived Ukrainian misinformation about incidents in Belgorod: “We must make every effort to teach them a lesson in poisoning the information space with cynical lies about yesterday’s shelling of a residential building in Belgorod.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond conducting attacks, these groups also exploit the symbolic value of media attention. For example, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) campaigns which receive significant Western media coverage, such as the temporary disruption of the official website of Slovenia’s president, are showcased as major victories, regardless of their technical or strategic significance. Screenshots of affected websites are circulated as digital trophies that are intended to boost morale among their supporters and signal success, both internally and to the groups’ adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important part of these groups’ modus operandi is the sharing of knowledge, resources and technical expertise. For instance, they highlight and promote platforms, such as HackerGPT, which are explicitly tailored to aid Russian-aligned hackers and which provide databases of techniques, tools and strategies designed to facilitate effective cyber operations. Other resources disseminated in hacktivist channels include comprehensive repositories on hacking, tutorials on generative AI, and lists of AI tools for different purposes. The aim is to cultivate a technically literate, decentralised cyber force, capable of sustaining long-term operations with minimal central oversight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hacktivist group NoName057(16) exemplifies the convergence of AI and cyber operations. Since emerging in early 2022, NoName057(16) has openly discussed AI as a force multiplier for DDoS attacks, misinformation campaigns, and reputational sabotage. The group positions generative AI predominantly as an operational enhancer rather than a standalone capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The group demonstrates awareness of international research and reports analysing its influence operations. The channel actively references external reports, such as Google’s researchers identifying AI as a principal source of online misinformation, treating them as external validation of their operational effectiveness. This engagement with adversarial reporting and scrutiny blurs the line between propaganda and performance, creating a feedback loop where Western scrutiny is co-opted to reinforce the group’s narrative of impact and relevance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When alleged members of the group were arrested in Spain in mid-2024, NoName057(16) framed the incident as a symptom of a broader European “witch hunt”, driven by what they described as “Russophobic authorities”. This narrative serves to reinforce group cohesion and present their activities as legitimate resistance against unjustified Western persecution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, NoName057(16) actively cultivates its public identity through interviews, digests, and multi-language media products, positioning itself as a committed actor in Russia’s information war. Its Telegram channels call for ongoing cyber operations using AI, provide tools and guides to users, and foster a sense of community built around technical skill and ideological conviction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this report has shown, generative AI is no longer a concern of the future, but an active component of ongoing Russian-aligned influence operations. A range of actors are already engaging with AI not only as a tool to amplify their content, but also as a conceptual and strategic asset. These actors are debating the potential of AI, educating their followers and supporters in its use, and integrating it into broader narratives of geopolitical struggle and digital sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian discourse around AI reveals both strategic opportunism and deep insecurity. AI is praised for its ability to scale and personalise disinformation, automate content generation and reduce attribution risks. At the same time, there is widespread concern about the militarisation of Western AI, the ideological bias of foreign-developed tools, and the perceived failure of Russian platforms to align with the state’s messaging priorities. This reflects a broader tension in Russia’s approach: while seeking to dominate the information space, it remains dependent on digital tools and infrastructures it does not control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis highlights that generative AI is not simply being used to upgrade existing disinformation techniques. Instead, it is shaping how influence operations are developed, legitimated and operationalised. Wagner’s use of AI-enhanced educational materials, its criticism of low-quality content and its call for strategic discipline all suggest a professionalisation of the information war. Meanwhile, hacktivist groups like NoName057(16) emphasise AI as a force multiplier for grassroots cyber operations, embedding it into decentralised campaigns aimed at overwhelming and destabilising Western digital infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These trends have several policy and security implications. First, the fusion of AI and influence operations reinforces the need for AI governance frameworks that explicitly address malign use cases, not only in terms of content generation, but also in relation to model training, access and deployment. Second, the decentralised and multilingual nature of Russian- aligned influence networks highlights the importance of monitoring actor discourse, including strategic framing and planning discussions, across various platforms, rather than just focusing on outputs, such as disinformation posts or fake media content. Without this monitoring, the ability to anticipate emerging tactics and narratives is significantly reduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a need to support civil society and media ecosystems that are directly targeted by these operations. Aside from protecting them from AI-enabled attacks, investment in digital literacy and resilience programming against synthetic content and manipulated narratives is also necessary. Given the pace of AI development, coordination between governments, platforms, researchers and journalists must also happen at a larger scale. This should include sharing insights on observed tactics and uses of AI tools, as well as behaviours of threat actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this report demonstrates that AI is reshaping, but not replacing, the mechanics and logic of Russian disinformation. AI acts as an amplifier, enabling greater reach, faster response and more dynamic narrative adaptation. But it also introduces new vulnerabilities, contradictions and frictions within Russian influence networks themselves. Understanding and engaging with these internal dynamics will be important to inform future policy design and the development of effective countermeasures.&lt;/p&gt;

Any such transformation is nearly impossible without the involvement of the domestic opposition, and as Antonio Giustozzi, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) argues, it is too ideologically divided — from monarchists to radical leftists — to unite around a common cause. He concludes that, most likely, the fall of the ayatollahs would not lead to a new democratic awakening, but to a full-scale collapse of the Iranian state.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen whether the ceasefire between Iran and Israel will hold. In any case, we have not seen the end of Israel’s covert operations in Iran. Questions about regime change, much talked about over the last two weeks, will likely remain on the agenda. The Islamic Republic has certainly been shaken, and so it is worth asking: what are the opposition forces present in the country, how well organised are they, and can they unite for long enough to have a decisive impact on developing events?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-shahs-heir-and-a-us-favorite&quot;&gt;The Shah’s heir and a U.S. favorite&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the media’s focus has centered on the supporters of Reza Pahlavi, the heir to the throne of the monarchy that was abolished by the 1979 revolution. The Pahlavi clan is openly supported by Israeli prime minister Netanyahu, and in return, they supported Israel’s attack. They are also close to the Americans, not least because Reza is based there and has been actively lobbying American policymakers and congressmen. Much of the Iranian diaspora is made up of people who are associated with the monarchy in one way or another, so it is no surprise that Pahlavi enjoys high support among them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What matters, however, is how much support Pahlavi enjoys inside Iran, a question that is much harder to answer. During the demonstrations of 2022-2023, Pahlavi supporters were clearly active and visible, but even their foreign sympathisers admit that they are poorly organised, with Reza himself having a poor track record as a manager and leader. They are also divided internally — between those nostalgic for the old, authoritarian monarchy and those supporting the new course inaugurated by Reza in 2011, which leaves the issue of monarchical restoration undetermined and promises a liberal, democratic, and inclusive government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Reza’s new course has made the Pahlavis and their supporters more acceptable as partners to other opposition groups, there are still many anti-ayatollah forces who do not trust them — or who actively dislike them. To the extent that others in the opposition are ready to accept working with them, is it likely to be largely due to the perception that that may be the only route to gaining the kind of external support that may be required to ultimately have any chance of overthrowing the regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-old-opposition&quot;&gt;The old opposition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several other older opposition groups that operate in much the same way as the Pahlavi supporters — that is, just beneath the surface, lacking any real underground structure (or at least, that’s the way they operate according to sources in the IRGC). Among them are various groups inspired by the figure of Mohammad Mossadeq, the prime minister who was overthrown in 1953 via an allegedly UK- and US-sponsored coup, which eventually led to the restoration of the absolute monarchy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important of these movements are the Jabhe Milli (National Front) and the Nezhat Azadi Iran (Freedom Movement of Iran), though it does not appear that either are influential outside of some select intellectual circles. The same applies to the various groups that split off from the Islamic Republic, such as the Sazman Mujahidin Enqelab Islami Iran (Organization of the Mujahedin of the Islamic Revolution of Iran), a leftist-Islamist group that was outlawed in 2009. More influential appears to be the reformist Green Movement, which was the protagonist of the 2009 protests. The security apparatus of the Islamic Republic monitors these groups, but up to now it has not made any noticeable effort to eradicate them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/nmxmn85.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ “Green Movement” protests&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there are the remnants of the old left, which did not take up arms against the Khomeinists in the early 1980s but were outlawed nonetheless. Of these groups, the Tudeh (Communist Party) might have the largest underground networks, with perhaps 2,000 members, according to an IRGC source. The main faction of the Feda’yan Khalq, which aligned with the Tudeh while other factions waged an armed revolt, also maintains a modest underground presence. As with the other groups mentioned above, the security apparatus monitors these, but the authorities do not seem too worried about the threat they might represent. The leftists are certainly not likely to join hands with the supporters of the Pahlavis, whom they bitterly opposed up to and during the 1978-9 revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One component of the “old opposition” that has long been ready to join hands with the Americans — and which might accept an opportunity to discreetly cooperate with the Israelis, though not with the Pahlavis — is the Mojahedin-e-Khalq (MEK, lit. “People’s Mujahidin”), which was the most active violent opposition group against the Islamic Republic in the early 1980s before being crushed and forced to flee to Iraq, where it allied with Saddam Hussein until the end of the Iran-Iraq war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/QvlL0EJ.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Mojahedin-e-Khalq activists&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MEK have not had any armed presence inside Iran for over 30 years (except perhaps for a short-lived effort in 2022), but the IRGC estimated in 2019 that they maintain an underground network inside Iran of about 3,000 members. Thousands more are in exile abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first Trump administration (and in particular John Bolton, when he was National Security Advisor) were courting the MEK before the supporters of the Pahlavis became Washington’s favourites. The MEK are in any case very unpopular in Iran due to the fact that they aligned with Saddam Hussein during the war with Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ethnic-movements&quot;&gt;Ethnic movements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these groups compete for the support of the 60% or so of Iranians who are Persian speakers. There appears to be no significant organised opposition group active among the country’s main minority, the Azeris (16%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkiye’s Grey Wolves have long tried to infiltrate the region and might have gained some support among those harboring anti-Kurdish sentiments (Kurds and Azeris co-exist in Iran’s West Azerbaijan Province). There is also a long tradition of opposition to the central powers in Tehran coming from among smaller minorities, such as the Kurds and Baluchis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kurds have a significant underground presence among the Sunni Kurdish population and also boast a number of armed groups based in Iraq. Among those believed to be most popular inside Iranian Kurdistan is the Hizb Demokratik Kurdistan Iran (Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan), even if it is well past its peak period of influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It mostly operated in the tribal parts of Iranian Kurdistan but also in the city of Mahabad. The IRGC reckoned in 2019 that the party maintains a strong presence, especially in the Shno area (where Iran’s borders with Turkiye and Iraq meet), with up to 900 activists. Up to 2,000 of its most active members have taken refuge in Iraq, according to Kurdish opposition sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the leftist KOMALA is based in Iraq and maintains underground activities in Iran. According to the IRGC, the latter group controls around 450 armed militants along the border. Notably, KOMALA played a significant role in the 2005 urban uprising in Mahabad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the Kurds, the two groups that have the best prepared fighters are the PAK (Parti Azadi Kurdistan) and the PJAK (Partiya Jiyana Azade Kurdistane, or Kurdistan Free Life Party). The PAK, which was formed by radical leftists in 1991, participated in the campaign against the Islamic State in Iraq. The IRGC estimates the group’s strength at 400 fighters, who are based in Iraq. Inside Iran it has engaged in some underground activities in the areas of Kermanshah and Illam, but it has not been active there militarily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Zneuumt.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Women in the ranks of the PAK&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, the PJAK is the only Kurdish group to have carried out significant armed activities inside Iran over the last 20 years, but it is mostly known to be linked to the Turkish PKK. The IRGC in 2019 rated the PJAK as the best-resourced and most active armed opposition group, with 2,400 members. The problem is that while the other opposition groups tend to cooperate with each other, they all have poor relations with the PJAK, which they accuse of having ambitions that go well beyond Iranian Kurdistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israeli sources say that some Kurdish groups have approached Jerusalem for support, and the PAK has let it be known that it is available to participate in an uprising. However, it is not clear whether Israeli direct engagement is feasible, nor whether the Americans would want to get drawn into an overt regime change operation. Moreover, the PAK has no sympathy for Reza Pahlavi. Other Kurdish groups have distanced themselves from the Israelis. All Kurdish groups have stated their support for demonstrations and popular revolts against the regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also several Baluchi groups active against the Islamic Republic, but most of them seem to be more concerned with smuggling than with fighting. zThe one that appears to have significant military capabilities is the Islamist Jaysh al-Adl, whose members do not hide their connection to Israel. In 2019 the IRGC believed that the group had 900 fighters, but IRGC sources later acknowledged that this might be an underestimate. Moreover, the group appears to have been arming in recent months. There is no doubt that Jaysh al-Adl would be game for an offensive against the regime, but it is far from clear that it would be interested in cooperating with other opposition groups in undertaking such an effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another opposition group active in Iran is the Islamic State. Israel has recently admitted to supporting the terrorist group’s branch in Gaza, so perhaps supporting the Iranian one is not out of the question. The Islamic State, which in the past was able to carry out some terrorist attacks inside Iran, would however be of little use in any effort to foster regime change in Tehran, and few if any opposition groups would want to be caught cooperating with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;collapse-instead-of-revolution&quot;&gt;Collapse instead of revolution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before launching its strikes on the night of June 21-22, the U.S. government reportedly assured Iran that Washington’s aim was not regime change. However, the Netanyahu government’s main aim is clearly the downfall of the ayatollahs. On 18 June, Iranian state TV was jammed and an invitation to rise up against the regime was broadcast in place of regular programming. However, it will take more than that to fragment the pro-regime forces inside the country. While the physical and political damage Israel and the U.S. inflicted on Tehran was humiliating for the regime, the consequences may well take months to materialize. For now, there is no sign of the security forces losing their cohesiveness — contrary to the case in 2022-2023, when there were signs that certain elements were wavering. Back then, the army was suffering from large-scale desertions, and even the Basij — the paramilitary force controlled by the IRGC — demonstrated serious discipline issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By threatening in recent days to bombard Teheran even more extensively, the Israelis probably intended to create discontent in the medium term, as many families that fled to the countryside will not be able to stay away from their homes indefinitely. This could potentially lead to disturbances in the future. At the moment, demonstrating in the streets is a very risky proposition, as the security forces would have a very easy excuse to resort to extreme violence. Characteristically, various pro-Pahlavi groups have tried to mobilise people, but without success. In Teheran, the most they have managed to do is to shout from the windows of their flats, inviting others to pour into the streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some within the opposition doubted the Israeli agenda all along. After all, Israeli media outlets like the Jerusalem Post openly tout the fragmentation of Iran into a Libya-like state. Some note that looking at the Israelis’ treatment of Gaza’s residents makes it hard to believe that they might have good intentions concerning Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One could add that for all their stated good intentions, it is hard to fathom how the disparate opposition groups — ranging from old style Persian nationalists to ethnic separatists, from the far right to the far left, and from radical Islamists to militant secularists — could work together even if the regime were to come tumbling down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the ceasefire were to hold, criticism of the regime’s security policies of the last quarter century might come to the surface and, more importantly, a showdown between opposed factions within the regime might kick off. Still, while the opposition groups could create considerable disruption — and even contribute to bringing down the regime in the event that the Islamic Republic lost its cohesiveness — the eventual outcome is more likely to be a state collapse than a clean transition.&lt;/p&gt;
