  &lt;li&gt;法官裁定「共謀者原則」不適用於《國安法》生效前言行&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/EvWS8gA.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（2日）踏入審訊第62天。控辯雙方就「共謀者原則」作法律爭議3日後，3名《國安法》指定法官今裁定，「共謀者原則」只適用於2020年7月1日《國安法》生效後的共謀者言行，而《國安法》前的共謀者言行並不能納為該原則下的證據，只能以非傳聞證據的用途呈堂，意味不能依賴相關言行所述為事實來指證各被告參與本案串謀。而對辯方反對將匿名證人就新西協調會議的片段和錄音呈堂，法官指相關證據與本案有關，無充分理由拒絕呈堂，但同裁定僅可用作非傳聞證據的用途，詳細理由押後頒布。控方表示案情完結，林卓廷、黃碧雲、何桂藍及吳政亨表示擬申請毋須答辯，法官下令雙方呈交書面陳詞，並押至下周四（8日）處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;法官裁定國安法前言行不能納為共謀者原則下證據-包括匿名證人新西會議片段&quot;&gt;法官裁定《國安法》前言行不能納為「共謀者原則」下證據 包括匿名證人新西會議片段&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3名《國安法》指定法官今裁定，共謀者於2020年7月1日《國安法》生效前的言行並不能納為「共謀者原則」下的證據，但仍可以非傳聞證據的用途（non-hearsay purpose）呈堂。至於《國安法》生效後的共謀者言行，法官認為已滿足案例列明的條件，故「共謀者原則」適用。法官並強調，現時只處理證據呈堂性的問題，但就證據的比重未下任何決定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 早前反對匿名證人X的錄音和片段呈堂。法官今裁定，基於上述決定，相關證據亦不能在「共謀者原則」下呈堂，但仍可以非傳聞證據的用途呈堂；並指相關證據與考慮本案控罪有關，沒有充分理由運用酌情權剔除。法官會押後頒布詳細理由。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指引共謀者原則目的為證涉案言行真實性-辯方稱有相應門檻須符合&quot;&gt;控方指引「共謀者原則」目的為證涉案言行真實性 辯方稱有相應門檻須符合&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控辯雙方本周處理「共謀者原則」的法律爭議，涉控方能否引用「傳聞證據」指證各被告。「傳聞證據」指「聽人講」的證據，即「某人告訴法庭另一人曾對他說過什麼」。一般而言，考慮到相關證據未必可靠也未經盤問，「傳聞證據」在刑事審訊中不可呈堂，即不能依賴所述內容為真確來指證被告。但某些情況例外，如在「共謀者原則」下，其他共謀者的言行即使是「傳聞證據」，也可用作指證各被告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;綜合連日陳詞，辯方稱引用「共謀者原則」的前提為有證據顯示涉案串謀存在、亦有「獨立及合理的證據」顯示被告為串謀一分子，以及相關言行是為推動該串謀而進行；而被告加入串謀前的證據僅能顯示串謀的性質和範圍，只有此後的證據才能顯示被告的參與程度。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案中不少證據均屬傳聞證據，包括戴耀廷的文章、控方證人轉述戴耀廷的說法、前民主動力總幹事黎敬輝向趙家賢發出的協調會議筆記等，當中不少均於《國安法》生效前發生。辯方曾強調，《國安法》前的言行不構成任何罪行，「共謀者原則」並不適用；但控方指被告當時已涉串謀公職人員行為失當，具有非法的共同目的，故「共謀者原則」也適用於當時的言行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官曾指，即使沒有「共謀者原則」，《國安法》生效前的言行仍可作為背景或環境證供推論被告的犯罪意圖和思想狀態，及串謀的性質範圍。控方同意，但強調望引用該原則證明共謀者的言行內容屬實，以指證被告參與串謀。而根據法庭今天的裁定，即意味《國安法》前共謀者的言行，例如區諾軒引述戴耀廷稱已將協議文件發給參與者、趙家賢稱獲戴確認新東第二次會議曾投票通過「會運用」否決權、黎敬輝的協調會議筆記、新西協調會議的片段等，相關說法或內容都不能被視為真實以證明被告參與本案串謀；只能用作非傳聞證據的用途，如證明戴耀廷和黎敬輝的確有如此說過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/k3J0CRQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指已完成案情-黃碧雲等擬申毋須答辯-押下周四陳詞&quot;&gt;控方指已完成案情 黃碧雲等擬申毋須答辯 押下周四陳詞&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官宣布決定後，控方表示已完成控方案情，黃碧雲、林卓廷及何桂藍一方均表示擬作中段陳詞，要求毋須答辯（no case to answer），即爭議本案表面證供不成立。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表黃碧雲及林卓廷的大律師沈士文預計書面陳詞有40頁，惟法官陳慶偉指太長，亦認為沈指預計在下周五（9日）作口頭陳詞所需時間太長。代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 則指其陳詞會在10頁以內，陳慶偉指這正是他打算設下的頁數上限。代表吳政亨的大律師梁麗幗則指需時索取指示，吳或會要求毋須答辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉最後表示，各被告的書面陳詞不可多於10頁，並須於下周一（5日）前呈交控方及法庭，控方則須於下周三（7日）前呈交不多於30頁的回應，雙方於下周四（8日）作口頭陳詞。陳強調就頁數限制已是「非常慷慨（very generous）」，李運騰亦指若真的證據不足，辯方無需長篇幅交代，「你說得越多，機會就越少。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表鄭達鴻和梁國雄的大律師黃宇逸一度指，得悉沈士文的陳詞會提及有關法律的議題，望能保留對相關裁決的權利。法官質疑若他要作申請便提出，陳仲衡亦指「你不能做 freerider」，李運騰並指若法庭有相關裁決會適用於所有人，但現時尚未是時候處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官質疑控方花時間在無用證據上-控方致歉&quot;&gt;官質疑控方花時間在無用證據上 控方致歉&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，控方昨傳召一名警方社交媒體專家證人，就戴耀廷一則 Facebook 帖文作供，但由於他作供逾半小時，比起原先稱的5分鐘用更多時間，遭法官批評。署理助理刑事檢控專員羅天瑋今早甫開庭指，沒有其他問題向該警員發問。法官陳慶偉質疑為何控方要傳召該名警員，羅指因相關部分未納為同意事實，惟法官李運騰指似乎該部分僅對辯方有利。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉語帶不滿問：「為何需要花近一小時在無用的證據上？」在延伸庭的黃之鋒及吳敏兒均發笑。陳慶偉又向控方強調：「聽住，你要注視在整體大局上（look at the big picture）」，並問有關證據如何協助控方案情。此時副刑事檢控專員周天行站起代為回答，指由於該帖文提及同意運用否決權，而戴耀廷向參與者發出後獲回應，控方望依賴相關回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉不耐煩重申：「要看整體大局，而非只看微小的事情（“Look at the big picture, not only look at one tiny tiny tiny matter.”）」，周天行指有全面看，惟陳即追問：「那為何你會容許你的下屬（junior）在這方面花近一個小時？你是本案的主控！是你作出決定！」周天行遂向法官道歉，但陳慶偉不滿道：「這是沒有用的」，並指不能每次犯錯都只是道歉，但之後又繼續犯錯，延伸庭的吳敏兒及譚凱邦不禁發笑。周天行回應會善用相關證據，陳慶偉指對那不感興趣，並着他住口及坐下：「Shut up and sit down please!」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1zPCYMM.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下周四（8日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hkY6S1x.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（1日）踏入審訊第61天。控方今應法官要求提交列表，說明本案串謀形成、及各被告和共謀者加入串謀的時間。控方重申本案串謀於2020年1月飯局由區諾軒和戴耀廷形成，惟法官質疑區諾軒當時並無同意戴耀廷運用否決權的主張。控方又指，鄭達鴻出席公民黨記者會、公民黨以黨名義簽「墨落無悔」均可顯示鄭參與串謀，惟法官質疑並非所有公民黨黨員都是共謀者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，控方指前民主動力總幹事黎敬輝於參與協調會議時加入串謀，指會上談及否決預算案，黎知悉下仍多次出席會議和設計提名表格。惟法官質疑，黎只是受薪工作，不代表同意會上說法；又舉例法官受僱於司法機構才須每天出席審訊，但不代表同意控方說法，強調「單單知情從不足以令人成為串謀一分子」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方列表包括傳聞證供-官指不能用以顯示串謀存在&quot;&gt;控方列表包括傳聞證供 官指不能用以顯示串謀存在&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控辯雙方本周就「共謀者原則」作法律爭議，法官陳慶偉昨要求控方提交列表，列明本案串謀形成，及各被告和共謀者加入串謀顛覆國家政權的日期。控方今早向法庭及辯方提交列表，當中控方須有獨立證據證明被告參與串謀，才能援引「共謀者原則」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰甫開庭先指出，文件有部分段落顯示為藍色，示意為傳聞證據（hearsay evidence），該些證據須引「共謀者原則」才能呈堂；法官陳仲衡亦指，要顯示被告加入串謀便須有該些證據外的獨立證據。周天行指若然如此，可以不理會相關部分。法官陳慶偉其後指，控方不能同時用相關言行顯示串謀的存在，又再引「共謀者原則」指該些言行證明了其他共謀者說法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方稱串謀於2020年1月形成-官質疑區諾軒無同意戴耀廷稱否決財案&quot;&gt;控方稱串謀於2020年1月形成 官質疑區諾軒無同意戴耀廷稱否決財案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就串謀於何時形成，李運騰關注控方是否準確反映本案證據，舉例控方指由於2020年1月的飯局上戴耀廷提及「大殺傷力憲制武器」，故串謀當時已由戴耀廷和區諾軒形成。惟李指據他記憶，區諾軒無提及於飯局已同意戴耀廷稱運用否決權迫特首下台，區是在後來才意識到計劃的目的，區也沒被問及1月時是否已形成協議。周天行指最終會由法庭決定給予區諾軒證供多少比重，但認為表面上（prima facie）在飯局時，戴耀廷有與區諾軒談及否決權或「攬炒」，區在飯局後亦有作出一連串行為。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/lzy4F3o.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 副刑事檢控專員(III) 周天行&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟陳慶偉即指，區只是同意為35+計劃進行協調的行政工作，認為計劃只是為爭取立會過半才同意參與；而當時亦未決定是否採用公民投票。陳續指，區明確提及5月5日第二次新東會議後才有「風向轉變」，參與者始關注否決預算案的議題，而區稱一直不同意戴耀廷，只是沒提出反對。陳並語帶嚴厲問控方：「因此你怎能說2020年1月，串謀已經形成？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行回應，是依賴區諾軒一直知悉否決預算案的想法。陳慶偉指區或者知悉，「但我不關心他是否知悉，我關心他何時加入串謀。」周重申是2020年1月底。李運騰終無奈指：「如果這已是你能做到的最好，那就這樣吧。（“If that is the best that you can do, then so be it.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方稱鄭達鴻325公民黨記者會已加入串謀-稱顯示充分知悉黨立場-官質疑僅舉紙牌&quot;&gt;控方稱鄭達鴻3.25公民黨記者會已加入串謀 稱顯示充分知悉黨立場 官質疑僅舉紙牌&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續提到，控方指鄭達鴻於3月25日公民黨記者會已加入串謀，並列出另外7個後備日期。李指該記者會是否「35+計劃」的一部分有待決定，陳慶偉亦指記者會上「鄭達鴻除了拿着紙牌站在那裏，什麼都沒有做」。周指「至少能顯示他充分知悉（fully aware）公民黨的立場」，惟李指除了「知悉」，控方亦須有鄭以行動支持該說法的證據。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉亦指：「每個讀過戴耀廷文章的人都會知道他的意圖，但他們有沒有加入（串謀）？」周續解釋，控方並非只依賴3月的證據，亦依賴鄭達鴻之後的一連串行為，以讓法庭推斷他最早於3月已加入串謀。而對控方指鄭3月26日出席港島首次協調會議顯示參與串謀，陳慶偉質疑會上雖提出否決預算案，但司馬文提出反對，沒有達成共識，「你怎能說鄭達鴻於3月26日加入了串謀？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方承認無直接證據鄭達鴻收到協議文件&quot;&gt;控方承認無直接證據鄭達鴻收到協議文件&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方亦提及，5月19日港島初選參選人已就協議的字眼達成共識，戴耀廷並於6月8日將協議發出組織者群組。李運騰問有否證據顯示鄭達鴻於5月19日收到該份文件，周說可以作推論。李指區諾軒只是聽到戴耀廷稱已傳閱文件，追問控方基於什麼推論，周指是因鄭有出席會議。惟李笑指，區也曾稱協議文件不一定是會議的決議，只是戴耀廷嘗試加諸他人身上的個人意見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周在追問下，指可據6月8日戴耀廷發出的文件推論鄭有收到文件，惟同意鄭達鴻不在組織者群組，但指可顯示各區已達成共識，林卓廷輕聲說「嘩」。周最後承認並沒有直接證據鄭收到該文件，重申依賴法庭推斷。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方稱公民黨簽墨落顯示鄭達鴻加入串謀-官反問是否所有公民黨員都是共謀者&quot;&gt;控方稱公民黨簽「墨落」顯示鄭達鴻加入串謀 官反問是否所有公民黨員都是共謀者&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續引列表，指公民黨於6月11日簽署「墨落無悔」聲明書，但問為何控方指公民黨簽署就等於鄭達鴻加入了串謀。周天行答因鄭是公民黨黨員，惟李運騰問：「那是否代表所有公民黨黨員都變成了共謀者？當然不是。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李追問，控方立場是否指鄭於3月25日成了共謀者，而其他日子的證據均是讓法庭用作推論。周起初否認，陳慶偉續再追問，周一度望着法官靜默，陳說「不要望着我」。周續同意，列表上所有證據均可用以推論鄭達鴻於3月25日已加入串謀，而若法庭不同意該日期，則可採納之後的後備日期，而所有證據均可用來佐證。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問有何證據黎敬輝為共謀者-指黎屬民動總幹事設計提名表格屬工作&quot;&gt;官問有何證據黎敬輝為共謀者 指黎屬民動總幹事、設計提名表格屬工作&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，控方亦指前觀塘區議會主席蔡澤鴻、前民主動力總幹事黎敬輝，及前公民黨立法會議員郭榮鏗為共謀者。就黎敬輝，控方指他於3月26日首次港島協調會議加入串謀。惟李運騰指，黎只是被趙家賢要求出席會議，問除了他在場抄筆記外，還有沒有其他獨立證據顯示他是串謀的一分子。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行指黎也是民主動力總幹事。李運騰即笑說：「但這是他的工作。」周回應，即使協調會議有談及否決預算案，黎仍多次（repeatedly）出席會議。陳慶偉即提高聲調說：「這是他的工作！他的工作！他必須在那裡！拜託！（“It’s his job! His job! He has to be there! Please!”」周天行指黎也有設計提名表格，李運騰指那不代表他同意當中內容。陳慶偉亦指黎是民主動力總幹事、是唯一的全職員工，「如果不是他設計，那由誰設計？」周回應表格有顯示計劃的「共識」，惟陳指那是另一議題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉再追問還有什麼證據顯示黎是共謀者，周指「基本上這就是我們的所有證據」，陳再語帶不耐煩，語氣稍重說：「聽着！因為我是香港政府司法機構的員工，所以我才每天要來這裡，記錄你說的話」，李運騰亦指「不代表我們同意你的說法」。周僅重申是因黎有出席協調會議，陳慶偉再大聲問：「除了那以外，還有什麼？」周再答：「那就是我們所有的。（“I think that is all we have.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰總結，控方立場是否即由於黎出席會議，為35+計劃提供支援，所以他自願支持整個計劃，周同意，亦同意法官指趙家賢曾稱民主動力工作報告是由職員所撰寫，故不僅依賴黎出席會議來顯示他為共謀者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官稱黎敬輝僅會議出席者單單知情不足以成為串謀一分子&quot;&gt;官稱黎敬輝僅會議出席者、單單知情不足以成為串謀一分子&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就控方指黎敬輝於3月26日首次港島會議加入串謀，李運騰重申當天會上戴耀廷雖談及否決預算案，但對此無共識，「他（黎敬輝）可能聽過（戴耀廷說法），但這令他成為串謀一分子嗎？」，指聽過不代表同意，陳仲衡亦指黎也有聽到會上反對運用否決權的看法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周續指，黎有出席的5月8日新西會議上「會運用」獲一致通過，惟李運騰再指黎嚴格來說並非計劃參與者（participant），只是會議出席者（attendee）。周重申因黎「一直都知道（否決預算案的想法）」，惟李強調「單單知情從不足以令人成為串謀一分子（“Knowledge alone is never sufficient to make one a party to conspiracy.”）」，周天行同意，並指是依賴一連串行為來推論黎參與了串謀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問郭榮鏗於35角色指郭無參加初選-控方指曾出席宣傳初選街站&quot;&gt;官問郭榮鏗於35+角色、指郭無參加初選 控方指曾出席宣傳初選街站&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於郭榮鏗，控方同指他於3月25日公民黨記者會加入串謀。李運騰問，除了他在場並支持會上發言，他在整個「35+計劃」有何角色？直言「他從沒參與任何協調會議、從沒參加初選」。周天行指郭於該記者會上發言、亦是公民黨一員，其後公民黨也有簽署「墨落無悔」。李重申並非所有公民黨員都成為共謀者，周指他不是說所有黨員都是，李追問那為何要單獨挑出郭，周再重複指因郭在記者會上發言，並於7月12日出席公民黨街站。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;由於今早始收到控方列表，辯方表示需時準備，押後約一小時作出回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Q5E0fgP.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，踏入審訊第61天。控方應法官要求交代各被告和共謀者加入串謀的時間，並列出可顯示被告參與串謀的證據。惟多名辯方大狀均指相關證據不充分，亦強調本案不曾達成無差別否決預算案的協議，只是從政者嘗試參與初選和表達一些主張，即使有協議也只是同意舉行初選為民主派爭勝算。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其中吳政亨被控方指為組織者，其代表大狀強調吳雖與戴耀廷有聯繫並發起「三投三不投」約束初選參選人，但吳僅着重團結民主派，無意加入戴耀廷無差別否決預算案的串謀，與戴耀廷即使達成協議，也與本案協議不同。法官周五（2日）將就控方能否援引「共謀者原則」作出裁決。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方提名表格和收據無說明各區確實達成之共識-不足以顯示參與串謀&quot;&gt;辯方：提名表格和收據無說明各區確實達成之共識 不足以顯示參與串謀&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今應法官要求提交各被告和共謀者加入串謀日期的列表，遭法官多番質疑，辯方其後進行回應。代表黃碧雲和林卓廷的大律師沈士文重申，《國安法》生效前的共謀者言行不能在「共謀者原則」下指證各被告，如要應用該原則便須先有獨立合理證據證明有串謀存在。而該原則如適用，則以被告加入串謀的日子為分界，此前的傳聞證據（hearsay evidence）均不得在該原則下呈堂，僅能顯示串謀的性質和範圍，只有此後的證據才能顯示被告的參與程度。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈並指，控方依賴被告報名初選的提名表格和按金收據作為各被告參與串謀的證據，但該兩份文件本身並沒有說明各區確實達成的共識，不足以證明被告參與串謀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方搜林卓廷筆記提積極運用否決權-辯方稱或有他人準備初選論壇言論相反&quot;&gt;控方搜林卓廷筆記提積極運用否決權 辯方稱或有他人準備、初選論壇言論相反&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就控方指從林卓廷家搜得「初選Debate Notes」可顯示他參與串謀，當中就會否反對預算案，筆記稱「胡志偉一再公開回應話會積極運用」和「其實我立法會四年沒有贊成過財政預算案」。沈士文指筆記從沒被使用，可能由他人準備，即使由林準備也可能只是草稿或出錯；又指林在初選論壇表明若政府建醫院和學校就不會否決預算案，直言不能顯示林同意該筆記內容。李運騰表示控方或指可從所有證據作推論，惟沈指那是不能接受。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於控方指從黃碧雲電腦搜得九龍西的協議文件，沈指不代表是由戴耀廷發給她。李運騰指若黃有該文件，或能推論她是知悉文件內容下報名參加初選，合理推論她參與串謀，惟沈認為仍不足夠；沈亦指，黃沒有如控方稱出席首次九西協調會議，據區諾軒稱會議亦無就否決財案達成共識，而黃於初選論壇僅稱可用不同《基本法》權力爭取五大訴求，無證據她同意無差別否決。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方稱初選僅從政者表達主張無達成協議公民黨簽墨落不代表鄭達鴻認同&quot;&gt;辯方稱初選僅從政者表達主張無達成協議、公民黨簽「墨落」不代表鄭達鴻認同&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表鄭達鴻和梁國雄的大律師黃宇逸則重申，區諾軒作供時稱與戴耀廷的「初心」不同，無明確證據協議何時形成。他亦認為公民黨簽署「墨落無悔」不能代表鄭達鴻，指所有其他參與者均以個人名義簽署，只有公民黨以黨名義簽署，背後一定有原因。黃又指鄭只是在3月25日公民黨記者會上站着舉紙牌，不足以證明當時已加入串謀。惟陳慶偉指，若鄭於會上只是單單站着望向某處，可接受他未必同意會上內容，李運騰補充或者他搖頭示意；陳仲衡亦指需考慮所有因素，包括鄭參與初選等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃宇逸強調，本案任何階段均沒有達成涉案串謀協議，只是從政者嘗試參與初選和表達一些主張，李運騰笑指即是他們說出誇大的話而沒有意圖實踐，黃笑言「基本上那是所有從政者做的事」，李稱不肯定他的當事人會否同意。黃亦指，無證據鄭達鴻和梁國雄收到協議文件，而控方有關郭榮鏗是共謀者的證據薄弱（flimsy），李運騰回應法庭會仔細審視控方依賴的每則證據。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表楊雪盈的大律師張耀良則指，控方依賴趙家賢稱楊出席首次港島會議，惟趙當天遲到早走，相反區諾軒負責協調該區，記憶較可靠，而區稱楊僅派代表出席。張又指，區稱港島所有會議均無就否決財案達共識，惟法官陳慶偉不同意，指由於司馬文反對運用否決權而退出初選，可見會上一定有達成協議。但張表示對說法存疑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;多名辯方大狀均指本案沒有達成無差別否決預算案的協議，包括代表彭卓棋的大律師盧敏儀和代表何啟明的大律師阮偉明。阮指即使有協議，也只是舉行初選爭取民主派立會勝算的協議。自行代表的劉偉聰亦反對控方所有指稱他加入串謀的日期，認為沒有任何獨立證據顯示他參與涉案串謀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表施德來的大律師黃廷光亦認為沒有任何串謀，也無證據證施參與串謀；並認為控方指為共謀者的蔡澤鴻情況與前民主動力總幹事黎敬輝相若，只是於35+計劃進行後勤（logistic）工作。惟法官李運騰不同意，認為蔡的參與更多，負責組織九東協調會議、發電郵、提供開會場地和協助主持會議，會後亦向與會者發送文件，非單純的與會者；又指蔡曾向組織者稱九東參選人望簽協議、否則會「兵變」，因此施德來等人才提交共同綱領。李運騰又問為何關注蔡澤鴻，指即使他非共謀者，若施與戴耀廷達成串謀協議，相關證據也可納入考慮；黃指若蔡非共謀者，其證據便不可用來指證參選九東的施。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指墨落不代表倡無差別否決財案提名表格僅限協調會議共識&quot;&gt;辯方指「墨落」不代表倡無差別否決財案、提名表格僅限協調會議共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表鄒家成的大律師陳世傑則表示，就控方援引4月14日會上鄒家成提及「要用盡方法去迫政府回應五大訴求」，只是趙家賢的證供，惟趙會上不專注，供詞與區諾軒和鍾錦麟不一致，若依賴或有疑慮。至於控方援引新東協議文件，陳指區諾軒亦不肯定是否如實反映各人共識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就5月5日新東第二次會議，陳指會上或有激烈討論否決權，但最終投票不果。陳慶偉指是鄒家成要求投票，其他人不同意，「那不是反映他想加入戴耀廷的串謀嗎？」陳世傑回應控罪並非只指一兩個人串謀，而是所有被告。陳慶偉指那不重要，李運騰亦指只要有人與戴耀廷達成協議便可成立，與其他被告是否無辜無關。陳世傑另指，「墨落無悔」並無提倡無差別否決預算案，而提名表格列明要同意的亦僅限於協調會議上的共識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方批控方列出後備日期讓法庭決定做法不能接受&quot;&gt;辯方批控方列出後備日期讓法庭決定做法不能接受&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑最後就控方列出後備日期的做法回應，認為控方應有清晰的立場，如說「Plan B」就是「Plan B」，而不是列出「Plan A至Z」，再讓法庭決定，指做法是不能接受，李運騰微笑說法庭今早已表達過相似的情緒。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表李予信的大律師關文渭則指，部分控方證據為傳聞證供、不能接納，包括無證據李曾收過超級區議會的協議文件；就「公民黨」簽署「墨落無悔」也無清楚證據顯示何為公民黨，李運騰一度回應是已通過清盤的政黨。關又指在6月的公民黨街站李予信沒有發言，惟法官指李當天在場或可證他支持。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指吳政亨與戴耀廷達成的協議與本案指控不同僅關注初選是否具約束力&quot;&gt;辯方指吳政亨與戴耀廷達成的協議與本案指控不同、僅關注初選是否具約束力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表吳政亨和余慧明的大律師石書銘則表示，控方以吳政亨與戴耀廷於3月的 WhatsApp 對話紀錄指吳參與串謀，但該些對話不能得出二人共同目的就是否決預算案。李運騰稱控方是指雖然吳沒參選，但透過發起「三投三不投」確保參選人服從協調機制，支持「35+計劃」；石書銘同意，但強調控方是指控被告同意無差別否決預算案，而上述證據或未能指向此，同意法官總結吳參與的串謀與本案控罪不同。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石書銘其後援引吳政亨文章〈【初選聯署】立會有初選啦！但有無約束力？睇你簽唔簽名〉，提及「執筆之時，戴耀廷教授剛於訪問中透露直選協調進展」，又指「好消息當然是五區協調成功」。李運騰質疑若吳作為局外人，為何會得知發生何事；陳慶偉亦指文章提及「怎料，看了細節，比預期更佳！先前傳聞令一衆候選人爭持不下的『共同綱領』，也達到完滿結果。所有參與會議的五區候選人都同意簽署協議書『會（積極）運用』基本法賦予權力，包括否決財政預算案」，指吳似乎也讀過共同綱領。惟石指吳只是從戴耀廷訪問以及「先前傳聞」得知，吳亦沒有表明是否同意運用否決權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石又指，吳的重點是在團結民主派，而本案所有證據也顯示他只關注初選是否具約束力，沒有提過否決預算案。而他與戴耀廷最後一次 WhatsApp 對話是2020年7月3日，之後二人沒有對話，吳並於7月28日與戴講再見。惟法官李運騰指，吳政亨也在《蘋果日報》就初選登廣告並發給戴，亦曾就撰寫的新聞稿徵詢戴意見，並要求戴向其他參選人分發，戴回應已辦妥。石書銘強調，無論吳政亨和戴耀廷同意了什麼，也是與本案不同的另一個串謀，該協議的範圍也很有限。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官以打劫為喻問知情而買車者是否共謀-辯方強調吳政亨無意加入否決財案串謀&quot;&gt;官以打劫為喻問知情而買車者是否共謀 辯方強調吳政亨無意加入否決財案串謀&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉其後主動打比喻，假設三名法官計劃打劫銀行，而他的書記雖然不認識其餘兩人、也不知計劃細節，但得悉大概的計劃後與陳達成協議，同意為陳買車和擔任司機，那書記是否本案的共謀者？二人的串謀協議與打劫計劃是否分開？並指書記可類比吳政亨。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石回應被告要定罪不僅在於他知情、亦需同意該共同目的，惟吳政亨的情況不同。但陳仲衡指，石援引的文章正顯示吳知道35+是關於否決預算案；李運騰亦指被告不一定需「打劫」，只是參與整個計劃的一部分也可入罪。石重申吳無意加入戴耀廷無差別否決預算案的串謀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;法官周五就能否引共謀者原則頒決定&quot;&gt;法官周五就能否引「共謀者原則」頒決定&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉終表示，將於周五（2日）就能否援引「共謀者原則」作出裁決，其中黃碧雲、林卓廷、何啟明、何桂藍等或會視乎結果提出毋須答辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後應石書銘要求傳召一名警方社交媒體專家證人作盤問，控方亦另傳召一名警方社交媒體專家證人，就戴耀廷一則帖文作供。法官李運騰一度驚訝指以為控方已傳畢所有證人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就第二名證人，控方原稱只需5分鐘，惟最終該證人作供逾半小時仍未完成。陳慶偉面露不快，大聲叫控方問好問題，又質問控方為何只稱需5分鐘，並將案件押至明早續。&lt;/p&gt;

More recently, Riyadh has engaged in new diplomatic moves towards Canada, a country with which it has had a rocky relationship. All of these moves follow a particular pattern, and we are likely to see more of the same.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jonathan Eyal (&lt;strong&gt;JE&lt;/strong&gt;) asked our Senior Associate Fellow, H A Hellyer (&lt;strong&gt;HH&lt;/strong&gt;), about the significance of these events.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JE:&lt;/strong&gt; What do you think Saudi Arabia was looking to accomplish in this latest flurry of diplomatic engagement at the Arab League? Is it an isolated move?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;HH:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Riyadh was the host for this particular Arab League summit, so it’s natural enough that the meeting might take something of a Saudi flavour to it. But Riyadh went beyond that, and that’s down to the current Saudi leadership’s overall foreign policy agenda matching its domestic policy agenda. Foreign observers will be looking at the impacts on relations with the West, Israel and so on – but really, Riyadh’s focus is on the domestic arena, and its geopolitical relationships – alongside its formulation of its own regional position – are critically linked to that focus. So, no, it’s not an isolated move, and it’s very much about the leadership’s overall vision for the Kingdom. For lack of a better expression, one might call it the “turning the page” approach, which is closely connected to Riyadh’s “Vision 2030”, a phrase that came out of Saudi Arabia’s comments at the Arab League.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JE:&lt;/strong&gt; So, there is a macro-level strategy at work here, this “turning the page” approach – can you lay out what this means more generally?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;HH:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Riyadh has been on a geopolitical offensive, after dealing with the fallout from its (admittedly rather brief) pariah status in the West which followed particularly from the murder of Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, as well as to some extent the Saudi-led war in Yemen. The leadership has been keen to build bridges with Western capitals, especially Washington, and has clearly banked on the idea that if it waits it out, Western leaders and elites will eventually move past their antipathy towards the Kingdom. There’s been a lot of attention towards all of this, and it perhaps reminds us that in international relations, there are no permanent allies or permanent enemies, but permanent interests, as Lord Palmerstone famously said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This geopolitical offensive is most interesting in terms of regional dynamics, though. The Khashoggi affair led to strained relations with Turkey, where the murder took place; but the Saudi leadership took up the opportunity to mend ties with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan once an overture was made, presumably due to Turkey’s economic woes. The Saudis had led efforts to isolate Qatar in 2017, but they were also the ones who ended the GCC-wide spat, despite objections within their own camp. The Saudis have expressed incredible antagonism vis-à-vis Iran and its regime, but despite no change in Tehran’s behaviour, Riyadh has recently de-escalated with the Iranians too. More moves have taken place with regards to Yemen as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this means that the Saudis have been perfect in how they’ve engaged regionally, or that they’ve suddenly done a 360 in terms of their view of the world. Rather, it means they’ve decided that it is in the Kingdom’s interest to have fewer conflicts to deal with externally, and I think that’s because they want to focus their energies internally as much as possible. The Arab League meeting was more evidence of this strategy playing out. And then there was the normalisation of diplomatic relations with Canada, following the fallout in 2018 over Canadian diplomatic representations in favour of women’s rights activists in Saudi Arabia; an agreement to return ambassadors was reached in late May. “Turning the page” indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JE:&lt;/strong&gt; What did Riyadh seek to accomplish with regards to the West and Ukraine at the Arab League?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;HH:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; It’s interesting. Saudi Arabia is no doubt aware that there is antipathy vis-à-vis Ukraine in much of the Global South, while at the same time there is full support for Kyiv against the Russian invasion in the West. Riyadh didn’t invite the Ukrainian president as part of a joint decision by various Arab League member states – it took the decision pretty much unilaterally, which seemed to ruffle a few feathers due to some Arab states’ alignments with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Holding off from normalisation with Israel makes Riyadh stronger in the regional and international context, because it means there is still a bargain to be struck&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Riyadh gained substantial and significant credit with Western capitals by doing so. Zelensky is iconic now; he is the only Western leader involved in a direct military conflict with a competitor of the West (Russia) on the global stage. Moreover, he is involved in that conflict as the result of a defensive action – Ukraine didn’t invade Russia, Russia invaded Ukraine – and that makes him a resistance leader of great stature across the West. It was Riyadh that brought Zelensky into direct conversation with senior representatives from across the Arab world, to make his case and state his purpose. No one else has done that in the region, and as such the Saudi move is going to play quite well in Western capitals – not least in Washington and anywhere where solidarity with Ukraine is perceived as a crucial and critical Western interest. It doesn’t hit the reset button on Saudi-Western relations, but it certainly helps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JE:&lt;/strong&gt; But the West is also concerned about other issues with regards to Saudi Arabia, particularly the Abraham Accords – how has this played out?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;HH:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; There has been a push in parts of the DC “Beltway” to get Riyadh to accede to the Abraham Accords, despite Saudi Arabia’s repeated refusal to do so. Maybe one day Riyadh will sign up, but the current mood in the Kingdom is not remotely sympathetic to such a step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, from the Israeli perspective, normalisation with Riyadh would be an achievement of epic proportions, and Netanyahu is clearly trying to find any way to make it happen. This is perhaps because he hopes that massive economic investment will follow, which would serve as a “great diversion” from Israel’s domestic political woes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s just one small issue with this strategy: there is little upside to acceding to the Abraham Accords that Riyadh cannot already attain. Normalisation would not strengthen Riyadh’s regional position. On the contrary: holding off from official normalisation makes Riyadh stronger in the regional and international context, because it means there is still a bargain to be struck – thus giving the Kingdom a modicum of leverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DC correctly understands that while the region is not made up of democratic regimes, public opinion does have an impact (even if it’s not remotely as critical as in electoral systems). Normalising with the most right-wing government in Israeli history is hardly attractive to Riyadh. The most stalwart of the Abraham Accords signatories is the UAE, and a prominent Emirati figure recently declared that no more Arab states would normalise ties with the Israelis, as the Israeli government was “putting everyone off” – indeed, she went as far as to say that her own government was “embarrassed in front of the Arab people”. Riyadh is certainly not interested in being put in the same position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Syria’s reintegration may come back to haunt Riyadh. Assad hasn’t changed, and his regime continues to be unstable, even with Russian and Iranian backing&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, there may be a time when the calculus changes for Riyadh, but it’s not now – especially not with continued US congressional antipathy towards Riyadh, which makes it unlikely that DC could provide sufficient incentives to Saudi Arabia that would also be able to pass through Congress. It’s a bit peculiar that the idea of normalisation keeps being raised, especially when a US official said this month – albeit off the record – that recent statements by Saudi officials should “put to rest talk of a major US push for Saudi-Israeli normalisation”, and that the talks were “a campaign full of hot air blown by well-meaning folks mostly in Israel”. Ideological aspirations aside, I think the trend is pretty clear, hence Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s repeating of demands for an end to the Israeli occupation and for the general parameters of the Arab Peace Initiative of 2002 – which was itself a Saudi enterprise – to be adhered to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JE:&lt;/strong&gt; The event that was all too evident in advance was Bashar al-Assad’s appearance. Saudi Arabia backed his exclusion from the League for years, but recently that’s changed. What are you seeing there?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;HH:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; On Syria, Riyadh didn’t begin the push for normalisation with Assad’s regime. But it did run with it, and hard. This is all part of Riyadh’s calculation that its domestic agenda requires de-escalation in its regional policy, so that its full attention is focused within.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Assad’s reintegration may come back to haunt Riyadh. Assad hasn’t changed, and his regime continues to be unstable, even with Russian and Iranian backing. There are millions of Syrians who view Assad as the most brutal leader in their history, and that isn’t a recipe for good times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assad’s Syria is often described as a new “narco-state” in the Middle East, and that is also a source of societal instability for regional states. Yes, the Arab League suggested “conditions” for reintegration, but this conditionality isn’t going to be taken seriously at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was Riyadh that pushed the normalisation through, going over the heads of a number of states that were not ready for this step. Even its former adversary in the GCC (Qatar) has fully accepted Riyadh’s pole position in the region, and is keen not to take steps that would cause tensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JE:&lt;/strong&gt; How does this all bode for the future?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;HH:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The Turkish AK Party promulgated its “Zero-Problems” approach to regional dynamics some two decades ago, including in its electoral platform a promise to “improve relations with Turkey’s neighbours”. Of course, Ankara faced a lot of problems in trying to uphold this pledge, and in recent years it has engaged in far more confrontational moves. To draw another parallel, the “ethical foreign policy” approach of the early years of the Tony Blair government in the UK gave way to the Iraq War in 2003; political events often take on lives of their own which go far beyond expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all that being said, I suspect we will see further moves towards de-escalation from Riyadh. In Sudan, where the Sudanese army is engaged in a power struggle against an assorted group of militias, Riyadh is trying to de-escalate the situation; in Lebanon, I think we’ll also see moves by Saudi Arabia to reduce tensions. It’s less about Riyadh trying to cast itself in a new role of regional mediator, in my opinion, and more a reflection of the fact that as Riyadh focuses more of its energy internally, it wants fewer distractions or spoilers externally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（31日）踏入審訊第60天，續處理「共謀者原則」的法律爭議。法官陳慶偉今表示，被告何時加入串謀屬重要，惟控方沒有說明，要求控方明天提交各被告及共謀者加入串謀日期的列表。控方在法官追問下，指若法庭不同意本案於2020年1月飯局已形成串謀，下個形成串謀的日期為3月25日公民黨記者會，惟法官質疑該記者會與戴耀廷和區諾軒無關，亦指似乎無證據前民主動力總幹事黎敬輝為共謀者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對控方指被告或涉「公職人員行為失當罪」，辯方質疑不能與「顛覆國家政權罪」類比，而被告《國安法》生效前未必能預料當時言行或違法，控方以此指證被告構成不公；又指控方引用的美國案例與共謀者原則無關，對本案無約束力。法官多番追問，該案例有否提及控罪生效前已形成串謀協議，並指若然如此便需慎交朋友，否則朋友日後犯事，即使以往交往多清白，也可能成為犯罪言行。控方最終承認案例沒有如此提及。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官數度追問串謀形成日期-控方一度稱325公民黨記者會-官質疑與戴耀廷無關&quot;&gt;官數度追問串謀形成日期 控方一度稱3.25公民黨記者會 官質疑與戴耀廷無關&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控辯雙方前日（29日）就能否於本案援引「共謀者原則」陳詞，案件押至今續。法官陳慶偉甫開庭先澄清辯方立場，以戴耀廷文章為例，指據現時的同意事實和證據，似乎除了代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 外，相關證據的呈堂性並沒有被挑戰，可納為環境證供，辯方只是爭議控方使用證據的目的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，因此據控陳詞，似乎被告何時加入串謀屬重要，但控方並沒有明確說明，並指控方說法是串謀於2020年1月已由戴耀廷和區諾軒形成，問若法庭不同意這個日子，控方指串謀開始的下一個日期是何時？主控周天行指是3月25日，因公民黨當天舉行記者會。惟法官李運騰和陳慶偉即指，該記者會與戴耀廷和區諾軒無關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續問，若法庭不同意3月25日的日子，下一個日期會是何時？周天行指是6月8日，因當天趙家賢要求戴耀廷發送最終協議文件。陳再問，若不同意6月8日呢？周天行指是被告提交提名表格的日子，陳即反問為何不是6月9日的初選記者會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官要求表列被告及共謀者加入串謀時間指看來無證據黎敬輝是共謀者&quot;&gt;官要求表列被告及共謀者加入串謀時間、指看來無證據黎敬輝是共謀者&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行未回答，李運騰便指若控方是指串謀首先由組織者如戴耀廷、區諾軒和趙家賢等形成，可理解控方指串謀是由6月8日開始；但其他被告或於不同時間加入串謀。他並指，控方就被告加入串謀之前和之後的證據在「共謀者原則」下的使用有所區分，控方指被告加入前其他共謀者的言行可顯示串謀的性質和範圍，而被告加入後，相關言行便可顯示其參與，因此控方須說明每名被告何時加入串謀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉補充，不止是被告，還包括控方指同為共謀者的前觀塘區議會主席蔡澤鴻、前民主動力總幹事黎敬輝，及前公民黨立法會議員郭榮鏗，認為控方要準備顯示每名被告和串謀者加入串謀日期的列表。李運騰並指，特別關注為何控方指黎敬輝是串謀的一分子，以及有何獨立證據證明黎是共謀者之一，笑指現時所有有關黎的資料都是由趙家賢提供，但表面看來沒有證據顯示他是共謀者，因黎只是被要求出席會議和抄筆記，「他不是在那裡發表任何個人意見。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方一度稱未能列加入確實時間-後同意明日交列表&quot;&gt;控方一度稱未能列加入確實時間 後同意明日交列表&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續要求控方在列表列出各人被指加入串謀的日期，以及其他後備的日期，又以楊雪盈為例，指加入串謀日期可能是港島區首次會議、6月8日分發協議最終版本、6月9日初選記者會、6月13日提名期開始、6月20日提名期結束、楊實際交表日期、6月30日《國安法》實施、7月1日、或7月11日和12日的初選投票日，望控方能說明。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰補充，法庭現時並非要就被告加入串謀的日期作裁斷，只是關注控方就「共謀者原則」證據的使用。周天行回應會嘗試，但指未必能列出被告加入的確實時間，問能否列明他們「最遲」加入的時間。陳指控方可另闢一欄處理，但亦要說明何時加入，直言「如果我們容許你提及最遲加入的時間，我肯定你只會說是2020年6月30日」。控方確認明天可提供此列表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方質疑公職人員失當與顛覆國家政權不同-不能作類比&quot;&gt;辯方質疑公職人員失當與顛覆國家政權不同 不能作類比&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表鄭達鴻和梁國雄的大律師黃宇逸其後陳詞。就控方稱各被告於《國安法》生效前涉違串謀公職人員行為失當，因此相關言行均可納為「共謀者原則」下的證據，黃宇逸指「公職人員行為失當罪」的控罪元素包括「故意」作出不當行為，但戴耀廷在《國安法》前稱認為初選是合法，因此並非「故意」違法。惟法官質疑，無證據顯示其他被告當時也相信戴耀廷說法，且不同被告對否決預算案的取態不一，辯方不能一概而論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過法官表示，理解辯方指「公職人員行為失當罪」與「顛覆國家政權罪」是不同的罪行、控罪元素不一，因此控方在運用證據時，不能以「公職人員行為失當罪」類比「顛覆國家政權罪」；而若辯方得悉控方指控被告公職人員行為失當，辯方抗辯和盤問會非常不同，黃宇逸同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方質疑被告未能預料國安法前言行變違法-引共謀者原則屬不公&quot;&gt;辯方質疑被告未能預料《國安法》前言行變違法 引「共謀者原則」屬不公&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃宇逸續解釋，一般而言任何傳聞證供（hearsay）均不能呈堂，惟在「共謀者原則」下例外；而引用「共謀者原則」的前提是被告同意追求一個「非法」目的，故所有促進該目的之言行均可用以指證所有共謀者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/V9Pgtwf.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
▲ 代表鄭達鴻和梁國雄的大律師 黃宇逸&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟黃認為，控方現時採納尚未變成「非法」的言行，是擴闊共謀者原則的用途，違背該原則的精神；又指被告《國安法》生效前未必能預料其言行或共同目的可能違法，控方以此指證被告，是剝奪他們基於刑事責任而選擇退出計劃的機會，有違首要的「公平性」原則。至於《國安法》後言行，黃認為只要符合相關前提，控方亦能接納為「共謀者原則」下的證據。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就控方提出的1950年美國案例 United States v. Dennis，黃指控方只是找到一份案例支持其說法，但該案例與共謀者原則無關，也沒說明應用共謀者原則的條件，對本案沒有約束力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方批無獨立證據證被告參與串謀&quot;&gt;辯方批無獨立證據證被告參與串謀&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 則表示，控方要援引「共謀者原則」，須有獨立證據證明何桂藍參與該串謀，惟現時無相關證據。李運騰指「墨落無悔」聲明書可佐證，惟 Beel 指控方已援引此為「共謀者原則」下的證據，故不屬「獨立證據」，但控方亦沒有其他證據，包括提名表格亦沒有明確顯示被告同意的「共識」是什麼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於控方指援引「共謀者原則」是為證明共謀者言行的「真實性（truth）」，代表李予信的大律師關文渭則指，控方並非意圖證明真實性，例如並非要指戴耀廷批評政府的說話為真。法官回應，控方目的是要藉相關文章顯示串謀的起源、性質和範圍，關文渭指即使沒有「共謀者原則」，相關證據也可呈堂，而控方真正目的是要指當一個人說某些話，是代表（acting as agent）所有其他被告說話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官重申美國案例無就共謀者原則作決定-惟控方堅稱有關&quot;&gt;官重申美國案例無就「共謀者原則」作決定 惟控方堅稱有關&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;主控萬德豪其後表示就辯方陳詞作簡短回應。就辯方對控方引1950年美國案例 United States v. Dennis 之質疑，該案涉有共產黨領袖於1945至1948年串謀暴力推翻美國政府，違反1940年通過的《史密斯法案》（The Smith Act）被定罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬重申該案例與共謀者原則有關，提及共謀者在控罪生效前的言行不能納為證據是不合理，又指本案的背景非常不同。陳慶偉表示那是常識（common sense），萬回應他會說更多關於常識的東西，惟陳即搖頭指不要說，並謂：「如果你只是想作簡短回應，便做一個簡短回應，然後你就可以坐下，我不是來聽學術辯論的，謝謝。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉並指，該案唯一受爭議的證據，是有關被告以外的共產黨教師，於《史密斯法案》（The Smith Act）在1940年通過前到訪莫斯科接受馬克斯主義的訓練，但那只是用以說明串謀起源的環境證供，不需用到共謀者原則，該案例亦沒有就該原則作出任何決定。惟萬德豪堅稱是有關共謀者原則的應用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官追問案例有否稱串謀於法例生效前形成-稱若然如此需小心交友&quot;&gt;官追問案例有否稱串謀於法例生效前形成 稱若然如此需小心交友&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問及，該案例有否裁定1940年前，該批教師已形成串謀協議推翻美國政府，並指「如果有，告訴我們第幾段」。萬德豪未有正面回應，僅稱判詞指該些教師與被告屬同一政黨，惟陳慶偉指那與串謀推翻政府是兩回事。李運騰亦指他們可能因有共同興趣而一同研習，但若案例指他們當時已形成協議，便要很小心選擇朋友，因若該些朋友日後成了罪犯，「即使以往的交往多清白，也可能會變成犯罪的言行。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪未有正面回答，李運騰再多次追問，又向萬指「我想你也很努力嘗試，我們欣賞你的努力，你還有沒有什麼想說？」，惟萬均沒有正面回應。陳慶偉指不認為案例有指明已形成協議，又着萬明天告訴法庭。李運騰最後再指，他的問題很簡單，只需答「是」或「否」，不是要猜謎，萬最後承認案例沒有如此提及。案件明早續審。&lt;/p&gt;

But what do Chinese experts have to say about the matter? And how might they be advising their government?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dynamics of Beijing’s relationship with Moscow remain as opaque as the inner workings of the Chinese Communist Party. As a result, we rely on body-language experts to dissect every aspect of a handshake between Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin to help confirm what we think we already know. Are China–Russia ties so plagued by mutual distrust that they are set for an inevitable weakening or even collapse? Or are they now so strong that they might develop into a formal alliance or lead China into providing military support to Moscow? Arguments continue to be made in both directions, some more convincing than others. Ultimately, however, we are mostly just reading the tea leaves, and this article will likewise attempt to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;security-as-chinas-main-driver&quot;&gt;Security as China’s Main Driver&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since having frank and open conversations with Chinese government officials is almost impossible, following academic debates has become one of the few ways of gleaning hints about how Chinese leaders may be reflecting upon certain issues and the type of advice that they may be receiving. Zhao Huasheng (赵华胜), one of China’s most renowned Russia experts, may provide a few clues. In one of the more comprehensive analyses of China–Russia relations to have been published in China since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Zhao explains why he believes that his country should maintain its close ties with Moscow in spite of the drawbacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, he describes security as being Beijing’s foremost interest in its bilateral relationship with the Kremlin. “With China’s greatest strategic pressure coming from the sea”, he says, “good Sino-Russian relations can ensure that China has … a relatively stable strategic rear … This has enormous strategic benefits for China. The significance of this is invisible and seemingly unremarkable in times of peace, but its strategic relevance to China will be revealed were our country to be faced with a major upheaval [变故] coming from abroad.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This goes beyond simply stabilising China’s 4,300-km-long border with Russia. On account of Moscow’s remaining influence in and around China’s neighbourhood, “good Sino-Russian relations can at the very least ensure the basic stability of half of Eurasia”, Zhao argues. Conversely, “a deterioration in Sino-Russian relations would plunge the entire Eurasian continent into a state of turmoil and uncertainty”. This would be highly detrimental to China’s “security and economic interests”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With its hinterland stabilised, Beijing is able to focus most of its energy and military resources on its coast, the surrounding seas and – most importantly – Taiwan. The island, according to Zhao, “is the greatest strategic challenge facing China. In a sense, it is like the sword of Damocles hanging over [our] head. We do not know when it will fall, perhaps suddenly, perhaps in the more distant future. But in any case, China cannot [afford] not to prepare itself for all the possible changes [that might affect] the situation in the Taiwan Strait. If the mainland were one day obliged to reunify using military means, we can be sure that China would then find itself in an extremely difficult and complex international environment”. And although Zhao does not expect Russia to be “completely” supportive of China (不期望俄罗斯完全支持中国) in the event of such a crisis – perhaps much like China’s stance over Ukraine – he does expect Moscow to maintain its ties with Beijing and to not take part in imposing sanctions on his country. Zhao reminds his readers that, “Among the major powers, Russia is probably the only one that is not opposed to China”. Were US-China relations ever to descend into outright confrontation (对峙), Moscow could well seek to play both sides. “But so long as it does not side with the US, this will be a strategic success for China”, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Perhaps more damaging to China than the war in Ukraine itself has been Beijing’s refusal to distance itself from the aggressor&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economically, Russia may only represent a small share (roughly 3%) of China’s foreign trade, Zhao says, but “in the event of a major international crisis, Russia would be the most important foreign source of energy – and [perhaps] even the only foreign source of oil – that China could conceivably continue to preserve”. Other scholars in China also highlight Russia’s important role in helping to achieve some of Beijing’s broader economic and financial objectives, such as the internationalisation of the yuan and the continued quest for a credible alternative to Western cross-border payment systems, with the aim of reducing China’s and the world’s dependence on the current US-dominated financial system. More broadly, Moscow is regularly portrayed as a key partner, if not Beijing’s most important partner, in what Zhao calls “China’s push to build a new international order” – in other words, an order that would be less dominated by the West and more in line with the interests of Moscow, Beijing and other members of the Global South. Losing the support of a permanent member of the UN Security Council and a key participant in such groupings as the BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation would inevitably jeopardise such plans. Summarising the China–Russia relationship, Wang Xiaoquan (王晓泉), a Russia specialist from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, remarks: “China and Russia are ‘half of the sky’ [半边天] for each other’s security and development”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-positive-and-negative-impact-of-the-war-in-ukraine-on-china&quot;&gt;The Positive and Negative Impact of the War in Ukraine on China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine came as a shock to most experts in China. Chinese academia has its fair share of Russia apologists who blame the war on both Washington and NATO’s eastward expansion. However, even they occasionally bemoan the adverse consequences that the war has had for China. To be sure, some see the conflict as having helped to push Russia further into China’s orbit and to accelerate the emergence of the desired new multipolar and less Western-centric world order, and even as having distracted – albeit temporarily – the US from its “containment” of China in the Indo-Pacific. Yet, in these scholarly discussions at least, the negatives seem to outweigh the positives. As Chinese economist Xu Mingqi (徐明棋) noted last year: “The repercussions of the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine have been largely negative [for us] and I cannot see China benefitting from it … First, it has hindered the world economy’s [post-pandemic] recovery; second, it has fuelled the ideological trend towards deglobalisation; and third, it has put global economic governance in jeopardy.” Stability abroad continues to be key to sustaining China’s economic development, Xu adds. In that respect at least, the war in Ukraine has evidently run counter to his country’s interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But perhaps more damaging to China than the war itself has been Beijing’s refusal to distance itself from the aggressor. A few months after the invasion, Yan Xuetong (阎学通), one of China’s leading international relations experts, acknowledged that “refusing to condemn Russia has strained China’s relations with some of its neighbours and distanced Beijing from many developing nations”. Like many others in China, Zhou Bo (周波), a well-known former senior People’s Liberation Army colonel turned think-tanker, regrets the negative impact that the war has had on China’s relations with Europe in particular. In his words: “The last thing China wants is a deterioration in its relations with European countries. It is very important to us that Europe is not always on the side of the United States.” Yang Jiemian (杨洁勉), another notable figure in China’s think-tank world (and brother of former top diplomat and politburo member Yang Jiechi), worries about the deep rift and growing hostility that has emerged between Russia and China on the one side and the West and its allies on the other (he blames this on Washington, of course). Like many of his peers, he is particularly concerned about the impact that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is having on cross-Strait relations, with the West more intent than ever on providing diplomatic and military support to Taiwan. Instability, decoupling, confrontation and containment are written all over these assessments, and Ukraine is depicted as a major catalyst of this trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-imperialistic-messianic-and-reckless-partner&quot;&gt;An Imperialistic, Messianic and Reckless Partner&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although censorship, self-censorship and China’s propaganda machine ensure that China–Russia relations are mostly portrayed as flourishing, disapproval of Russia’s actions does occasionally transpire even among China’s staunchest Russia sympathisers. Wang Wen (王文), for instance, who is the director of Renmin University’s Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies and a former Global Times journalist, recently asked Russian intellectual Aleksandr Dugin (who is also nicknamed “Putin’s brain” in China) “why Russia’s elite do not advise President Putin to do his best to avoid conflicts or to adopt approaches that might be better than [his] special military operations”. Also present in the writings and speeches of Chinese scholars are the occasional jabs at both Putin and Russia for their alleged imperialistic tendencies, messianic ideology and reckless behaviour. Feng Yujun (冯玉军), one of China’s most outspoken critics of Moscow since the beginning of the war and the director of Fudan University’s Centre for Russian and Central Asian Studies, stresses that “the imperial logic underlying both the rejection of Ukraine as a national entity and the overt claim to restore [Russia’s] traditional territories is alarming”. He describes Russian culture as suffering from a superiority complex and Putin’s conservatism as an empty “discursive bubble”, a mere tool for Moscow to advance its political interests and bolster its legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historical grievances against Russia run deep in China and regularly resurface even among ordinary citizens. As Yuan Gang (袁刚), then a professor at Peking University, once noted: “In recent times, China has had its share of invasions and abuse at the hands of the Great Powers, yet Russia’s seizure of Chinese territories was the greatest scourge of all.” Memories of betrayals, bullying and even aggression by China’s former Soviet brother are surely still very much alive, particularly among President Xi’s generation, which lived through some of the tensest moments of China–USSR relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Chinese scholars do not hesitate to point out that Russia’s vision of a new world order differs greatly from China’s&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese Ambassador to France Lu Shaye’s (卢沙野) recent comments, which appeared to question the legal status of former Soviet states, should not distract from the palpable unease among Chinese intellectuals over Russia’s approach to national sovereignty – a concept that continues to be paramount for China. Shortly after Moscow’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, Yuan asked ironically: “Could China’s Tannu Uriankhai consisting of 170,000 square kilometres of territory, which was seized by the Soviet Union under Lenin and [later] replaced by the so-called “Tuvan Autonomous Republic”, be returned to China by a vote of the local inhabitants, who have long been inclined towards separatism, with the promise of a tripling of their pay by China? Even worse, if a majority of the Taiwanese were to vote in favour of independence, would China resign itself to this fate?” He continued: “The Russians have also openly introduced the concept of ‘strategic space’, going so far as to treat the territories of other countries as their own ‘space’ and claiming that they cannot stand the West ‘encroaching’ on their ‘strategic space’. What is the difference between this and Hitler’s cry for ‘Lebensraum’?” Yuan is admittedly on the extreme end of the spectrum when it comes to criticising Russia (and his own government), but milder versions of his views continue to exist in China. Whether President Xi and his colleagues are closer to Ambassador Lu’s perception of former Soviet states or to Yuan’s is difficult to tell. But their official rebuttal of Lu’s controversial comments and their refusal to recognise Russia’s annexations in eastern Ukraine (including Crimea) show at the very least that Russian behaviour poses a challenge to one of China’s most fundamental principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all the vaunted camaraderie between Xi and Putin and the former’s recent parting words to his “dear friend” that the world is undergoing its biggest change in a century and that “we are driving this change together”, Chinese scholars do not hesitate to point out that Russia’s vision of a new world order differs greatly from China’s. Zhao Long (赵隆), a researcher at one of China’s top think tanks (SIIS), notes that “while China emphasises the careful reform and improvement of the [current] order, Russia hopes for its complete disintegration”. Huang Jing (黄靖), a well-known “returnee scholar” from the US, says much the same, adding that Moscow’s desire to confront and weaken the West does not align with China’s developmental interests. Feng adds that if Putin does indeed seek to overturn the current order, then he should at least have a credible alternative to offer, but he does not. While most Chinese scholars may not go as far as Feng in his criticism of Russian mentality, politics and society in general, many point to the increasingly visible weaknesses in Russia’s economy, military and technological advancement. Tang Shiping (唐世平), another prominent international relations scholar from Fudan University, describes how Russia’s overall strength and influence have been severely damaged by the war and concludes (in English) that, “Although Russia remains an important strategic partner of China, the China-Russia strategic partnership surely faces growing challenges”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overt calls by Chinese scholars for Beijing to distance itself from Moscow are rare for obvious reasons. Somewhat more common are implicit and explicit criticisms of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, though Chinese censors have prevented at least some of these voices from being heard. While – as Feng points out – mentions of China’s “no limits” partnership with Russia have indeed faded from Chinese official pronouncements, relations with Moscow are still going strong 15 months into the war, and China–Russia joint military exercises continue apace. Challenges to the relationship there may be, but few predict a sudden and significant repositioning of Beijing’s approach to Russia, barring a major upset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinarussia-relations-through-the-lens-of-a-chinese-realist&quot;&gt;China–Russia Relations Through the Lens of a Chinese Realist&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given Beijing’s recent posture towards both Russia and Ukraine, Zhao’s analysis of China–Russia relations in the context of this conflict remains one of the most compelling. He acknowledges that his government’s refusal to condemn Moscow for its actions has tarnished China’s image, particularly in the West. But he sees the benefits of maintaining close ties with Moscow as outweighing those that Beijing might gain by condemning (and offending) Russia. Zhao is a self-professed proponent of realpolitik and a critic of values-driven diplomacy. Like many of his peers, he probably does disapprove of Russia’s actions, but does not say so explicitly, simply noting that “maintaining Sino-Russian cooperation does not imply supporting all of Russia’s actions and policies”. He claims to be neither pro-US nor anti-US, and neither pro-Russia nor anti-Russia. Rather, he is guided first and foremost by his country’s national interests. “Russia is not infringing China’s core interests, so why should [we] take the initiative to destroy a friendly relationship?”, he asks. “There is a saying that nothing is more difficult to build up and easier to destroy than trust. The friendship between China and Russia has been extremely difficult to achieve. Destroying it would be much easier. All it would take is a condemnatory statement [by China] and participation in sanctions against Russia and the foundation of friendship and trust that China and Russia have built up over decades would collapse.” Like Zhao, many – if not most – Chinese experts do not believe that joining the West in condemning Russia would have led Washington to soften its approach to China. Siding more closely with the West and Ukraine would, as the Chinese expression goes, have been akin to “giving a bride away on top of losing one’s soldiers” (赔了夫人又折兵).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if one were boldly to assume that China’s leadership is assessing its relationship with the Kremlin through a similar lens to that of Zhao and other like-minded Chinese realists, then Beijing’s neutrality in this conflict would seem all the more difficult to sustain. If moral values must give way to a country’s strategic interests, then China would need Russia to come out on top or – at the very least – not to lose too badly in Ukraine. This is essentially what Tang was suggesting in a piece last year. Yang Jiemian would probably agree: “In the unlikely event that Russia were to be continually weakened to the extent that it would be unable, unwilling or afraid to continue its struggle against the US and the West”, he writes, “this would ultimately lead to an extremely unfavourable strategic situation for China”. Feng Shaolei (冯绍雷), another prominent Russia specialist, worries about what would happen if either a pro-Western regime or an even more radical force than Putin’s were to take over the Kremlin and become China’s neighbour. Feng has thus called on his government to take a more “proactive” stance in trying to resolve this conflict and to use the influence that it has to encourage peace talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Being dragged further into the Ukraine quagmire is the last thing that China wants, and safeguarding its already tense relations with the West remains one of its top priorities&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question of whether China might ever provide military support to Moscow (it has denied that it will) is a particularly thorny one that would necessitate more careful consideration than a short analysis of Chinese scholarly views. However, to continue using Zhao’s realist lens, it would seem logical for Beijing to want to prevent both an unknown neighbour from suddenly appearing on its doorstep and the Kremlin from being so weakened that it leaves a power vacuum in China’s fragile Central Asian neighbourhood. Needless to say, China brazenly shipping military goods directly to Russia is hard to imagine and would not be in keeping with its peace-promoting, non-aligned and non-interfering posture. But there are, of course, other ways of keeping a friend afloat. What is also abundantly clear from these discussions is that being dragged further into this quagmire is the last thing that China wants, and safeguarding its already tense relations with the West remains one of its top priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, a UK civil servant specialising in China–Russia relations wrote a piece under a pseudonym in which he/she warned that China–Russia ties were likely to strengthen and that they might even develop “into some form of formal alliance structure as each looks to the other for support against perceived Western encirclement”. The argument that what the Chinese would call “contradictions” with the West – and more specifically with the US – are the main binding force and driver of China–Russia relations is certainly a very strong (and widely held) one. But in the light of what Chinese experts have been advocating, the author’s suggestion that Beijing’s partnership with Moscow might develop into a formal alliance appears somewhat less convincing. The author apparently bases part of his/her argument on two Chinese sources recommending this change, the first being Yan Xuetong and the other “a government-commissioned national security ‘blue book’” written by CICIR, a key think tank linked to China’s Ministry of State Security. Unfortunately, no valid link to this report was provided, but since pro-alliance views have previously been expressed in China, one must assume that this was indeed part of its recommendations. That being said, one report published almost 10 years ago is insufficient to substantiate the idea that Chinese experts are currently pushing for this change. In fact, the director of CICIR’s Institute of Eurasian Studies, Ding Xiaoxing (丁晓星), published a paper just last month in which he maintains that “forging a partnership without forming an alliance [结伴不结盟] is more conducive to the long-term development of Sino-Russian relations”. As for Yan, most China watchers will know that he has long been arguing for his country to form alliances with some of its neighbours but, as he has stated himself, his proposal has been rebuffed not only by most of his colleagues, but also by his government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although a more comprehensive overview of both Chinese and Russian opinions on this topic would be welcome, none of the papers reviewed for this article signalled that the tide might be turning in favour of implementing such a change. Quite the contrary. Ding, Zhao and others believe that a formal alliance would create unnecessary risks for a relationship that remains both inherently fragile and scarred by the failures of the previous Sino-Soviet alliance. But were a new alliance ever to be formed, writes Ding, “the possibility of another breakdown in relations between the two countries cannot be ruled out if inequalities in the relationship were to reappear”. Indeed, Chinese scholars are deeply aware of the impact that the dramatic shift in their country’s relative power is having on such a proud country as Russia. Moreover, an alliance would risk exacerbating the bipolarisation of world politics, dragging the Chinese into conflicts that are not theirs to fight and negating Beijing’s vaunted principle of non-alignment. Beijing is better off with a vaguer and more malleable cooperative framework, they say. “Unless Washington increases its strategic pressure on Beijing and Moscow to such an extreme that both states feel compelled to consolidate a formal alliance, China and Russia will continue to pursue a hedging strategy but avoid entering an outright alliance”, concludes Wang Dong (王栋), a professor at Peking University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has been a defining moment in China–Russia relations, and Beijing has shown that it is willing to put up with relatively high costs in order to preserve its ties with the Kremlin. Beijing says that its relationship with Moscow has a “bottom line”, but how far Putin could still go before breaching it is rarely addressed in China. So far, few Chinese scholars have hinted at a significant shift in Beijing’s current policy towards Moscow. The war has certainly presented the China–Russia relationship with “challenges” that are yet to be addressed, but Russia appears to be too strategically important for China to risk losing it right now. A toppling of Putin by a pro-Western force or a crippling of the Kremlin would in all likelihood be a disaster for Beijing. Nevertheless, suspicion of and – for some – even deep-seated antipathy towards this important partner is also evident in these discussions. That is one reason why so many Chinese experts continue to argue against forging a formal alliance with Russia. Distrust (on both sides) points once again to the underlying fragility of China–Russia ties and is perhaps one of the reasons why Beijing has been quite so afraid of offending its partner.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;控方首稱被告《國安法》生效前涉公職人員行為失當 官質疑不公&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（29日）踏入審訊第59天，處理「共謀者原則」的法律爭議，包括該原則是否適用於《國安法》生效前的言行。控方表示，區諾軒和戴耀廷於2020年1月的飯局已達成串謀協議，有無差別否決預算案迫使政府回應五大訴求的不合法「共同目的」，而被告當時同意濫用立法會議員職權，或涉串謀公職人員行為失當，認為共謀者於《國安法》生效前的言行，可用來指證被告干犯本案控罪。惟法官質疑，飯局上並沒有達成任何協議，區諾軒亦稱與戴耀廷目的不同；又指控方已處理本案兩年半，但開審50多天才首稱被告《國安法》生效前或早已違法，質疑對被告造成不公。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方亦援引一宗1950年的美國上訴法院案例，指控罪生效前的言行可納為「共謀者原則」下的證據，但同意是控方能找到的唯一案例，遭法官質疑案例不適用於本案。辯方陳詞時則批評，控方於法律爭議階段才突提及公職人員行為失當的指控是「不公平至極」，又強調《國安法》生效前討論無差別否決預算案並不構成任何罪行，故共謀者原則不可能適用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方區諾軒戴耀廷2020年1月已有無差別否決財案共同目的&quot;&gt;控方：區諾軒戴耀廷2020年1月已有無差別否決財案「共同目的」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方早前傳畢所有證人，案件押至今就「共謀者原則（co-conspirators rule）」等法律爭議陳詞。根據該原則，各共謀者的言行均可用來指證所有被告，而控方早前指並非本案被告的蔡澤鴻、黎敬輝和郭榮鏗均是本案共謀者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉甫開庭表示，關注《國安法》生效前共謀者的言行可否被納為共謀者原則下的證據，望先聽取這方面的陳詞。主控周天行表示，辯方就共謀者原則提交聯合書面陳詞，惟鄭達鴻、梁國雄和柯耀林沒有參與，另外提交陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行先表明，控方立場並非指《國安法》具追溯力，只是認為共謀者在《國安法》生效前的言行均可用來指證各被告。周續引案例，指援引此原則的重點是在串謀的「共同目的（common purpose）」，而非所控的「罪行」；而控方認為本案串謀協議由區諾軒與戴耀廷於2020年1月底的飯局達成，他們同意無差別否決預算案，以迫使政府回應五大訴求，而此「共同目的」由始至終維持不變。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官質疑飯局無達成協議區諾軒稱與戴耀廷目的不一-控方或出錯&quot;&gt;官質疑飯局無達成協議、區諾軒稱與戴耀廷目的不一 控方或出錯&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周續指，共謀者於《國安法》生效前的言行均一直促進（in furtherance）和建立（build up）本案的串謀，例如招募潛在的共謀者、提倡和宣傳串謀等，並逐步擴大規模；並指即使《國安法》未生效，各被告的串謀協議亦是違法，可能干犯串謀公職人員行為失當，故當時的言行均可納為「共謀者原則」下的證據，用來指證被告串謀顛覆國家政權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉指，控方在開案陳詞沒有如此說明，這是他第一次聽到此說法。李運騰亦指，在50多天的審訊中控方從無提及此立場。周天行同意，並強調被告的共同目的維持不變。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟陳慶偉指「我個人有懷疑」，指在一開始的飯局「沒有同意任何事，甚至沒有同意舉辦公民投票（“Nothing has been agreed, not even the holding of a civil voting.”）」，而區諾軒的證供是「戴耀廷可能有他的目的，但我有不同的目的」。周天行欲解釋，遭陳打斷指明白控方立場，但「我是指出你可能有問題，因為你說早在1月的飯局已達成共同目的，我是說你可能有錯（mistaken）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方引1950年美國案例-指控罪生效前言行可納為證據-同意僅唯一案例&quot;&gt;控方引1950年美國案例 指控罪生效前言行可納為證據 同意僅唯一案例&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方同意，若法庭不接納就共同目的之陳詞，將會依賴一宗美國聯邦第二巡迴上訴法院於1950年的案例United States v. Dennis，以說明控罪生效前的言行，仍可納為共謀者原則下的證據。李運騰問，故在所有的普通法管轄區，控方只是找到一宗案例支持他們的說法，而且該案例還是來自美國的上訴法院？周天行同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據該案例，有共產黨領袖被控於1945至1948年串謀暴力推翻美國政府，違反1940年通過的《史密斯法案》（The Smith Act）。周引案例指，沒有合理原因將串謀的證據限於控罪期間，因若串謀於控罪日期前發生，相關共謀者的言行亦同樣有力；又指其他共謀者促進串謀的言行可被視作被告的言行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟陳慶偉指出，案例亦表明只適用於控罪期間發生的言行；辯方亦反駁根據該案例，共謀者言行只是用來指證作出相關言行的本人，而非其他人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問50年前無罪言論是否可用作指證被告-稱一輩子都要很小心&quot;&gt;官問50年前無罪言論是否可用作指證被告 稱「一輩子都要很小心」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續舉例，若3名主審法官稱要推翻政府，而提出的當刻並不犯法，控方是否認為50年後，可用他50年前的言論指證他們3人？周天行僅重申，控方立場是由於共謀者一直懷有共同目的，故用以建立串謀的言行均可用來推論串謀的範圍性質及被告的參與。陳笑言，「那即是說我們這輩子都要很小心了」，因一旦他將內心想法說出口，說過的話餘生也可用來指證他，林卓廷大笑。控方回應是視乎串謀是否持續。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方確認，現時批評政府的言行日後可用作檢控。陳慶偉續指他不明白，指《國安法》生效前並沒有「顛覆國家政權罪」，那又怎麼可能有「串謀」？控方又怎能利用被告的意念和協議來控告之後的行為？陳仲衡指，因此控方要援引公職人員行為失當罪，以證被告於《國安法》生效前的協議已違法，周天行同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官質疑控方開審50多天才首提國安法生效前已違法-對被告不公&quot;&gt;官質疑控方開審50多天才首提《國安法》生效前已違法 對被告不公&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指，這是控方首次提出被告的行為在《國安法》生效前已可能違反普通法下的罪行，指他在開審首天已提出對該原則的關注，「為何我們要到了開審50多天，才知道你有這個後備立場（fallback position）？」，質疑對被告構成不公。陳慶偉亦質疑周天行已處理本案兩年半。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方澄清，無意控告被告公職人員行為失當，只是為了顯示被告自2020年1月起已懷有違法的共同目的，以爭論共謀者原則適用於本案；又指此前沒機會提出，但法官反問：「何謂沒機會？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官指被告言行可推論串謀範圍-控方稱引共謀者原則為證涉案言行真實性&quot;&gt;官指被告言行可推論串謀範圍 控方稱引共謀者原則為證涉案言行真實性&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續提出，《國安法》生效前的言行，如戴耀廷的文章，可作為背景或環境證供推論被告的犯案意圖和思想狀態，並不需要依賴共謀者原則才可呈堂；陳慶偉亦指區諾軒作供時已供述串謀的目的。控方同意，但指援引共謀者原則是要證明共謀者言行所指的「真實性（truth）」，顯示被告的參與。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;主控萬德豪續指，該美國案例提及可考慮與被告屬同一黨派的其他共謀者言行。惟李運騰質疑，該案例只是將相關言行視為被告犯案的背景和環境證供，而非用以證明他們陳述的真實性，與本案的共謀者原則無關，亦不適用於本案；又指若控方只是以相關言行推論串謀範圍，他可以接受，但若控方是以此證明其案情，如接納戴耀廷說已將所有文件發給參與者、或戴耀廷向趙家賢確認新東第二次會議曾進行投票的說法為真實，「那情況就非常不同了，不是嗎？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方同意，並承認所援引的案例只是法官向陪審團表達的「附帶意見（obiter）」，承認「這是我們唯一能找到的（“I have to admit that is all we can find.”）」，但重申該案例與共謀者原則有關。陳慶偉其後指，並非指控方不能依賴戴耀廷的說話，只是不能將戴所說視為事情的全部真相並用以指證所有被告，指那涉及另一個問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官屢追問為何無於開案提公職人員行為失當-控方指控罪已提及&quot;&gt;官屢追問為何無於開案提公職人員行為失當 控方指控罪已提及&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就法官對控方從未提及公職人員行為失當罪的質疑，萬德豪回應，控方的確從沒有在開案陳詞提及該控罪，但認為開案陳詞目的只是向法庭講述控方會援引的證據。李運騰指開案陳詞不止是複述證供（recital of evidence），還要讓法庭和辯方得知控方對案件的主張（case theory），直言這是很重要的部分。陳慶偉亦指，控方無可避免應列出公職人員行為失當罪的詳情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪重申之所以沒有事先說明，是因控方並非控告被告於《國安法》生效前干犯公職人員行為失當，只是望以此說明共謀者原則適用於本案，不希望就此技術問題令法庭混淆；又指知道控方案情完結前有機會向法庭說明。惟陳慶偉搖頭謂：「我對這個論點不滿意，謝謝。（“I am not impressed with this line of argument, thank you.”）」萬德豪強調，並非要以此「突襲（ambush）」任何人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指，控方控罪提及被告以非法手段犯案，追問有什麼阻礙控方於案件開初便說明指控被告干犯公職人員行為失當？萬指經再考慮（on second thought）下，或許在起初說明是較合適；並指控罪有關非法手段的第四細項也提及被告「承諾或同意在該選舉中當選後，及／或煽動、促使、引致、誘使他人在該選舉中當選後，故意或蓄意不履行，或故意或蓄意疏於履行其立法會議員職責」，指該指控實質上也與公職人員行為失當罪一致。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰總結指，控方立場是雖然開案陳詞沒有表明，但某程度上在控罪上已有此暗示；但質疑其說法不一致，因萬德豪兩分鐘前才承認是第一次提及，現在又說控罪一早已提及。陳慶偉亦搖頭重申，控方可在開案陳詞說明，並指已聽夠相關論點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官質疑控方立場或影響辯方盤問主問從無提濫權&quot;&gt;官質疑控方立場或影響辯方盤問、主問從無提「濫權」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續提及下一點是關於「公平」，陳慶偉問：「對控方的公平？」庭內傳出笑聲，萬指是有關審訊的公平，因望回應辯方引案例談及案件的公平性。李運騰問，若控方一早表明欲指控被告干犯公職人員行為失當，會影響辯方盤問控方證人嗎？萬指不認為會，惟李指這不是控方說了算。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李並指，現時辯方盤問主要集中在達致35+的可能、被告是否有權否決預算案、以及被告是否盡責和細心的議員等，但沒問及他們的協議是否會濫用立會議員的職權，即公職人員行為失當罪的基礎；陳慶偉亦指，控方沒有傳召證人葉劉淑儀，但若控方有相關指控，相信辯方如 Trevor Beel 可能會有不一樣的盤問。庭上早前透露，葉劉淑儀的證供與解散立法會程序及議員職責相關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪僅回應，本案重點是無差別否決預算案，即被告是否有共同決心以否決預算案作武器，迫使政府回應訴求，又指那是「明顯的濫權（abuse of power）」。李運騰即指，在主問過程，控方從沒提及「濫用」，萬同意，但認為可從證據推論，不認為控方證人需就被告是否濫權給出意見、相關意見亦與案不太相關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續笑着翻動手中開案陳詞，並一手拿起，指「這是我所處理過最厚的開案陳詞，但沒有一隻字提及公職人員行為失當」。萬同意，但重申控罪詳情已足以讓辯方知道控方的指控。控方其後表示陳詞完畢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方批控方突指控公職人員行為失當不公平至極國安法前討論否決財案非刑事&quot;&gt;辯方批控方突指控公職人員行為失當「不公平至極」、《國安法》前討論否決財案非刑事&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表黃碧雲及林卓廷的大律師沈士文其後就辯方的聯合陳詞發言，表示本案唯一的控罪就是《國安法》，而《國安法》生效前的言行是合法，並不構成任何罪行。李運騰指，但控方立場是一直指控被告公職人員行為失當。惟沈士文指那完全與案無關，並指若控方一早表明被告可能干犯此罪，辯方便會循此方向抗辯；惟控方在爭議共謀者原則時，才突然作此指控，「我看不到比這更不公平的事」、批評是「不公平至極」，指控方竟「夠膽」談及公平。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 黃碧雲（左）、李予信（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就控方指被告的共同目的維持不變，沈士文反駁指「公職人員行為失當罪」和「顛覆國家政權罪」的法律條文完全不同，亦同意法官陳慶偉指，認罪被告的案情摘要也沒有公職人員行為失當的指控。沈並指，控方曾有很多機會說明立場，包括開案陳詞、及呈交共謀者原則的證據列表時，但控方也完全沒提及相關指控。李運騰補充「濫權」一說更是今天口頭陳詞才首次提及。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文續指，共謀者原則適用的前提，還包括相關共謀者言行必須是促進串謀協議（in furtherance of the conspiracy），以及於串謀待實現期間發生（during the pendency of the conspiracy）；惟沈強調，《國安法》生效前，一起討論無差別否決預算案並非「刑事串謀」，故上述條件也不可能成立。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件押至周三（31日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent disclosure of Russian naval activity in the vicinity of key maritime infrastructure in the North Sea including cables, windfarms and pipelines should not necessarily come as a surprise. Russia has spent a considerable amount of effort investing in capabilities that would allow it to pose a threat to European critical infrastructure, and has viewed this as an imperative since the Soviet era. An emphasis on demonstrating the ability to target economically vital assets can be found in Russian thinking on escalation management, which presumes – correctly or otherwise – that the ability to inflict economic harm represents a means of containing local conflicts on Russia’s periphery by deterring external intervention. In a conflict with NATO, damage to infrastructure at sea along with the targeting of infrastructure ashore would be a key part of Russia’s overall war effort, aimed at gradually eroding popular support in the West. This article will examine some of the tools at Russia’s disposal for the prosecution of a campaign against European infrastructure at sea, the organisational structures that manage them, and the ways in which the threats they pose can be mitigated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russian-seabed-warfare-an-intelligence-function-not-a-naval-one&quot;&gt;Russian Seabed Warfare: An Intelligence Function, not a Naval One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The task of maritime special operations is spread across different organisations within the Russian system, including the Russian Navy and the Main Directorate for Deep Sea Research (GUGI). These organisations field somewhat different capabilities and likely own different aspects of the function of maritime sabotage. Notably, however, although the Russian Navy plays a key operational role, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and the GRU – Russia’s foreign military intelligence agency – appear to control activity in organisational terms, both through the GUGI and the Russian Naval Staff’s Intelligence Directorate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GUGI represents a particularly interesting and specialised body. Founded within the navy in 1965 and given its present organisational status in 1975, the organisation exists independent of naval command and has the status of a directorate within the Russian MoD. While independent of the navy, it draws personnel from the 29th Separate Submarine division, a formation based at Olenya Guba which exists to operate platforms for the GUGI. The body operates a number of specialised submarines including the Paltus, X-Ray, Kashalot and Losharik (which is currently undergoing repairs). These submarines share the characteristic of being titanium-hulled, enabling them to sustain the pressure of operating at extreme depths. In the case of the Losharik, the submarine also has a unique internal arrangement, with its hull comprised of seven joined spherical chambers which distribute pressure, enabling it to operate at depths of up to 2,500 metres. The submarines have typically been equipped with manipulator arms, and in the case of the X-Ray, a diver lock-out. Though nuclear-powered, these submarines are relatively small, making the sustainment of crews for extended periods difficult – something experienced by the US Navy with analogous vessels such as the NR-1. As such, they need to be supported by motherships on longer voyages. For this role, the Soviets and then the Russians have typically used stretched versions of retired nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) such as the Yankee class and nuclear-powered cruise missile submarines (SSGNs) such as the Oscar class. The GUGI’s two current motherships, the Belgorod and the BS-64 Podmoskovye, are respectively a stretched Oscar-class SSGN and a Delta-class SSBN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the GUGI operates surface vessels that nominally act as research vessels to gather intelligence. These include the Yantar, which received attention for activity around sensitive cables near the UK in 2019. The vessel is equipped with a variety of sensors and appears capable of acting as a host vessel for the Pr18610 – a three-man deep-diving submersible capable of operating at depths of 20,000 feet. In addition, the vessel likely hosts a range of remotely operated and autonomous underwater vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While understandable attention has been paid to the GUGI’s likely role in damaging critical infrastructure in the event of an escalating conflict, it is important not to assume that this is its only function. The organisation is tasked with the emplacement of sensors associated with Russia’s Harmony network, surveillance of foreign assets in Russian waters, and the removal of foreign surveillance assets, including taps on wires. In addition, the Belgorod will apparently host a part of the Russian nuclear arsenal in the form of the Poseidon nuclear torpedo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In a conflict with NATO, damage to infrastructure at sea would be a key part of Russia’s overall war effort, aimed at gradually eroding popular support in the West&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time that naval personnel spend within the GUGI sees them paid considerable salaries without breaking the relationship between rank and pay, by treating their effective salaries as a deployment bonus related to the time they spend at extreme depths. As a result, in 2012, GUGI personnel were earning 600,000 roubles a month (around $20,000 at the time). The reason for this level of compensation is that the organisation is an extremely specialised one. During the Soviet era, in order to qualify, an individual had to be an officer and have served for five years within the submarine service, and would then have to go through a gruelling course based on the training of Soviet cosmonauts. The list of individuals killed in the 2019 fire which broke out on the GUGI deep-diving submarine Losharik – all officers – suggests the force remains a highly specialised one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GUGI does not own the entirety of the task of maritime sabotage, however. A key role is also played by the Intelligence Directorate of the Main Staff of the Russian Navy. Since 1977, the director of Russian Naval Intelligence has also typically been the deputy director of the GRU, and the Intelligence Directorate was made subordinate to the fifth directorate of the GRU, which reflected the subordination of naval intelligence to the latter – a process which accelerated under the tenure of Admiral Vladimir Chernavin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, the Russian vessel most recently spotted near European infrastructure – the Akademik Vladimirsky – belongs to the Russian Navy and not to the GUGI. Though the precise suite of sensors on board the ship are unknown, in a 2012 research expedition to the South Pole it deployed a proton magnetometer, which could also be used to discover metallic objects on the seabed such as pipelines. During the Cold War, the Soviet Navy also maintained a number of auxiliary surveillance vessels based on common trawlers, which were tasked with a range of intelligence gathering functions, and regional fleets controlled Spetsnaz units with an explicit sabotage role. Moreover, the Navy was charged with managing relations with Soviet fishing fleets, which could be co-opted into both intelligence gathering and sabotage functions. The recently revealed use of civilian vessels to survey wind farms in the North Sea suggests that this practice has been continued and is likely a task of the Navy rather than the GUGI. The Spetsnaz units controlled by regional fleets can be inserted into theatre using a range of mechanisms such as swimmer delivery vehicles, and can be used for both surveillance and covert operations against military and civilian targets. The Northern Fleet’s Spetsnaz have trained for operations against SOSUS, and those of the Baltic Fleet have allegedly been involved in covert sabotage. Like all Spetsnaz, these units are under the ultimate control of the GRU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bifurcation of responsibilities between naval intelligence, which answers to the GRU, and the GUGI – which apparently sits as a directorate within the Russian MoD – would seem to create an artificial divide between assets performing similar functions. There is nothing entirely unusual about an intelligence agency controlling assets that are especially sensitive; the CIA, for example, directly controlled the U-2 spy plane and directed many of the operations of spy submarines like the NR-1. However, leaving some assets with the Russian Navy (albeit under ultimate control of the GRU) while conferring others on the GUGI is an interesting organisational choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One possibility is that sensitivity is the primary consideration, although given the likely involvement of the GRU in highly sensitive unconventional operations including both sabotage and assassinations, this seems unlikely to be the case. Another possibility is that because the fifth directorate is responsible for operational intelligence, its responsibilities include more strictly military tasks such as trailing Western naval assets, whereas the GUGI retains control over those assets needed for activities that are more strategic. A final reason why these assets were removed from the navy’s control may have been the reassertion of control by the Russian General Staff over the Soviet Navy under the tenure of Marshal Nikolai Ogarkov and then-Soviet Defence Minister Dmitri Ustinov.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Navies will likely need to have the organisational structures to coordinate with a broader range of actors in order to meet the challenge of maritime sabotage&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, the GUGI appears capable of organising its assets along with naval capabilities on a task-specific basis. For example, one investigation of the Nord Stream blasts alleged that elements of both Unit 45707 and the 313th Special-Purpose Detachment for Combating Underwater Sabotage of the Baltic Fleet were involved. As such, it would appear that the GUGI can draw on assets from the wider fleet as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;challenges-to-critical-national-infrastructure&quot;&gt;Challenges to Critical National Infrastructure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The different components of Russia’s overall maritime sabotage capability pose different challenges to the critical infrastructure of European countries, which encompasses undersea cables, gas pipelines and windfarms, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deep-diving submarines can sever cables at depths which make repairs extremely difficult. They can also tap sensitive undersea cables. However, these capabilities are limited in number and operated by only a few very specialised individuals. The GUGI, moreover, has a number of additional operational obligations, such as maintaining Russia’s undersea sensor networks and conducting surveillance near its maritime bastions. Additionally, the motherships on which deep-diving submarines depend for longer transits, such as the Belgorod, are likely to be detectable by NATO anti-submarine warfare assets to roughly the same degree as the submarines on which they are based were. A more pressing challenge than detecting capabilities is establishing rules of engagement, particularly in peacetime. In territorial waters, countries can prosecute foreign submarines they detect aggressively – something the Soviets frequently did with US submarines during the Cold War, and vice versa. In international waters, however, this is likely to be more of a challenge. That said, Western navies can complicate the activity of Russian special purpose submarines in other ways. For example, activity at or near the sensor networks for which the GUGI is responsible can force it to allocate scarce resources to more defensive functions. Alternatively, civil-military partnerships can be used to remove deniability. To use an example, the Italian Navy recently struck an agreement with the country’s largest internet provider to share data. Many private-sector actors operate sensors, including unmanned underwater vehicles and pressure detectors, to monitor damage. If claims made by a navy regarding the activity of a submarine in the vicinity of undersea cables can be verified through a private partner, this could raise the risk of attribution and set the conditions for other policy instruments such as sanctions to be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge posed by a combination of auxiliaries and surface vessels operated by the Russian Navy is a somewhat different one. These vessels cannot necessarily damage infrastructure such as undersea cables at depths that would make repairs especially difficult, but by virtue of being inconspicuous they are harder to track and identify. As the ambiguity around the Nord Stream blasts illustrates, this can pose a substantial challenge for attribution. That being said, there are also methods of interdiction against surface vessels that do not exist for subsurface assets. The 1884 Cable Convention, to which Russia is a signatory, allows navies to board and search ships in international waters if they believe them to be tampering with undersea cables – a right the US has exercised. Similarly, the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) allows countries to constrain the activities of civilian vessels conducting surveillance relevant to economic exploitation within their exclusive economic zones (EEZs) – and most of these activities overlap substantially with the sort of surveillance a ship would need to do to survey infrastructure. In the Baltic and North Seas, which are almost entirely straddled by Western EEZs, this could be a basis for significantly limiting the freedom of action of Russian auxiliary ships while remaining within international law. To be sure, UNCLOS allows military vessels the right of surveillance within EEZs, but such vessels are readily identifiable in both peacetime and conflict, enabling attribution in peacetime and interdiction above the threshold of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge with regards to auxiliary ships is primarily one of classification. This challenge is in some ways not dissimilar to constabulary activities such as counter-smuggling or counterpiracy: it requires a suspect vessel to be identified in the midst of a large number of ships conducting normal economic activity. A number of measures could make this more robust. For example, we might consider recent work on the use of machine learning as well as more traditional algorithmic tools to identify irregular patterns of activity by a vessel. That said, to build the body of data needed to support these processes, Western navies will need presence in key theatres and greater levels of situational awareness than naval assets alone can provide. As the efforts of CTF-151 in the context of counterpiracy have illustrated, the sheer number of vessels needed for this level of presence means such efforts must necessarily be multinational. Given that NATO’s standing maritime groups typically do not control the assets needed for these functions in peacetime (though this may be changing), such functions could be achieved on a regional basis through framework nation constructs. In addition, the tasks of both surveillance and attribution would likely be made considerably easier if assets from across and beyond militaries could be used to both achieve domain awareness and attribute malign activity. Recent efforts by countries such as Italy to build relationships between its navy and the private sector stand out as examples. Similarly, the decision by France to make seabed security a national strategic concern coordinated across government may represent a step towards achieving this imperative. While naval assets will remain crucial for tasks from surveillance to interdiction, navies will likely need to have the organisational structures to coordinate with a broader range of actors in order to meet the challenge of maritime sabotage.&lt;/p&gt;

The report examines Russian military adaptation by combat function.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian infantry tactics have shifted from trying to deploy uniform Battalion Tactical Groups as combined arms units of action to a stratified division by function into line, assault, specialised and disposable troops. These are formed into task-organised groupings. Line infantry are largely used for ground holding and defensive operations. Disposable infantry are used for continuous skirmishing to either identify Ukrainian firing positions, which are then targeted by specialised infantry, or to find weak points in Ukrainian defences to be prioritised for assault. Casualties are very unevenly distributed across these functions. The foremost weakness across Russian infantry units is low morale, which leads to poor unit cohesion and inter-unit cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian engineering has proven to be one of the stronger branches of the Russian military. Russian engineers have been constructing complex obstacles and field fortifications across the front. This includes concrete reinforced trenches and command bunkers, wire-entanglements, hedgehogs, anti-tank ditches, and complex minefields. Russian mine laying is extensive and mixes anti-tank and victim-initiated anti-personnel mines, the latter frequently being laid with multiple initiation mechanisms to complicate breaching. These defences pose a major tactical challenge to Ukrainian offensive operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian armour is rarely used for attempts at breakthrough. Instead, armour is largely employed in a fire support function to deliver accurate fire against Ukrainian positions. Russia has started to employ thermal camouflage on its vehicles and, using a range of other modifications and tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), has significantly reduced the detectability of tanks at stand-off ranges. Furthermore, these measures have reduced the probability of kill of a variety of anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) at ranges beyond 1,400 m.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian artillery has begun to significantly refine the Reconnaissance Strike Complex following the destruction of its ammunition stockpiles and command and control infrastructure by guided multiple-launch rocket systems (GMLRS) in July 2022. This has resulted in much closer integration of multiple UAVs directly supporting commanders authorised to apply fires. Russian artillery has also improved its ability to fire from multiple positions and to fire and move, reducing susceptibility to counterbattery fire. The key system enabling this coordination appears to be the Strelets system. There has been a shift in reliance upon 152-mm howitzers to a much greater emphasis on 120-mm mortars in Russian fires; this reflects munitions and barrel availability. Responsive Russian fires represent the greatest challenge to Ukrainian offensive operations. Russian artillery is also increasingly relying on loitering munitions for counterbattery fires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian electronic warfare (EW) remains potent, with an approximate distribution of at least one major system covering each 10 km of front. These systems are heavily weighted towards the defeat of UAVs and tend not to try and deconflict their effects. Ukrainian UAV losses remain at approximately 10,000 per month. Russian EW is also apparently achieving real time interception and decryption of Ukrainian Motorola 256-bit encrypted tactical communications systems, which are widely employed by the Armed Forces of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian air defences have also seen a significant increase in their effectiveness now that they are set up around known, and fairly static, locations and are properly connected. Although Russia has persistently struggled to respond to emerging threats, over time it has adapted. Russian air defences are now assessed by the Ukrainian military to be intercepting a proportion of GMLRS strikes as Russian point defences are directly connected to superior radar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian aviation remains constrained to delivering stand-off effects, ranging from responsive lofted S-8 salvos against Ukrainian forming-up points, to FAB-500 glide bombs delivered from medium altitude to ranges up to 70 km. The Ukrainian military notes that Russia has a large stockpile of FAB-500s and is systematically upgrading them with glide kits. Although they only have limited accuracy, the size of these munitions poses a serious threat. The Russian Aerospace Forces remain a ‘force in being’ and a major threat to advancing Ukrainian forces, although they currently lack the capabilities to penetrate Ukrainian air defences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the destruction of Russian command and control infrastructure in July 2022, the Russian military withdrew major headquarters out of range of GMLRS and placed them in hardened structures. They also wired them into the Ukrainian civil telecommunications network and used field cables to branch from this to brigade headquarters further forward. Assigned assets tend to connect to these headquarters via microlink, significantly reducing their signature. At the same time, from the battalion down, Russian forces largely rely on unencrypted analogue military radios, reflecting a shortage of trained signallers at the tactical level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An overview of Russian adaptation reveals a force that is able to improve and evolve its employment of key systems. There is evidence of a centralised process for identifying shortcomings in employment and the development of mitigations. Nevertheless, much of this adaptation is reactive and is aimed at making up for serious deficiencies in Russian units. The result is a structure that becomes better over time at managing the problems it immediately faces, but also one that struggles to anticipate new threats. The conclusion therefore is that the Russian Armed Forces pose a significant challenge for the Ukrainian military on the defence. Nevertheless, if Ukraine can disrupt Russian defences and impose a dynamic situation on them, Russian units are likely to rapidly lose their coordination. Changes in the air combat environment, for example, have led rapidly to incidents of Russian fratricide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Ukraine’s international partners, supporting Ukraine in liberating its territories is arguably shifting from an emphasis on key systems, to the need for dedicated training and the assurance that equipment provided to the Ukrainian military can be sustained. Tactics will be critical to the effective disruption of Russian forces and their eventual defeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By any reasonable metric, 2022 was a disaster for the Russian military. After its invasion of Ukraine, a combination of uneven and inadequate training, poor force employment, and insufficient forces for sustained large-scale combat operations collectively caused the loss of many of its most capable troops and much of its modern equipment. The ground forces bore the brunt of these losses, though elements of the navy and aerospace forces suffered substantial attrition. Moreover, as international support for Ukraine has led to many Western weapons systems being employed against Russian troops for the first time, the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (AFRF) are confronting challenges they have not previously dealt with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Moscow’s policy has been to continue the war. The ongoing reconstitution of Russian forces, and the pressure from new battlefield factors, have led to significant changes in how the Russian military fights. The study of the AFRF has often been heavily focused on the parsing of Russian doctrine. The relevance of Russian doctrine to how the AFRF fights, however, is becoming increasingly uneven. For Ukraine’s partners to calibrate their ongoing provision of support, it is important that Russia’s emerging tactics are properly understood. It is also important that NATO members, recapitalising their forces to ensure the future deterrence of Russia, understand how the threat is evolving. Although the Russian military may change considerably before its forces directly confront NATO, the evolution is worth tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report describes how Russia is currently carrying out its combat operations in Ukraine. It does not outline in detail which of these tactics are more or less successful, or describe Ukrainian tactics, as these are operationally sensitive. The material contained in this report has been primarily assembled from interviews with and observations of Ukrainian military units in April and May 2023, supported by similar material assembled throughout 2022. This included interviews in April and May 2023 with members of the 1st, 17th, 24th, 25th, 30th, 31st, 51st, 58th, 71st and 112th Brigades of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) across all officer ranks and some enlisted troops. The interviewees had a wide range of experience throughout the war, including the defence of Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Bakhmut and Avdiivka, and participated in offensive operations in Kherson and Kharkiv. The authors also spoke to several officers responsible for data collection, assessment and dissemination of lessons within the General Staff of the AFU, and with members of the staffs from Ukraine’s operational-level commands. The contents of these interviews were compared with the observations of a range of Ukraine’s international partners and from public source imagery and accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report divides the descriptions of Russian tactics by combat function, spanning infantry, engineers, artillery, armour, electronic warfare, air defence, aviation, and command and control. It concludes with an overview of the priorities for those wishing to support Ukraine in liberating its territory. This report should not be considered an academic analysis as it was written in Ukraine from field notes and does not engage extensively with wider literature. Nor, given the limitations on what can be publicly discussed, does it fully endeavour to analyse the implications of what is covered as doing so properly would breach the AFU’s operational security. Instead, this should be understood as reportage informed by sustained and extensive engagement and debriefing of Ukrainian combat units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are ways in which this report – if inappropriately exploited – could be misleading. In the first instance, an analysis that is premised on interviews could easily be a collection of anecdotes, thereby suggesting that isolated examples are reflective of wider trends. To avoid this, this report very rarely cites individual examples but instead outlines points of consistency between multiple accounts from combatants with experience from different sectors. Conversely, however, a report that seeks to describe a general Russian approach risks implying a level of uniformity, coherence and intentionality to tactics that may be very uneven in their application. It is noteworthy that there are regular studies conducted by different technical institutes of the Russian military and their findings are disseminated to combat formations, recommending alterations to the employment of equipment, and structure and application of formations. There is an ongoing process at work in the Russian military to identify lessons. Without unit rotation and collective training, however, it is hard for many of these recommendations to be implemented by troops in contact and the result is differing levels of adoption. At the same time, some tactics are emerging from the bottom up and are being distributed along the front. The reader should bear in mind therefore that the descriptions of how Russia is fighting in this report do not represent the result of a coherent redesign of force structure or combined arms tactics, but rather the adaptation within branches of the Russian military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most importantly, this report is not an operational study and does not seek to predict the likelihood of success in any Ukrainian offensive operations. Public reflections would be utterly inappropriate before any such actions are attempted. Given the roughly 1,200 km of front along which forces are engaged to varying levels of intensity, Russian positions are not uniformly well defended; there are gaps. Equally, not all of that front offers suitable ground for offensive manoeuvre. Just because the Russians have an approach to layered defence does not mean that those defences are well served or equally sophisticated in all sectors. Nevertheless, the tactical challenges outlined in this report are ones that Ukrainian forces will have to contend with to varying degrees in whichever direction they move to reclaim their territory. The authors hope that in outlining these challenges, this report can properly calibrate the expectations of Ukraine’s partners and indicate where their support can make the greatest difference in liberating Ukraine’s land and preserving the lives of its soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;infantry&quot;&gt;Infantry&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the war, the Russian military operated in mechanised Battalion Tactical Groups (BTGs) which were supposed to be combined arms formations comprising mechanised infantry, tanks, artillery and other attached enablers. The Russians had insufficient infantry in their BTGs, while the units lacked cohesion or sufficient staff capacity to properly employ their combined arms elements. Casualties and the failure of the approach have led the AFRF to revert to relying on four infantry unit types: disposable; line; assault; and specialised. These are used in combination in both attack and defence, in a manner shaped by current operational challenges that is not formally codified in doctrine. Line, assault and specialised infantry are generated through the normal Russian recruitment and training system. Line infantry are generally based on mechanised units. They differ from assault infantry in that they have not received specific assault training and are therefore mainly used for supporting tasks, improving and occupying defensive positions. Assault infantry have received additional training, closer to what would be expected of NATO light infantry forces, and are considered to be a skilled and valuable asset. As such, they are spared some of the mundanity and back-breaking labour of digging in for defensive operations in order to prevent fatigue and attrition, and to allow them to conduct rehearsals for offensive operations. Russian Airborne Forces (VDV) and naval infantry units are generally, though not universally, assault units in practice, with a cultural expectation that they will have an esprit de corps, level of competence and appropriately aggressive mindset. Wagner Group and other Russian private military companies (PMCs) have also been involved in the formation of assault units. Specialised infantry might be generated from the infantry, VDV, the professional elements of Wagner Group, Spetsnaz or other corps, but have received additional role-specific training and equipment which allow for a particular kind of employment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s disposable infantry should be considered fundamentally different and are drawn from three principal sources: conscripts from the Luhansk and Donetsk People’s Republics (heavily attrited from early rounds of fighting); prisoners drafted by the Wagner Group; and under-trained mobilised Russian civilians. These troops were originally formed into companies of approximately 60 people, but have since been broken down into platoons of approximately 15. They are issued with small arms. Ukrainian troops report that they often appear to be under the influence of amphetamines or other narcotic substances, with material recovered from the battlefield indicating that these are commonly taken in liquid form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the attack, disposable infantry are the first to be employed. Disposable platoons are assigned to those avenues of approach to Ukrainian positions that are deemed to offer some cover and thus could prove viable. Although these have been described colloquially as ‘human wave attacks’, they no longer involve a dense concentration of infantry conducting an assault in a single mass. Rather, a disposable fire team of two to five personnel is sent from a forming-up position in the Russian front line and advances to contact. There may be up to five fire teams pushed across an axis at any one time, but normally only one or two teams will be able to work forwards. The team will skirmish with Ukrainian defensive positions on contact, often until killed. Ukrainian troops noted that many continued to advance, even after being wounded. On more than one occasion Ukrainian soldiers report that disposable infantry have been shot from Russian positions when attempting to retreat. As teams are destroyed by defensive fire, Russian forces will commit successive teams forward by the same line of approach. Ukrainian forces must continuously defend their positions against consecutive waves, expending ammunition, exposing the locations of their defensive positions, and exhausting their personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If these attacks were executed by capable assault troops motivated by factors other than coercion and narcotics, they would be roughly equivalent to historical assault tactics such as the ‘short attacks’ of the Chinese People’s Volunteer Army in the Korean War. The term ‘human wave attacks’ is certainly misleading for probes by successive small assault teams against enemy defences. However, the way that they are conducted is not conducive to successful assaults nor to the maintenance of momentum. Rather, the continuous conduct of this activity, across all axes, is a form of reconnaissance that allows the Russian forces to do two things. First, they find points of weakness in the Ukrainian defences where these troops make surprising amounts of progress or face very limited fire. These are then prioritised for deliberate assault. Alternatively, where the defence is strong, the revelation of Ukrainian firing positions allows specialised troops to begin targeting them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian specialised troops are deployed as irregular groupings of snipers, artillery spotters and support weapon operators. While Ukrainian forces are suppressing disposable infantry, additional disposable troops are often pushed forwards as working groups to dig fox holes and prepare firing positions closer to Ukrainian defences. These personnel are withdrawn and replaced by specialists who can establish observation and sniping posts or set up heavy weapons. They can then be used to direct accurate fire against Ukrainian firing posts from a range of up to 2 km and inflict attrition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, if a weaker point is identified and a deliberate assault is planned, the approach is to move additional disposable troops to dig forward positions for specialised infantry. Rather than seeking to simply attrit the defence, this becomes a base of fire. Furthermore, artillery fire shifts from harassment to barrage, enabling Russian assault infantry to attack – often favouring a flank. Assault infantry tend to advance in company strength with the support of armour and, among better Russian units, utilising a mixture of artillery systems. 152-mm howitzers fire until the assault is 400 m from the target position, after which fire is taken over by 122-mm howitzer or 120-mm mortar fire until the assault closes to its final assault positions. The final advance is covered by infantry mortars and then grenades are used before entering the target position. These troops tend to endeavour to turn the flank of a defensive position. On taking a position, they are often withdrawn and replaced by line infantry and additional disposable troops who set about fortifying the position so that it can be held as a base for further probing actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that, in the attack, Assault Detachments (‘Штурмовые отряды’) have long held a place in Soviet and Russian military doctrine, and the Russian military has produced updated manuals detailing how these should be structured and employed. In some ways the guidance provided is reflected in Russian offensive operations. The digging of forward positions in preparation for attacks, the use of artillery, the way that armoured vehicles are used separately for stand-off fire support, the use of specialist enabling teams, and the division of infantry platoons into three-to-five-man fire-teams, are all in evidence, although with great variation from the strict doctrinal task organisation provided. Furthermore, probably because to do so would be politically untenable, the doctrine makes no distinction between the specially trained assault infantry teams that form the backbone of assault detachments and their disposable counterparts. The divergence between doctrine and observed practice likely owes much to the inability of the AFRF to either train according to the doctrine or implement it effectively and consistently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the defence, Russian forces largely occupy company fighting positions with platoon-sized elements that utilise minefields and obstacles to slow down and fix attackers before calling for heavy defensive artillery fire. If forced from their positions, they will utilise artillery fires to prevent either breakthroughs or consolidation by the attacker. Although Russian defensive operations have been criticised as being overly positional, they do hold ground combat units in reserve for mobile defence. Although their less capable units have consistently proven sluggish and reactive, on occasion they have launched rapid, aggressive counterattacks to retake lost positions in response to successful Ukrainian assaults.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is notable that Russian doctrine, with a heavy emphasis on direct and indirect fires, has long prescribed that formations should dig in as soon as possible when static. If no engineering support is available, they are to do so by hand, and are to continue to improve their positions for the duration that they occupy them. As a result, Russian positions often include an extensive range of well-prepared fighting positions. Once Russian troops have taken a position, it is reliably fortified within 12 hours through the digging of fox holes or blasting on less favourable ground. This is rapidly augmented in frontline positions with cut-down trees to create strongpoints for support weapons. Positions are reinforced with concrete where possible, although this is rarely the case in the first line. They also make limited use of decoy positions to obscure the layout of their actual defensive positions and fires plan, although the extent of this practice varies across units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Russian defence lines are significant and the units holding them post sentries, the Russians make very little use of observation or listening posts pushed forward of their main positions. Active reconnaissance, other than advancing to contact with disposable troops, is largely carried out by UAVs. Indeed, Russian troops appear to be reluctant to expose themselves through reconnaissance. Even when reconnaissance units work forward, it is usually to launch UAVs. It is typical for there to be between 25 and 50 UAVs from both sides operating over the contested area between the forward line of own troops (FLOT) and forward line of enemy troops (FLET) at any given time for each 10 km of frontage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, this force structure is a cynical but coherent solution to the problem facing the Russian Ground Forces; they are able to mobilise large numbers of personnel but most units are poor quality and suffer from a chronic lack of training capacity that might otherwise rectify the problem. The segmented tasking within an unevenly trained force places correspondingly uneven burdens on its different components. The losses among disposable infantry are extremely high. Conversely, because specialised troops are largely held back and often fight from well-prepared positions, the Russians are able to preserve these soldiers thereby steadily increasing the skill of these operators. Meanwhile, assault troops are preserved from some of the worst of the fighting and receive better body armour and equipment. They are often only committed under the most favourable circumstances, meaning they can achieve their objectives and be rotated out with limited losses. On the other hand, when they are committed under less favourable circumstances, whether because of Ukrainian deception measures or miscalculation by their command, these forces are assigned the most dangerous task and are thus prone to mass casualty incidents. It is also worth noting that the competence of these units varies considerably and depends on the proportion of replacements in the force, the level of training received and their resulting unit cohesion. VDV and naval infantry units, for example, have seen significant qualitative decline over the course of the war owing to regeneration. By contrast, because Wagner assault units often comprise companies, they are either lost or succeed. Moreover, the higher pay attracts experienced personnel from contract infantry and leads to more capable specialist Wagner units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The critical and yet most elusive variable in assessing the strength of Russian military units is morale. Generally, it is low, with a rise in prosecutions for desertion, observed instances of wounded comrades being abandoned, and very little depth of junior leadership. Personnel are also rarely rotated and there is considerable weariness across the force. In theory, this should make Russian units brittle. In practice, they appear to be able to take very heavy punishment without collapsing. Instead, morale problems appear to manifest in poor cooperation within units and even less between them. The result is a tendency for coordination and cohesion to fracture under pressure. This is likely to make Russian units underperform in defence if they can be forced to move or engage in a dynamic action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;engineers&quot;&gt;Engineers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps one of the least discussed elements of the Russian forces during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine has been its engineers. In contrast to much of the Russian forces, its engineers have performed well. The aforementioned speed with which Russian infantry dig, and the scale at which they improve their fighting positions, is noteworthy and is supplemented by combat engineers. Two engineer companies are assigned to each brigade, one focused on mining and the other on force protection engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian force protection engineering has largely followed its doctrine, with little methodological change since the Cold War. Russian defensive positions generally comprise two to three lines, depending on the context. The first line, along the line of contact, comprises the fighting positions made by the infantry. The second constitutes properly made trenches – as compared with fox holes in the first – and concrete firing posts where possible. Several obstacle belts are laid in front of these positions, usually formed with a 4-m-deep and 6-m-wide anti-tank ditch, dragons’ teeth and wire track entanglements. The trench positions are usually structured as company fighting positions in wood blocks and on ridge lines, placed to cover areas of open ground with fire, rather than as contiguously occupied front lines. The depth of the defence line is usually 5 km from the first, and each belt of physical defences tends to span between 700 m and a kilometre, so that the entire obstacle series is covered by fire. The third line usually comprises fall-back fighting positions and concealed areas for reserves, with positions dug for vehicles. Command posts (CPs), meanwhile, tend to be subterranean and fortified with concrete. The overall depth of defensive fortifications exceeds 30 km on some axes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minefields are another element of the Russian defence line. These rarely follow a discernible pattern and are seldom marked. Ukrainian forces note that the Russians have no shortage of mines, creating mixed fields containing both anti-tank (AT) and anti-personnel (AP) mines. Russia is not a signatory of the 1997 Ottawa Treaty, meaning its forces freely utilise victim-initiated AP mines. They tend to leave lanes for rearward movement between the forward, first and second defence lines. There is also a strong preference for mining the approaches to natural choke points. In some cases, an AP mine may be placed directly on top of the AT mine. Initiation mechanisms are also often mixed. It is common for AP mines, for example, to be initiated by a seismic sensor and to have an immediately adjacent mine initiated by wires, which are laid out in a cross from the device. The Russians have also made extensive use of magnetically activated AT mines delivered via multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS). Although Russian forces have been successful in tracking the routes through their own minefields, they have performed less well in breaching mine belts laid by the AFU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another area in which the Russians have demonstrated persistent competence is in the emplacement of bridges. These are largely held at the Combined Arms Army level and assigned to support operations. Engineering units usually emplace them rapidly and there is no evidence that the Russian Ground Forces lack for pontoon bridges, even if their river crossing operations have exhibited serious shortcomings overall. Russian forces are sufficiently confident that they can rapidly deploy bridging that they have at times destroyed bridges, even on routes that they intend to utilise, because they assess that the disruption to Ukrainian forces is greater than the burden of having to erect pontoons across the gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;artillery&quot;&gt;Artillery&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artillery reamins at the heart of the Russian military. During the initial invasion, between one and two batteries of howitzers were assigned to each BTG along with an MLRS battery. By summer 2022, the Russians had consolidated artillery into artillery tactical groups. Russia is currently utilising artillery brigades, which allocate batteries in support of axes, and hold a significant force under direct command for counterbattery fire and to support the sector’s main effort. Russian fires continue to be the main shaping effect on the fighting. The rate of Russian fire during the first quarter of 2023 fluctuated between 12,000 and 38,000 rounds per day. The number of days in which Russian fires exceeded 24,000 rounds is now much scarcer, and it is notable that – in terms of the allocation of fires – Russian artillery ammunition and barrel allocations are assigned to fewer priority axes. There has also been a shift in the calibres being most widely utilised with a relative reduction in the volume of 152-mm fire and a significant increase in the volume of 120-mm mortar fire. Thus, whereas total ammunition expenditure in 2022 was approximately 12 million rounds, fluctuating between 20,000 and 60,000 rounds fired per day, Russian fires in 2023 are currently trending closer towards 7 million rounds if the current rate of fire is maintained for the remainder of the year. Ukrainian estimates place current Russian shell production at 2.5 million rounds per year. This is likely to increase, although access to explosive energetics constrains it. Due to the disparity in expenditure versus production, additional rounds are purchased from the international market. Nevertheless, with a projected consumption rate of 7 million rounds over the whole of 2023, Russia will have to be more discerning in where it prioritises its fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ammunition availability has shaped employment. The Russians had no difficulty in amassing ammunition around their guns in Donbas in summer 2022. After HIMARS strikes disrupted these supply practices, and the availability of accurate long-range Western howitzers in the AFU made this stockpiling difficult, the Russian approach to fire control was disrupted. What has followed has been a process of experimentation and refinement that is beginning to produce new tactics. The Russians have introduced two terms into their fires lexicon: ‘immediate value’; and ‘weight of salvo’. The first reflects the uneven effects of fire based on the tactical context and thus the need for precise timing of the delivery of fires in relation to the wider actions of a unit. Thus, fires planning is now framed as a series of decision points. The second – weight of salvo – is also reflective of a shift in emphasis to the timing of effects, desiring to land the greatest weight within a defined period to maximise effect. The patterns of fire are being described as ‘Nomadic Cannon’, ‘Fiery Carousel’, ‘Roaming Platoon’ and ‘Umbrella Cover’. The Nomadic Cannon reflects harassing fire, delivered from mobile firing points, often to draw counterbattery fire or conduct artillery raids. The Fiery Carousel reflects a means of maintaining survivability while sustaining barrage. The Roaming Platoon concept envisages manoeuvring guns maximising the weight of salvo deliverable against a target. Umbrella Cover is essentially a means of suppression. Gun positions are no longer dug. Instead, a battery will conceal itself in a woodblock and move to a firing position where ammunition will have been placed for a defined salvo. It will then move to the next. If fixed by counterbattery fire, operators tend to leave their guns and seek cover, only returning to them when it is safe to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fire is not only used to strike Ukrainian defensive positions but also, vitally, to blunt assaults. If the Russians learn that an assault is being prepared, the area is often saturated with fire to prevent its execution. Another common tactic is for the Russians to withdraw from a position that is being assaulted and then saturate it with fire once Ukrainian troops attempt to occupy it. Ukrainian forces report that while the weight of artillery fire remains high, MLRS launches are significantly less than in previous months, suggesting munitions shortages. It appears that Russia has a steady supply of Krasnopol laser-guided 152-mm rounds as there is an observed increase in the number of Orlan-30 flights and the use of designators by specialised infantry to deliver more accurate strikes on Ukrainian defensive positions. Russian counterbattery fire has also shifted away from the saturation of detected Ukrainian positions to the firing of Lancet loitering munitions. Although these have a limited success rate, their speed and accuracy make it challenging to maintain sustained firing for Ukrainian guns to support manoeuvre. Lancets are also used for reconnaissance to actively hunt for Ukrainian artillery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More consequential than adaptations in firing sequences has been the refinement of the Russian Reconnaissance Fires Circuit (Russian term for the kill chain) to make it more responsive and more flexible in delivering fire to support manoeuvring forces. Each commander of an axis will generally retain an orbit of Orlan-10s above the fighting to provide both information to the CP and targets for responsive and accurate fire to the assigned batteries. The artillery brigade commander also often retains several Orlan-10s, coordinated in a complex above areas of interest. Thus, Ukrainian forces often find that they are being observed from two different Orlan-10 complexes – each able to call down different effects. The time for artillery engagements from these systems remains rapid at around 3–5 minutes. Engagement from electronic warfare (EW) detection is longer at around 20–30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One underappreciated aspect of Russian fires reconnaissance early in the conflict was the Strelets system. It allows multiple feeds from ground-based sensors or detections by reconnaissance troops to be programmed and transmitted through a wide range of bearers, which are then integrated into Russian digital fire control. Few Russian units were found to have Strelets during the initial invasion, and even among those that had it, it was often not set up properly or left in baggage. Although the low quality of training among Russian troops means that it is still not prevalent, it is widely used among specialist infantry assigned to VDV and Wagner formations. These personnel use Strelets to either place sensors close to Ukrainian positions or report and correct for fire for Russian artillery to enable accurate engagements. The combination of calls for fires enabled by Strelets, combined with the Reconnaissance Fire Complexes (RFCs) of higher echelons fires using organic ISR is outlined in Figure 1. The figure shows three interlocking kill chains or ‘reconnaissance fires circuits’ from a direct link between reconnaissance and fires assets, to a link between reconnaissance assets through a fire control to a battery, and the ability of a higher headquarters to assign alternate ‘means of destruction’ against a detected target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actions of Russian assault groups against the village of Artemivske in December 2022 provides a useful illustration of the application of the RFC as it has developed in Ukraine. Several UAVs were used to fly above the assault groups in the city: one conducted reconnaissance outside the city against the positions of the Ukrainian artillery; another maintained observation over possible routes for transferring reserves; a third preceded the assault group to identify Ukrainian ambushes and firing positions; and a fourth flew above the assault group itself, giving the assault group commander real time observation of the tactical situation. If any of the UAVs identified a target, the UAV operator would pass the coordinates to the assault group commander. If the target was to be engaged with artillery this would be either ordered by the assault group commander and carried out by the artillery attached to the group, or transferred to the higher command, operating its own UAVs over the area, which could take over the fire mission with its assets. In this instance, the engagements were managed by the Strelets system. The applied architecture for this bypassing of centralised fire control for the delivery of effects through a tiered RFC is outlined in Figure 2. In the figure, information flows from the UAV both to the CP, but also to a fire observer directly to the barrels via the Strelets system, indicated by the black line. Thus the commander is on, but does not need to be in the loop for the engagement to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;armour&quot;&gt;Armour&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian use of armour has evolved significantly during the conflict. The BTG concept included the use of armour in company groups to punch into operational depth. After taking massive losses, the Russians shifted to using armour for attempts at breakthrough when conditions were propitious. Now, tanks are very rarely used in this way, with the destruction of a Russian naval infantry brigade in Vuhledar attempting such an armoured thrust, reinforcing Russia’s caution in using such tactics under current conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, tanks tend to operate in three ways. First, they are used to supplement artillery capabilities through indirect engagements. This is particularly notable in sectors off the Russian main effort where there is not a sufficient allocation of air defences to protect a robust logistics architecture capable of supporting a large numbers of guns. Because of the low angle of indirect fire engagements by tanks, they make for an inefficient form of artillery. Nevertheless, these engagements can often be made from positions that would not be viable for artillery because of the tanks greater protection and thus reduced vulnerability to counterbattery fire, enabling tanks to fill in the gap in firing while guns displace or become suppressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, tanks are used as highly accurate fire support assets able to stand off at 2 km and utilise their enhanced optics to identify and knock out firing positions. It is important to note that while the introduction of older tanks such as the T62 and T55 to the field has been mocked online, these vehicles are largely being used in the role of the fire support function offered by BMPs and other infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs). They represent an increase in range, protection and kinetic effect over these IFVs, and therefore pose a serious battlefield threat when there are a limited number of anti-tank guided weapons able to reach them at their stand-off range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third use of armour is in raiding. Because of the continual pressure that Russian infantry place Ukrainian positions under, this requires regular troop rotations. Striking troops during these rotations significantly increases the likelihood of inflicting casualties, so the Russians often conduct gun raids with tanks when they detect troop rotations. These are often carried out at night, specifically utilising T80BV with its better thermal optics. The aim is to rapidly approach the target sector, fire as many rounds as possible within a short space of time and withdraw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One important development is that the Russians have made several modifications to their tanks that are reducing the effectiveness of anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs). First, they are fitting vehicles – as well as many defensive positions – with anti-thermal material, which is proving highly effective. Second, modification to the engine deck and thus the heat plume from the vehicle’s exhaust and engine is reducing the reliability of where certain ATGMs engage the target. Third, by fighting at dusk and dawn when the vehicle temperature is most similar to the ambient temperature of the surroundings (known as ‘thermal crossover’), the vehicles are harder to detect through thermal imagery. The result is a significant decrease in the probability of kill from several ATGM types, although this is only achievable by imposing a range of tactical constraints on the employment of Russian armour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exceptions to the patterns outlined above can be found in urban fighting where distances often collapse. Although Russian forces have proven very cautious in using armour in Bakhmut, they have pushed armour in a supporting fire role for infantry in other urban battles. Here, tanks have proven critical for both suppression of urban structures and rapid breaching of buildings to avoid entering through choke points and known avenues of advance. The use of older tanks as assault guns in this role appears to be preferred as the urban environment does not give more modern Russian tanks with advanced optics and multispectral concealment a sufficient tactical advantage to justify their loss. Of course, as tanks are drawn into urban areas for this purpose, they also risk coming into direct contact with enemy armour, with armoured clashes sometimes taking place from distances as close as 50 m.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tank-on-tank engagements have become relatively rare, but when they occur they usually take place within 1,000 m. Engagement speed has been the determining factor in these clashes. Ukrainian tankers note that one-shot kills are possible if the point between the turret and glacis is hit. Russian explosive reactive armour (ERA), however, has proven highly effective, preventing most anti-tank systems from defeating the tank’s armour. Some operators have reported hitting tanks multiple times with barrel-launched ATGMs without knocking them out. Significantly, Ukrainian tankers report that mobility kills against the vehicle’s tracks are also an effective means of removing Russian armour from the field because they usually cause the crew to abandon the vehicle. This is because a tank’s mobility is considered the best means of protection against artillery and its survivability is compromised if it is immobilised. On several occasions, this tendency for stricken armour to be abandoned has led to extended skirmishing by both sides to try and recover damaged vehicles. On balance, Russian fires superiority tends to prevent Ukrainian troops from successfully lifting enemy armour under these conditions, meaning the vehicles are usually denied with artillery to prevent their recovery and repair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;electronic-warfare&quot;&gt;Electronic Warfare&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electronic warfare remains a critical component of the Russian way of fighting. While there was an extremely high density of EW systems in Donbas in 2022, the AFRF now employ approximately one major EW system per 10 km of frontage, usually situated approximately 7 km from the frontline, with more specialised EW capabilities sat at higher echelon. These platforms are usually aimed at controlling and defeating UAVs. Interestingly, there is minimal interest among Russian crews in synchronising these effects with other activities or with deconflicting their effects. Instead, for the period when an EW team is deployed, it is weapons free with its system and tends to aggressively attack Ukrainian systems. The Shipovnik-Aero is proving a particularly effective system because it has a low signature and can further obfuscate this by imitating other emitters and communications devices. It also has a sophisticated range of effects for downing UAVs. The Russian military is also continuing to make extensive use of navigational interference in the battle area as a form of electronic protection. This is contributing to a Ukrainian loss rate in UAVs of approximately 10,000 per month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another function of Russian EW troops is interception and decryption of Ukrainian military communications. The Russian military is proving highly capable in this area. Ukrainian officers recalled one incident in which the Russian headquarters gave pre-emptive warning to its units of an artillery strike based on Ukrainian troops calling in a fire mission. The Ukrainian troops were communicating with Motorola radios with 256-bit encryption, but it appeared that the Russians were able to capture and decrypt these transmissions in near real time. The most likely system for such functions is the Torn-MDM. When the Russians are not intercepting traffic, Ukrainian units note that they are reliably able to suppress the receivers on Motorola radios out to approximately 10 km beyond the FLET.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside large systems such as the Shipovnik-Aero, the Russian military has been extensively rolling out EW effectors to be organic to units at all echelons. This includes counter-UAS capabilities assigned to each platoon, which usually include directional jammers and arrays for hijacking UAVs. Ukrainian forces now assess that at least one of these systems is available to each platoon within Russian line infantry units. Another EW function in the counter-UAS fight is deception measures that generate a large number of fake UAVs on enemy systems and replicate ground control stations. While the Russian military is yet to widely exploit the creation of a large number of false targets, it has the capability to do so – and these actions are growing more prevalent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;air-defence&quot;&gt;Air Defence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The performance of Russian air defence systems has steadily improved. Early setbacks due to poor coordination and planning saw Ukraine successfully strike Russian formations during the initial week of the war. The Russians rapidly established a more robust coverage over their tactical formations, which quickly denied airspace to the Ukrainian Air Force. Nevertheless, this was premised on a large number of dispersed air defence systems, and these proved vulnerable to complex attacks involving anti-radiation missiles and EW effects. The Russians also found that dispersed air defence systems were incapable of intercepting a range of threats, including guided multiple launch rocket systems (GMLRS) used to devastate Russian command and control and logistics in July 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian air defences have become significantly more robust since the autumn of 2022. Complexes of SA-21 and SA-23 are now stationed around key logistical and C2 hubs. Critically, they appear to have SA-15 and SA-22 connected to their fire control radars, significantly improving the situational awareness and track data quality of these short-range air defence (SHORAD) systems. This has had two principal effects. First, the long-range radar, combined with systems such as the 48Ya6 ‘Podlet-K1’ all-altitude radar, have proven highly effective in denying airspace to Ukrainian aviation. Second, Russian SHORAD systems have massively improved their point defence efficiency. Along with the successful interception of most high-speed anti-radiation missiles (HARMs) fired by Ukrainian aircraft, the Russian air defence network is now assessed to be achieving a significant number of intercepts against GMLRS munitions. The exact intercept rate depends on the depth of the target and the number of GMLRS fired, so that a precise proportion of intercepts cannot be meaningfully given. Russian air defences are clearly much more effective in defence when they can be properly connected, than in a dynamic context where they are having to cover advancing forces. This allows Russian crews to achieve optimal efficiency against the current range of threats. It is noteworthy however that Russian crews have always lagged in reacting appropriately to new threats, and struggle to maintain effective blue force tracking, leading to several blue-on-blue engagements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The efficiency of Russian long-range surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) against the Ukrainian Air Force has also remained significant. The longest-known shoot-down against Ukrainian aircraft was at 150 km when the aircraft was flying lower than 50 feet. This appears to have been cued by a 48Ya6 ‘Podlet-K1’ all-altitude radar with the air defence missile achieving a post-apex lock on the target. The strength of the air defence network is bolstered by persistent combat air patrols at medium altitude by Russian Su-35Ss. Using R-37 missiles, these aircraft pose a significant threat at very long range. According to the Ukrainian Air Force, the longest-range recorded kill by a Russian R-37 was at 177 km. Although separate from the air defence system, the combination of threat from long-range ground-based anti-air capabilities, medium-altitude look-down radar, long-range air-to-air missiles, and effective point defence systems makes the air combat environment extremely lethal. For this reason, most Ukrainian fast air and attack aviation engagements utilise S-7 rockets, fired in a lofted profile from above Ukrainian positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;aviation&quot;&gt;Aviation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the greater density and integration of Russian air defences, the VKS continues to be reluctant to push into Ukrainian airspace. Russian aviation has largely continued to conduct stand-off attacks. First, aviation-launched cruise missiles now constitute the majority of stand-off effects used for the protracted targeting of Ukrainian sites. The Tu-95 fleet remains the backbone of this capability. It is noteworthy that a large number of aircraft are assigned to these strikes, with a relatively small proportion of aircraft firing the munitions. Here, the VKS has adapted in response to the limited number of strikes possible per month leading to Ukrainian defences gaining significant warning time of strikes through the take-off of these aircraft. Given that Russian industry can deliver approximately 40 long-range missiles of varying types per month, the VKS launches large numbers of aircraft to increase the number of potential axes of threat, using Shahed-136 UAVs as pathfinders to identify gaps in Ukrainian air defence and then firing from a small number of aircraft to maximise the proportion of missiles that reach their target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stand-off effects are also the principal means of the VKS conducting strikes in tactical depth, largely employing FAB-500 bombs with glide kits launched from Su-35Ss; with a potential range of up to 70 km, these munitions have relatively poor accuracy. The AFU notes that the VKS holds substantial stockpiles of FAB-500s and is systematically preparing glide kits for them, potentially providing a large number of available heavy bombs. For now, Russian use of these munitions has been small, although strikes have been persistent. It is anticipated, however, that these strikes are providing data for the refinement of the glide kits and, more importantly, for the calculation tables used to determine when they are released, which may see an improvement in accuracy over time. If employed with greater concentration, it is also anticipated that this capability will begin to be employed against battlefield targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other stand-off strike method is lofting S-8 unguided rockets from both fast air and aviation assets on a long arcing trajectory at distant targets. The technique, first seen soon after the invasion, has been the subject of significant curiosity due to its inefficiency and inaccuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when conducted at ranges of approximately 12 km at area targets such as Ukrainian ground formations attempting to form up for attacks, the concentration of effect has proved sufficient to break up these formations and prevent attacks from taking place. Interestingly, these lofting strikes appear to be the primary use of Russian attack aviation on the current battlefield. Although the technique is used across the front, its most pronounced effects are in areas where the Russians have a dearth of ground-based fires, as the responsiveness of this method of attack can increase the threat to Ukrainian troops with very little notice. The second use of Russian aviation is the application of EW effects. There are believed to be eight Russian Mi-17s with EW suites operating in southern Ukraine. These are being utilised to some effect for the purposes of electronic attack against Ukrainian command and control, and through their altitude are able to do so in greater depth than is achievable by comparable systems based on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The VKS remains something of an enigma in the conflict. On the one hand, it retains significant firepower and a large fleet of available aircraft with munitions. On the other hand, its presence is limited. The challenge for Ukraine is that Russian fast air, and particularly its large extant attack aviation fleet, could inflict massive damage if committed in numbers, even if this would be costly. So long as this represents a latent threat, it must have a shaping effect on Ukrainian offensive operations, as advancing Ukrainian forces are likely to face similar challenges to the Russians in advancing their air defence coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prize to be fought for in this regard is the ability to operate at medium altitude beyond the engagement ceiling of shoulder-fired man-portable air-defence systems (MANPADS). Whichever side can operate sustainably in this altitude band can more easily identify targets and bomb with much greater range and accuracy. At present, the VKS is deterred by the SAM threat from adopting such a profile over the Ukrainian frontlines. However, probably the single greatest extant threat that could change the tactical dynamics on the ground is if the VKS gains the freedom to operate at medium altitude over Ukrainian positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;command-and-control&quot;&gt;Command and Control&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GMLRS strikes by Ukrainian forces in July 2022 pushed Russian headquarters back to beyond 120 km from the FLOT. In autumn 2022, this distance imposed significant tactical challenges on Russian forces. However, these challenges had largely been overcome by winter. Russian headquarters are now more dispersed and are connected to forward CPs by wiring. This has often been achieved by commandeering the Ukrainian telecommunications network on the occupied territories, which is dense and robust. The Russian military then connect its CPs to the closest point in the civilian network via extended ground-laid telecommunications cables. Brigade CPs remain pushed back from the front line, usually to a distance of 20 km, but are often well protected, being situated underground in reinforced structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dispersion of orders from CPs to key assets such as air defence, EW and other systems has been observed to depend on microlinks in the first instance, often using relay vehicles to increase the range at which combat management can be carried out. Microlink use has significantly decreased the detectability of these systems. It is noted that brigade to battalion CPs are often either connected via microlink relays or field cable, which are usually laid within 24 hours of a CP being established.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the low detectability of these command links, Russian communications from the battalion CP downwards are not just dependent on radios but often on analogue military systems and tend to be communicated in clear rather than encrypted. This is presumed to be the result of the limited training provided to many components of the force. Moreover, while some units have developed forms of veiled speech, most do not adhere to these practices. The exception to this is among reconnaissance units and artillery observers able to utilise systems such as Strelets and Azart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As regards cooperation between units, Russian forces continue to struggle to be horizontally integrated in their C2. The layering of fires, for example, between combined arms army assets, brigade artillery and battalion mortars, demonstrates reasonable fires integration between echelons. However, there is limited application of cross-boundary fires between sectors. Nor is there much evidence that units have the means to communicate laterally. Instead, information is passed upwards, then across at the brigade level or higher, and then downwards. This is a major limitation in Russian defensive operations as it creates seams that must be covered by higher echelons with organic assets. Integration of VKS capabilities also remains tied to the Combined Arms Army CP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;priority-assistance-for-the-armed-forces-of-ukraine&quot;&gt;Priority Assistance for the Armed Forces of Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Ukraine prepares for offensive operations, it is important to consider the tactical challenges that the AFU will face. How Ukraine plans to overcome these challenges is operationally sensitive and will not be detailed in this report. Nevertheless, some priorities for those supporting Ukrainian forces can be identified through the analysis of Russian capabilities outlined above, and by some of those issues facing the AFU which are already clearly identifiable in open sources. Russian infantry, when properly supported, can make Ukrainian offensive operations challenging. Specifically, the volume of Russian fires, their protection by air defences, the extent of Russian force protection engineering, and the ability to disrupt mobile command and control all represent tactical challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Russia’s defensive operations are positional, a cardinal sin among adherents of manoeuvre warfare, defeating the layers of prepared defences still presents a problem. These defences are not absolutely positional, with Russian forces utilising some mobile reserves at the tactical level. The depth of the defences means that Ukraine must generate serious combat power to penetrate the Russian lines, and the extent of Russian defensive fortifications across the front makes bypassing them nearly impossible. Even if Ukrainian forces achieve a breakthrough in future, and regain their ability to manoeuvre, this will require localised breakthroughs and mopping up operations against bypassed defensive positions. This means that, although there are a variety of likely tasks for Ukrainian ground units and they will need to be able to manoeuvre, training for assault operations against fortified positions constitutes a critical training priority for Ukrainian troops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first obstacle for Ukrainian forces is winning the indirect fires duel. In the face of enemy artillery dominance, offensive manoeuvre is extremely costly. Ukraine’s international partners have provided a large number of artillery systems and the country is receiving a consistent supply of ammunition, although the natures provided do not always reflect the balance of calibres available to the AFU. However, the real issue is that the priority for provisioning Ukrainian artillery for defence has left its fires system lopsided in its capabilities. Ukrainian artillery has ample means to blunt Russian advances, with an effective fire control architecture and the ability to coordinate engagements from multiple dispersed guns. However, suppression of a superior number of Russian artillery systems requires counterbattery capabilities to rapidly detect and engage enemy firing positions. It is evident that if Ukrainian forces are to set the conditions in any sector for offensive action, its international partners should prioritise the provision of detection systems for directing counterbattery fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winning the firefight in direct engagements is also critical, as suppressing enemy positions during assault actions is essential. As regards heavy weapons, a significant emphasis has been placed on . calibre heavy machine guns equipping Ukrainian units. While these are highly effective, their fire has a very flat trajectory. They would be complemented well by automatic grenade launchers such as the Mk. 19 Grenade Machine Gun (GMG), which would pose a greater threat to enemy troops in trenches or dug into open positions, given the arcing trajectory of rounds. Assisting Ukrainian forces with winning the direct firefight is also worthwhile because, unlike some other capabilities, it can be improved in a standalone fashion, the training and weapons systems in question not requiring other dependencies to be in place before adding value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mine clearing and breaching is another area where Ukraine’s partners must prioritise support. The key requirement is likely minefield reconnaissance. The utilisation of machine learning tools with UAV reconnaissance could be a means of identifying fields. Nevertheless, reconnaissance in this function is also likely to require human scouting and marking, which is a difficult skill and should be taught so Ukrainian reconnaissance troops can do this at night. It is also important to note that while offensive obstacle breaching at tempo is something that Western militaries have under-resourced, counter-IED equipment and tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) developed during the war on terror do have applicability. The challenge is adapting these to work under an indirect fire threat that was not significant when these tactics were first employed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the emphasis for international support has understandably been on equipment. Tactics, however, will be decisive in determining whether Ukrainian infantry are able to succeed on the battlefield, particularly the challenge of taking entrenched and fortified positions protected by minefields and supporting fires. While there are several critical skill sets that can be identified, there are a variety of common battle drills that are the bread and butter of well-trained ground combat and combat support units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Ukraine faces multiple pressures which serve as major impediments to honing the skills, tactical coordination and group cohesion of its units. It is required to deploy its best units on ongoing operations along an extended front line in eastern Ukraine. Furthermore, Ukraine’s training establishments are having to process an influx of new recruits with limited prior military training. These recruits must both replace the casualties from existing units and facilitate the expansion of the AFU. This is no easy feat and comes after the training establishments were severely disrupted early in the war, including in some cases being physically overrun by Russian Ground Forces, or having the instructors and students mobilised at the beginning of the war as an emergency measure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scale of training assistance required should therefore not be underestimated, for it is substantial and complex. Collective training for units must be prioritised, with a particular focus on fire control for direct and indirect fire support units to maximise suppression without wasting ammunition, effective tactical command and control of, and between, fire support, engineering and assault units to ensure effective suppression during breaching and assaults without fratricide, and the conduct of assaults themselves. The relevant battle drills are not particularly complex conceptually, but they must be understood well enough by all involved for there to either be no requirement to submit a planning process beforehand, or for that planning and delivery of orders to be quick and concise so as to minimise vulnerable pauses in operational activity. They require thorough practice under realistic conditions to build sufficient coordination to be effective, and for there to be the speed and momentum to prevent the enemy from responding effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need to build effective assault units with common tactics also speaks to a wider requirement for company-level collective training to ensure consistent TTPs and develop unit cohesion. Here, developing leaders who are able to coordinate multiple elements as part of platoon-, company- and battalion-strength tactical engagements at pace will be vital. The emphasis on individual soldiering skills in UK training provided to Ukrainian recruits, while an important foundation, underplays the vital importance of building formed units if offensive actions are to succeed. If this means slowing down the number of trainees passing through the UK programme by adding an additional couple of weeks of collective training, then the trade-off would be worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Ukrainian units break through the defences, it is vital that they can exploit the gap they have created. If their offensive operations lack momentum, this will lead to a series of sequential assaults against prepared Russian defences – a slow and disproportionately costly way to take ground. Conversely, they will maximise the return on the costs of each assault if they are able to breach and exploit forwards, thereafter, keeping Russian forces on the back foot. To do this, they must maintain tempo and remain protected as they move forwards. This leads to two requirements. For the maintenance of tempo, the availability and serviceability of equipment is vital. While this can be done in defence by recovering vehicles and having trained mechanics work on them, the maintenance of equipment provided by international partners during offensive operations will largely depend on the proficiency of crews in keeping them fighting. For this reason, it is critical that there is an available stockpile of spare parts for all donated equipment, that user manuals have been translated into Ukrainian and distributed to the appropriate units, and that crews have time to properly familiarise themselves with equipment that follows a very different maintenance methodology from platforms on which they have previously operated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second critical requirement for maintaining momentum is the protection of forces that have broken through from counterattacks by those Russian forces held in reserve. Reserve manoeuvre elements can be fixed with artillery so long as they can be located. Defensive enemy artillery fire must be obviated by maintaining momentum and therefore denying the enemy real-time location data on targets. This means disrupting their means of holding units under observation. Meanwhile, protecting units from aviation is critical to prevent a responsive set of strikes to blunt a breakthrough. For the defeat of enemy artillery, some deployable EW capabilities may be useful, but whether for UAVs or aviation, tactical air defence is by far the greatest priority. The ability to have air defence move with and shield manoeuvre elements is a vital area that requires potentially novel support from Ukraine’s partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the disruption of enemy counterattacks or strikes from artillery and aviation would be greatly assisted by the destruction of enemy command and control infrastructure. For this, suppression of the air defences protecting these targets will be important. Assistance in both stand-off electronic attack and the use of tools such as UAVs to threaten and displace air defences or else saturate them with false positives or non-economical targets could all greatly assist in creating confusion, overwhelming enemy decision-making and reducing the level of protection to maximise the impact of Ukrainian GMLRS strikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tendency in much of the international discourse surrounding the Russian military has been to write it off as tactically inept, technically deficient and morally broken. These criticisms have more than a grain of truth to them. Nevertheless, they tend to extrapolate from the performance of certain Russian units to the whole force. Alongside their deficiencies, Russian forces have demonstrated that much of their equipment is effective, highly lethal and adaptable to a range of threats. While there are serious deficiencies in Russian capabilities, these are most pronounced in conducting offensive operations. Conversely, many of Russia’s combat support arms have not only demonstrated reasonable proficiency but have also shown that they are able to adapt to emerging threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Russian forces have started to resolve a range of tactical challenges besetting their forces, it is noteworthy that many of these adaptations are reactive. The role specialisation of infantry has been driven by an inability to train enough troops, not by proactive force design. The acceleration and simplification of fire control has been driven by failing to deliver effective responsive fires early in the war. It thus remains unclear the extent to which these adaptations will become permanent aspects of the Russian military. It is also evident that as an institution the Russian military continues to fail to anticipate new threats. Air defence units, for example, show a growing proficiency against threats over time, but the introduction of any new strike system or tactics on the Ukrainian side usually causes a period of disruption and friendly fire. Most of all it is evident that the Russian military is systematically struggling to coordinate different functions; this can be exploited. The callousness of Russian approaches towards its own personnel continues to ensure that they underperform versus their potential, usually because of poor unit cohesion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The critical capability underpinning the Russian military remains its fires. Here, it is less clear that its approach is sustainable, or that the pace of adaptation is sufficiently fast. Ultimately Russia has used its massive stockpile of ammunition in a highly inefficient manner and is exceeding its manufacturing rate as regards both shells and barrels. Firepower has been employed by the Russian military as a crutch to compensate for its tactical shortcomings in other areas. If the weight of salvo the Russian military can generate diminishes then it is not at all clear that Russia’s infantry can effectively hold ground. Perhaps the greatest danger for Ukraine, therefore, as regards the longer term trajectory of Russian forces, is if another country provides tooling and workers to establish additional production capacity in Russia for munitions and barrels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian troops, while superior in their morale and often in their training, continue to face a range of hard military tactical challenges in reclaiming their country’s territory. Overcoming these challenges requires sustained and appropriately targeted support from their international partners that reflects the evolution of the tactical situation. Overcoming Russian forces will also increasingly depend upon the tactical proficiency of Ukrainian training, force generation, and equipment maintenance, rather than on the introduction of additional systems. The complexity of Russian fortifications requires Ukraine to undertake a multifaceted process of shaping, breaching and exploitation demanding the preparation of its units and a range of complex capabilities. It is vital that Ukraine’s partners prioritise establishing a sustainable process for individual, collective and staff training to the AFU. Ukraine, today, has the initiative. But as the Russian military adapts, there can be no room for complacency.&lt;/p&gt;

As Saudi Arabia, the UAE and other Arab states normalise their relations with Damascus and welcome the Syrian strongman to his first Arab League summit in 13 years, Syria is no longer the regional pariah it once was – to the West’s dismay.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syria, ravaged by a 12-year civil war and divided by a constellation of foreign forces, economic mismanagement, population displacement and political stalemate, has been pushed to the bottom of the international community’s agenda. The West, while strongly opposed to Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad’s rehabilitation, has nonetheless become comfortable with the status-quo ante that has governed Syrian affairs since the collapse of the Islamic State’s territorial caliphate in 2019. Whereas the US was an early backer of the armed rebellion against Assad’s government, Washington now treats Syria as a counterterrorism problem. On 17 April, US special forces killed senior Islamic State leader Abd al-Hadi Mahmud al-Haji Ali during a helicopter raid in the northeast – just one of the dozens of counterterrorism operations the US has conducted in Syria this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syria’s Arab neighbours, however, don’t have the luxury of ignoring what happens in the country or typecasting it as a security problem. In part due to the facts on the ground, the majority of the Arab world has slowly come to the realisation that perpetual isolation of the Syrian government is neither a wise nor a particularly effective policy. Even the Assad regime’s foremost opponents, most notably Saudi Arabia, have concluded that mending ties with Damascus – at least to an extent – holds a better chance of eliciting Assad’s cooperation on issues of mutual interest than a wholesale policy of pressure. The imperative to move in the direction of normalisation has only increased since the February earthquake in Turkey and northern Syria, which claimed the lives of tens of thousands of people. As Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan remarked during the Munich Security Conference shortly after the earthquake, “in the Arab world there is a consensus growing that the status quo is not workable”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-arab-world-moves-on-from-syrias-war&quot;&gt;The Arab World Moves on from Syria’s War&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even before the Saudi foreign minister’s comments, Middle Eastern governments were busy exploring whether a détente with Syria was possible – not necessarily because they approved of Assad personally or believed he could be turned into a reliable partner, but because the years-long policy of using diplomatic isolation and economic pressure to coerce Damascus into political reforms had few if any accomplishments to show for it. The UAE re-opened its embassy in Damascus in December 2018 after a six-year hiatus, a move quickly followed up by Bahrain. Jordan, Syria’s neighbour to the south, re-opened a major border crossing in 2018 after Syrian government forces wrested back control of the southern city of Daraa (the cradle of the anti-Assad revolution); the crossing’s closure had had significant economic ramifications for Jordanian businesses based in the border city of al-Ramtha, reportedly resulting in over 80% of stores shutting their doors due to a steep drop in commerce. Iraq, which viewed the anti-Assad rebellion warily, ended restrictions at the crossing between the Iraqi city of Albu Kamel and the Syrian city of Al-Qaim in September 2019, despite external pressure on then-Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdel Mehdi to keep the area shuttered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The diplomatic movement between Syria and its Arab neighbours has been even more dramatic than the economic front. In October 2021, Jordan’s King Abdullah accepted a phone call from Assad for the first time since the civil war began a decade earlier. The call was significant less for its substance than for the fact that it occurred at all; Abdullah was one of the first Arab leaders to call for Assad’s resignation after the Syrian army was placed on a war-footing and began utilising tanks and aircraft against peaceful anti-government demonstrations. The UAE, which eyed the growth and consolidation of Iranian influence in Syria warily, made a concerted decision years earlier to reach out to Assad in the hopes of coaxing him away from Tehran. UAE Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed flew to Damascus to meet with Assad in November 2021, the most senior Emirati official to do so at the time. Assad has visited the UAE twice since then, most recently in March 2023, when he held meetings with UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed and was given state honours, which included Assad’s plane receiving an escort by Emirati fighter aircraft. The Egyptians, meanwhile, welcomed Syrian Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad to Cairo in April 2023, the first such trip since 2011 and yet another sign that regional players were becoming more interested in putting relations with Damascus on a less adversarial footing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most consequential shift, however, involves Saudi Arabia, one of the biggest backers of the anti-Assad insurgency during the civil war’s deadliest years. No policy change moves quickly in Riyadh, but it appears as if Syria policy is an exception. In March 2023, the same month Saudi Arabia and Iran agreed to resume diplomatic relations after a seven-year freeze, the Saudis announced that a similar effort was ongoing with the Syrian government. The bid was likely accelerated due to the February earthquake, which prompted Riyadh to dispatch planes carrying humanitarian assistance to Syrian government-controlled airports. Saudi Arabia and Syria arrived at an agreement in April to resume consular services in one another’s countries and to restore direct flights. To underscore the point, Syrian Foreign Minister Mekdad flew to Saudi Arabia on 12 April, the first trip by a Syrian official to the kingdom in more than a decade; Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal returned the favour with his own trip to Damascus six days later. On 9 May, Saudi Arabia and Syria officially confirmed the mutual re-opening of diplomatic facilities in one another’s countries; days earlier, the Arab League agreed by consensus to re-admit Syria after a suspension of nearly 12 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In part due to the facts on the ground, the majority of the Arab world has slowly come to the realisation that perpetual isolation of the Syrian government is neither a wise nor a particularly effective policy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reasons for the Arab world’s outreach to Syria vary depending on the specific country involved, although a healthy dose of realism can explain much of the momentum. There is a general recognition in the region that while Assad is a weak head of state governing a country split between US and Kurdish forces in the northeast, Turkish forces in the north and northwest and pro-Syrian militias at key border crossing points, he nevertheless controls most of Syria’s population centres, airports and highways and all of its ports. There is no notable opposition within the Syrian government to Assad’s continued rule, or at least not enough to warrant a threat to his position, and whatever political opposition that exists on the outside doesn’t have a strong constituency within the Syrian public at large. Assad retains strong military, economic and political support from his benefactors in Iran and Russia, and despite the Russian military’s formidable challenges in Ukraine, Assad’s state visit to Moscow in March suggests Russian President Vladimir Putin isn’t going to cut off that support anytime soon – saving Assad from being overthrown and solidifying the Syrian government’s position has been a significant Russian foreign policy achievement in the Middle East. Armed opposition to Assad still exists, but it’s limited to a jihadist faction hemmed into the north-western Syrian province of Idlib and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in the northeast, which have expressed a desire for their own talks with Damascus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jordan and Saudi Arabia have even more of an incentive to end frosty relations with Damascus. Both countries are primary markets for the illegal captagon trade that is booming inside Syria. The Saudi and Jordanian security forces don’t have the capacity to tackle this scourge on their own and have concluded that the Syrian government needs to be brought in as a partner if they are to have any chance of stemming the drug’s flow. The fact that the Syrian security forces are directly involved in the production and distribution of captagon is either brushed aside or ignored. Assad has in effect created yet another regional problem that only he can solve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-wests-view-of-the-syria-rapprochement&quot;&gt;The West’s View of the Syria Rapprochement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US, the UK and the EU remain staunchly opposed to any reconciliation with Assad, a man who has committed unspeakable acts during the course of Syria’s civil war, including but not limited to the use of chemical weapons in highly populated areas to quash the insurgency against his rule. The collective Western position is one of begrudging acceptance: while Assad will continue to serve as Syria’s president for a long time to come, it would be a fundamental mistake to reward him for shooting, bombing, gassing and starving his way to victory. In Washington, any hint of normalisation with a war criminal is a political non-starter, particularly in the US Congress, which was the principal force behind the comprehensive Caesar Act sanctions regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the latest regional developments, the Biden administration’s position hasn’t changed. The White House is adamant that while cross-border aid flows will continue in cooperation with the UN, diplomatic recognition and reconstruction assistance are off the table until Damascus satisfies a list of demands, most crucially UN Security Council Resolution 2254, which calls for a “Syrian-led political process” leading to the formation of a new constitution on the road to free and fair elections. The US Congress is even more hard-line than the White House; a bill mandating additional sanctions on the Syrian government and prohibiting any US funds from being used in a way that implies US normalisation of Assad’s government quickly cleared the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Even so, it’s highly unlikely that Biden administration officials and US lawmakers believe demands on political reform will ever be met. Given the facts on the ground and dwindling support for the Syrian opposition from even its traditional backers, Assad has no incentive to negotiate a political transition, which he sees as an unnecessary concession to Syrians he views unapologetically as traitors who deserve no reprieve, let alone a stake in the Syrian power structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Biden administration would prefer not to sanction partners like Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the UAE for investing in Syria or financing its reconstruction, but such sanctions may be inevitable given US law&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe has largely followed the US lead on the Syria file. Indeed, the EU’s Syria policy is almost identical to Washington’s. “There will be no end to sanctions, no normalisations and no support for reconstruction until a political transition is underway”, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell told the European Parliament in March 2021. This position was ratified again in January 2022 by the EU Foreign Affairs Committee. One year later, during a UN Security Council debate on Syria, the French delegation reiterated the EU’s general stance: “Any shift in French and European positions regarding the lifting of sanctions, normalisation and reconstruction is conditional upon the regime’s commitment to a credible and inclusive political process”. Upon learning of Syria’s re-entry into the Arab League, UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly emphasised London’s disapproval of the move: “we cannot just wish away the actions of the Assad regime over the last few years; the brutality against Syrian people cannot just be ignored. And the UK certainly won’t brush that under the carpet”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-west-and-the-arab-world-at-a-crossroads&quot;&gt;The West and the Arab World at a Crossroads&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With respect to Syria policy, the West and its partners in the Middle East are increasingly singing from a different song sheet. The former wishes to preserve and build upon the economic sanctions regime that was established years ago, with the expectation that a lack of foreign investment and reconstruction assistance will over time compel Assad to seriously re-engage with the UN-facilitated dialogue process. The latter, with different priorities and interests at play, want to distance themselves from an approach that relegates Syria to the status of an international outcast until an unlikely democratic system emerges. This juxtaposition was on display during US Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s 2 May call with Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, in which he advised Cairo that “those engaging with the Assad regime should weigh carefully how those efforts are addressing the needs of the Syrian people”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caught in the middle of the two poles are the Syrian people. More than 12 million, or 55 percent of Syria’s population, are food insecure. An astounding 90% of Syrians are living below the poverty line. More than 14 million have fled their homes since the outbreak of conflict in 2011 – nearly 7 million of whom remain internally displaced despite fighting between Syrian government and opposition forces plummeting since 2020, when Turkey and Russia backed a ceasefire in the Idlib region that largely froze the fighting. Estimates of Syria’s reconstruction costs vary but are usually pegged in the hundreds of billions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managing these differences will only become more difficult as the divergence in policy between the West and Syria’s Arab neighbours grows wider. The Biden administration would prefer not to sanction partners like Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the UAE for investing in Syria or financing its reconstruction, but such sanctions may be inevitable given US law. The Caesar Act states that the president “shall impose” financial penalties on any foreign person who “knowingly provides significant financial, material or technological support to, or knowingly engages in a significant transaction with” the Syrian government or an entity owned or controlled by it. The Syrian government’s extensive involvement in the Syrian economy means that any financial assistance would presumably incur repercussions from Washington. The US sanctions regime is likely to deter any large-scale foreign investment in Syria for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, investment from the Gulf states cannot be entirely excluded over the long term, particularly if economic activity is crucial to making diplomatic rapprochement with Damascus a success. In such a contingency, the West will have to determine if sanctions are appropriate – and if so, whether the costs of a breach with partners in the Gulf are worth the benefit of sticking to principle. Over time, the US and Europe could discover that maintaining a stringent sanctions regime on Syria in perpetuity, on behalf of wholly unrealistic goals, is an unsustainable or unnecessary obstacle in pursuit of its wider objectives in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

This report examines cybersecurity in Ukraine, with a look to the larger debate around cyber capabilities and defense.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMES A. LEWIS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most networks can be breached, and most software has exploitable flaws. This can give unparalleled advantage to attackers, but the situation in Ukraine suggests that an energetic and thorough defense can prove more than adequate in matching this advantage. The Ukraine experience can guide decisions on cyber defense, and it suggests that adequate cyber defense will require different approaches, involve new actors, and be complex for nations to construct and coordinate. As part of the UK National Cyber Security Centre’s efforts to shape debate and discussion around cybersecurity issues, this collection of essays examines the war in Ukraine, with a view to the wider debate around the role and value of cyber capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “information space” is one of the key spaces in this conflict. Both sides have vied to shape public narratives and international opinion. Much has been written about the West’s use of the rapid declassification of strategic intelligence to counter and debunk Russian lies about actions in Ukraine. Similarly, much debate amongst academics and commentators has sought to understand whether or not the world is witnessing “cyber war” in Ukraine, or whether and how cyber operations add value to furthering a state’s strategic objectives. Originally, this discussion had a focus on cyber’s offensive utility. The following essays shift the focus toward the use of cyber capabilities for defensive or protective purposes and look at the Ukraine conflict through the lens of cyber defense to identify critical lessons from Ukraine on the construction of cyber resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Serious thinking about cyber defense has largely transitioned from giving deterrence a central place in defensive strategies to focusing on the concept of resilience. Democracies cannot expect to deter adversaries from attempting to use cyber operations to advance their national objectives. This leads to the conclusion, discussed in all of the essays, that the goal for national policy must be cyber resilience: the ability to minimize disruption to critical data and services. Advocating for deterrence still serves a political purpose by signaling a desire to avoid conflict, but it is no longer the foundation of national cyber defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good example of this is the new national cyber strategy published in March by the United States. The strategy never uses the word “deterrence” because, in the view of those responsible for its drafting, deterrence had failed routinely in cyberspace. Deterrence assumes that an adversary can be dissuaded from action; resilience assumes that adversary cyber action is inevitable. This has led to the conclusion that resilience is a better approach to cyber defense, particularly against a range of adversaries we confront, which includes not only states but also criminals and proxy forces. In this sense, cyber resilience protects against a much wider — and future — set of threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These essays explore different aspects of defense and resilience — including the actors that contribute to it — and identify lessons that Western countries can draw from the Ukrainian experience to build robust, collective cyber resilience. This includes the power of partnerships, whether in responding to cyberattacks or ensuring the continuation of vital services amidst conflict, and the unprecedented coalition of government, multinational, industry, and civil society actors whose efforts have enabled a stronger Ukrainian defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that the most important aspect of resilience is only discussed indirectly in the essays: the need for political and social resilience. Lonergan, for example, notes that the political implications of cyber actions have proven to be more important than their military effect. One of Putin’s many miscalculations was the belief that Ukrainian defenses would quickly crumble. A Russian analyst (now in exile) suggests the precedent of Afghanistan as shaping Russian expectations, since in that case a well-equipped and Western-trained army evaporated in a matter of a few weeks. Putin may have expected Kyiv to react like Kabul. However, Ukraine’s leaders and people were not ready to concede to Russian suzerainty. The keystone of resilience is the political will to continue to resist. While it can be an elusive term, this political will forms the basis for diplomacy and defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The essays point out that the Ukraine conflict demonstrates that political resilience must be strengthened in cyberspace, by attention to both the digital technologies that create the information space messages and the content itself. This is not only because of the struggles over the narratives that shape opinion (and thus political will), nor solely because of the possibility of disrupting critical infrastructure, but also because cyber actions provide the tools and the structure to build a resilient community for defense — a community, as the authors note, that has transcended the boundaries of Ukraine and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is more to cyber resilience than political will, of course (although without political will other actions are superfluous) — people, technology, organization, planning. Nor can cyber resilience be thought of as solely the remit of government. Indeed, what the Ukraine conflict has demonstrated is the broad, diverse range of actors participating in a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more diverse set of participants in the conflict raises questions of how it is that the roles and responsibilities within cyberspace are understood, as well as what the norms and rules are that dictate how actors conduct themselves. Ukraine has demonstrated the value of coalitions in cyberspace, and of collective defense, including robust and distributed data and network architectures. Partnerships with civil society, the private sector, and other governments are crucial. Organizing this multi-party effort requires an ability to connect and communicate with all actors, and this requires reinforcing established channels for media and official communications with the use of distributed and decentralized messaging services, like Signal and Telegram. All of the essays explore the new digital landscape where cyber conflict will occur and which nations must defend: a landscape created by fiber optic networks, mobile telephony, the “cloud,” and satellites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The essays draw several lessons from the Ukrainian experience. The first is that many cyber strategies, in light of that experience, can now be seen to be incomplete or inadequate in their definitions of what is critical for defense. A second is the need to establish deep relations with allied and partner nations for sharing intelligence, technology, and tactics. Ukraine had an advantage in that its cyber conflict with Russia began in 2014, allowing government agencies to develop greater collaboration in responses and Ukraine to build mature relationships with allies. Similarly, establishing relations with global service providers and civil society on an ongoing basis is critical. The ability to use resources and support from the private sector and civil society gave Ukraine an advantage in defense that Russia was unable to match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors recognize the need to exercise a degree of caution in drawing on the Ukrainian experience. Russia’s military proved to be startlingly incompetent; future opponents may not be similarly afflicted. Russia’s brutal and unprovoked invasion created a wave of sympathy and support among democracies and civil society. Other conflicts, where moral and ethical distinctions are not as stark, may not produce the same response. One task for national cyber agencies is to build now the supportive relationships with nongovernmental actors that are needed for conflict: both the constant ongoing low-level conflict that defines cyberspace and the eventuality of a conflict that crosses the threshold of the use of force, something that seems much closer than it did a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The essays included in this collection predict that many different categories of actors will be enmeshed in future cyber conflict. This aspect of the Ukraine conflict provoked a confusing discussion in the broader cybersecurity literature on the legality of using proxies and the implications for the global norms on responsible state behavior in cyberspace that were agreed upon at the United Nations. Frankly, this debate seems to be based on misunderstanding. The UN discussions made it clear that the agreed norms do not apply during armed conflict — which is the sphere of different norms and laws, in particular the Laws of Armed Conflict (LOAC). There are ambiguities, of course, created by the nature of cyberspace when nations attempt to apply LOAC, given that distinctions among participants and targets that can be clear in the physical world are opaque in cyberspace, but the authors discuss whether the use of proxies and militias has become a normal and (if done in accordance with LOAC) legal part of warfare and most likely an element of any cyber conflict in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The essays raise these points in greater detail and clarity. Lonergan’s discussion of proxies makes the important point that while there is little evidence of effect from “hacktivism” on opponent decisionmaking or military capabilities, there is strong evidence that the primary effect is political and international — to build a community of support and to shape the narrative of the conflict for national and international audiences. The proxy actors’ apparent relationship with the “sponsoring” state is a key determinant of this, combined with a greater international orientation to shape the narratives of the conflict, and a focus solely on cyber effects may miss the most important impact created by proxies. Lonergan criticizes the tendency among policymakers and media to default to hyperbolic language to depict the effect of proxies, regardless of their true impact — noting that hyperbolic rhetoric about cyber proxies only reinforces their narratives and becomes a tool to rally their constituencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Voo’s essay notes that the internet has become a political battleground and that Ukraine offers important strategic lessons for the key foundations of successful cyber defense. She asks fundamental questions of whether the responsibility for defense lies in the voluntary actions of tech companies or whether special rules for social media, dual-use technology, and the participation of volunteers are needed in periods of conflict. She emphasizes the need for organization and the importance of integrating cyber defense strategies into a country’s wider military and intelligence strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She and Ertan both note that private sector actions are not driven solely by altruism, since Russia’s cyber actions harm the space in which they do business, and there is only an ad hoc business model for private sector actions. Voo asks what has become the central question for international cybersecurity: whether consequences are needed for norms to have any meaning. Ertan suggests that countries may need to develop (individual or collective) funding mechanisms to remedy this with suggestions for remodeling cyber resilience from a NATO allies perspective. She also makes the critical point that “cyber war” is a flawed concept, since most adversary action remains below the use-of-force threshold. The increasing ease with which authoritarian states use cyberspace to undermine a rules-based order creates an uneasy space that is marked by conflict rather than peace. Garson also points to early misunderstandings of the complexity and limitations of cyber operations that confused expectations for the Ukraine war. She explores the sheer depth of the private sector’s involvement in cyberspace, along with the complexity this creates for companies as they seek to navigate engagement and risks within complex geopolitical crises — as well as the implications that the private sectors’ actions hold for long-term stability in cyberspace, as the lines between defensive and offensive activity become increasingly blurred in conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These brief synopses do not do justice to the essays, and indeed barely touch upon many of their most salient points. There are also the caveats that the conflict has not ended and that the full details have not emerged. But with these caveats, the essays provide a deeper understanding of the use of cyber operations in the war — and how democratic countries should, in light of this, prepare their cyber defenses and resilience, whether within or outside of a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;introduction-1&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the lead-up to Russia’s invasion in February 2022, much of the expert commentary within the cyber community about the Ukraine conflict focused on three things: the extent to which Russia would launch a cyber “shock and awe” campaign to coerce Ukraine into submission; fears of a Russian cyber onslaught against the United States, the United Kingdom, and Europe to deter Western intervention or retaliate against economic sanctions; and speculation about the degree to which Russia would effectively integrate cyber and kinetic operations on the modern battlefield. Yet, after more than one year of war, none of these issues has been a defining feature of the cyber dimension of the conflict in the way that most analysts expected. Instead, one of the most significant cyber features of the war has been the role of third-party actors as belligerents — cyber proxies — aligned to Russia or Ukraine. While the concept of cyber proxies is not novel, it has taken new and evolving characteristics in the context of the Ukraine conflict, offering a potential preview of how cyber proxies may play a role in future crises and conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, an important feature of cyber proxies in the Ukraine conflict is their willingness to conduct cyberattacks beyond the theater of operations, including against the United States, the United Kingdom, and Europe. While policymakers issued warnings about potential Russian cyberattacks that might spill over beyond Ukraine, they did not necessarily anticipate the form in which they would ultimately occur — specifically, low-impact, disruptive cyber activity carried out by hacktivist groups. For instance, in late January 2022, the National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) in the United Kingdom cautioned that Russia was likely to target the private sector via cyber means and advised companies to “bolster their cyber security resilience in response to the malicious cyber incidents in and around Ukraine.” And in February 2022, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued a stark warning to private companies that Russia has “used cyber as a key component of [its] force projection over the last decade . . . The Russians understand that disabling or destroying critical infrastructure — including power and communications — can augment pressure on a country’s government, military, and population and accelerate their acceding to Russian objectives.” However, Russian advanced persistent threat actors have largely avoided conducting major, significant cyberattacks against Western targets. Instead, there has been a significant volume of disruptive cyber activity carried out by proxy actors with far more ambiguous relationships to the Russian government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prevalence of cyber proxy groups was immediately apparent in the opening days of the Ukraine conflict. For example, on February 24, 2022, the Anonymous hacker collective declared via its Twitter account that it was “currently involved in operations against the Russian Federation. Our operations are targeting the Russian government.” Shortly after that, Killnet, which was previously a modest hack-for-hire group, morphed into a politically motivated hacktivist entity and began a sustained effort to conduct low-cost, disruptive cyberattacks against a range of Western targets. Around the same time, the newly established IT Army of Ukraine, a volunteer hacker army that includes individuals from Ukraine and around the world, began to launch attacks against targets within the Russian Federation. In other words, the Ukraine conflict is characterized by a notable resurgence of proxy warfare — but with novel characteristics and permutations. Specifically, many of these cyber proxy groups are operating more as transnational social and political actors — creating platforms for political mobilization and influence — than as traditional proxies conducting cyber effects operations on behalf of a state government for the purposes of coercion or warfighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of the reality that cyber proxies are a consistent feature — not an aberration — of this conflict, governments should anticipate that future wars may give rise to similar patterns. Yet, policymakers seem to be overlooking this aspect of the war, instead focusing more on dissecting the causes of Russia’s apparent underperformance in cyberspace or on emphasizing their own roles in contributing to Ukraine’s cyber defenses. However, because a significant portion of the cyber activity occurring in the context of this war is being perpetrated by different types of cyber proxy actors, it is important for policymakers to assess the implications of the novel ways in which cyber proxies are influencing the Ukraine conflict to better anticipate their roles in future contingencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;traditional-concepts-of-cyber-proxy-warfare&quot;&gt;Traditional Concepts of Cyber Proxy Warfare&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The notion of “proxy war” in cyberspace is not a new phenomenon. Indeed, governments have formed ambiguous, plausibly deniable relationships with a variety of cyber actors — both witting and unwitting — for as many decades as cyber conflict has existed. These actors range from criminal organizations at varying levels of sophistication (such as a ransomware groups); to patriotic hackers or hacktivists; to private firms; and to advanced persistent threat actors with closer, but still plausibly deniable, relationships with governments. Most discussions of cyber proxies focus on the different ways in which states direct (with varying degrees of overtness) or enable non-state actors to conduct cyber operations on behalf of or aligned with the interests of the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has been an especially prolific actor in the cyber proxy realm, leveraging these groups not only for cyber effects operations but also for broader purposes of information and psychological warfare. This is not surprising given the Russian doctrine, which conceptualizes cyberspace and cyber warfare as only one element of a broader “information confrontation.” For example, Moscow has established longstanding relationships with cyber criminal organizations: providing them safe haven, protecting them from prosecution, and turning a blind eye to their criminal activities in exchange for their tacit agreement to avoid targeting Russian interests in cyberspace and to be available when called upon to act on behalf of the government. More recently, Russia has permitted ransomware groups to operate from its territory and conduct costly attacks against Western targets (even if it does not direct or order them to do so), including the spate of ransomware attacks in 2021 against U.S. firms such as Colonial Pipeline and JBS meat processing. Yet, Russia’s tolerance of cyber criminal groups is sometimes tested, such as its announcement in January 2022 that the Federal Security Service (FSB) had dismantled the ransomware group REvil, arresting some of its members and seizing its assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has also leveraged both witting and unwitting cyber proxies to complement its military campaigns. As part of Russia’s 2008 invasion of Georgia, it is likely that the Russian government facilitated the creation of online forums to distribute malware and coordinate cyberattacks against Georgian targets. Cyber proxy groups were also prolific in the context of Russia’s 2014 annexation and occupation of Crimea. For example, in October 2014 the hacktivist group CyberBerkut, which experts suspect has connections to APT28 (the Russian advanced persistent threat actor linked to the GRU, Russian military intelligence), compromised Ukraine’s election systems and posted exfiltrated data online just prior to the parliamentary elections. And in 2015, APT28 carried out the first-known cyberattack against a state’s power grid, disrupting Ukraine’s grid for several hours during the winter. It is likewise notable that Ukrainian patriotic hacker groups were also active during Russia’s 2014 military campaign — such as the Ukrainian Cyber Army, which conducted website defacements and similar types of low-impact attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, states have found working with cyber proxy groups appealing for a range of reasons. The ambiguous and secretive nature of these relationships enables governments to plausibly deny their role in cyber incidents, shielding themselves from potential retaliation by adversaries or from paying political costs in the context of their own domestic politics. In some cases, a government may see benefits in tacitly permitting proxy groups to engage in more aggressive, disruptive, or offensive actions than it would otherwise be willing to conduct directly, or it may permit them to attack certain types of targets that the government might otherwise see as being off limits for its own cyber forces, such as civilian critical infrastructure. Encouraging action by cyber proxy groups can also serve as a means of diverting domestic political or nationalist pressure during international crises, acting as a form of pressure release. Permitting cyber proxies can also keep potential threats to a regime busy: rather than applying their cyber skills against the government, would-be hackers can be directed against both internal rivals and external threats to a regime. Additionally, particularly for less mature cyber powers, proxy groups can provide a much-needed augmentation of a state’s cyber capabilities or skilled personnel. In some cases, highly organized cyber criminal enterprises may be more sophisticated than some nation-state actors. From the perspective of the cyber proxy group, implicit or explicit state support provides a number of benefits. Most importantly, the legal protections offered by states can shield proxy groups from prosecution or even extradition by international law enforcement, enabling groups to carry out their enterprises without scrutiny. Cyber proxies may also perceive gains from resources, technologies, training, and capabilities to which they might otherwise lack access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, there are also risks. In particular, with respect to the state, cyber proxy groups could exceed their mandate, creating risks of blowback or retaliation against the government or increasing the chances of inadvertent escalation. In a different vein, cyber proxies may simply be ineffective, shirk responsibilities, or divert government resources toward their own desired objectives. Finally, cyber proxies could turn against their state sponsor, engaging in cyber activities that directly or indirectly undermine the sponsor’s interests or political stability. Therefore, a core aspect of cyber proxy warfare hinges on the nature of the relationship between the proxy group and the state sponsor. The extent to which a state has effective command and control over the activates of a proxy group — directing it to conduct cyber operations in its interests — or whether it risks both under- and over-performance by a proxy shapes the benefits and risks of working with cyber proxies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;traditional-forms-of-cyber-proxy-behavior-in-ukraine&quot;&gt;Traditional Forms of Cyber Proxy Behavior in Ukraine&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2022 Ukraine conflict has seen a significant amount of this type of traditional cyber proxy behavior — where a state implicitly permits or more directly urges affiliated non-state actors to conduct cyberattacks. In this sense, the current conflict reflects a level of continuity with Russia’s past approaches. One example of traditional cyber proxy warfare is the failed attempt by APT28 on April 8, 2022, to replicate its 2015 success in disrupting Ukraine’s power grid. While ultimately unsuccessful (Ukraine’s Computer Emergency Response Team and a Slovakian cybersecurity firm were able to halt the attack), it appears to have been an effort by Russia to apply cyber power as part of a broader warfighting approach via leveraging traditional proxy groups. Indeed, evidence indicates that the attackers had gained access to the power grid’s system in the first phases of the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukraine conflict has also been characterized by the activation of Russian-aligned hacktivist groups with more ambiguous relationships with Moscow that are likely under much looser command and control structures — similar to Russia’s mobilization of these groups in 2008 in Georgia and 2014 in Crimea. Indeed, many of these groups claim to have no formal affiliation with the Russian government, even as they operate in Russia’s interests. Specifically, these Russian-aligned hacktivist groups have been active in attacking targets of interest within Ukraine, including critical infrastructure, even if the sophistication and severity of their attacks has been minimal. For example, on August 15, 2022, the People’s CyberArmy conducted a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack against a Ukrainian state-owned nuclear power company, Energoatom. The hacktivist group unleashed 7.25 million bot accounts, which flooded the power company’s website with bogus traffic. Nevertheless, Energoatom was able to thwart the DDoS attack within a few hours, and the People’s CyberArmy quickly moved on to other Ukrainian targets. In another illustrative example, on July 1, 2022, XakNet, a Russian-aligned hacktivist group, claimed that it had conducted a cyberattack against DTEK, Ukraine’s largest energy holding company, posting to its Telegram channel screenshots that were meant to serve as proof of its successful breach of the company’s networks. This cyber incident occurred at the same time as Russian missile attacks against DTEK’s Kryvorizka thermal power plant in Kryvyi Rih, although the connection between the cyber and kinetic incidents is likely spurious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;new-forms-of-cyber-proxy-warfare&quot;&gt;New Forms of Cyber Proxy Warfare&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the Ukraine conflict is revealing new permutations of cyber proxy warfare that are more internationalized, just as the broader conventional conflict itself has drawn in multiple external participants. Specifically, a significant portion of the cyber activity that is taking place in the political context of the Ukraine conflict is being carried out by hacktivist groups that are attacking targets beyond the theater of operations — either within the Russian homeland or against targets in the West, especially the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO) member states. Moreover, these groups are drawing on participants from around the world who are aligned to their political orientation, even if they may lack the level of skill and sophistication of other threat actors, such as APT28, that are more directly aligned with governments. Examining just two different examples of these types of cyber proxy actors — Killnet and the Ukraine IT Army — reveals some of the similarities as well as the variation across these groups and how they are changing the nature of cyber proxy warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, while these two groups express diametrically opposed political orientations and differ in the extent of their affiliation with a government (the Ukraine IT Army was initially created by a government official, while Killnet claims to be independent of Moscow), they are primarily focused on conducting disruptive or nuisance cyber campaigns against targets beyond the battlefield in Ukraine. Additionally, both cyber proxy groups maintain active social media forums where they provide direction to their members about planning and executing cyberattacks. But these forums also serve to communicate political messages and act as a form of virtual political mobilization, rallying cadre around a cause and shaping the narrative of the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is this combination of more internationally-oriented membership and targeting, coupled with the use of cyberattacks as a vehicle for political mobilization, that makes this form of cyber proxy warfare particularly interesting and novel in a warfighting context. In this sense, these cyber proxies act as both transnational and local actors — conducting operations beyond the battlefield as a means of cultivating their own internal political narratives, while at the same time shaping broader narratives about the conflict. In other words, these groups are playing a role in the Ukraine war not simply by virtue of how their cyber effects operations are impacting the course of the conflict, or through deterring or coercing external parties. After all, the types of operations these groups conduct are low-cost, disruptive cyberattacks that do not do much in the way of damage. Rather, their cyber campaigns are a way for groups to further political narratives about the war and shape the perceptions of different audiences, and it is through this lens — not that of cyber effects — that their impact can be best understood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;killnet&quot;&gt;Killnet&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Killnet, a Russian-aligned hacktivist group that became active in the initial stages of the conflict, is a formerly small and obscure botnet for hire organization that has since rebranded as an internationally known hacktivist group. Politico has described the group as “more like an angry, nationalist online mob armed with low-grade cyber-offensive tools and tactics,” contrasting it with more sophisticated Russian threat actors. Indeed, Killnet’s adherents are not particularly skilled and the group almost exclusively conducts straightforward DDoS campaigns, publishing simple scripts on its social media channels for followers to use. Yet, Killnet has received a significant amount of attention from analysts and the media due to its near-routine targeting of Western entities, including critical infrastructure. This distinguishes Killnet from other pro-Russia hacktivist groups, which have largely focused on targets within Ukraine, perhaps in coordination or at least alignment with Russian conventional military operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, in early February 2023, Killnet launched a wave of DDoS attacks against more than a dozen hospitals in the United States. But, like many of Killnet’s prior disruptive attacks, the actual impact on U.S. hospitals was minimal. According to Cloudfare, the largest of these attacks peaked for only ten seconds, with the total attack lasting for only six minutes. Similarly, the American Hospital Association stated that the “impact appears to have been minimal and temporary.” This cyber activity is a hallmark of Killnet’s approach: conducting low-impact disruptive cyber campaigns against Western critical infrastructure and other targets. In these types of campaigns, Killnet does not appear to be focused on actually having an impact with its disruptive attacks — or at least does not particularly care if its self-generated bravado matches reality. Despite the negligible effects of its cyber operations, Killnet appears to relish in hyperbolic and triumphalist language to rally supporters around its cyber campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against smaller countries, particularly the Baltic states, Killnet has been more successful in sustaining disruptive attacks over longer periods of time. For example, in May 2022 as part of its declaration of “war” against countries supporting Ukraine, Killnet launched DDoS attacks against dozens of targets in Latvia, a NATO member state, ranging from government and transportation to finance. Accompanying these attacks were calls on Killnet’s Telegram channel and other social media sites for cadre to carry out additional cyberattacks against Latvia. Killnet targeted Latvia again in July with a large disruptive attack — including a 12-hour disruption of Latvia’s public broadcasting center — after the government stated it would take down Soviet-era monuments. August saw another disruptive attack, this time against the website of Latvia’s parliament after the body declared Russia to be a state sponsor of terrorism. All this followed a 10-day wave of DDoS attacks against Lithuania in June in response to that government’s decision to block certain Russian exports. Moreover, these represent only a handful examples of the disruptive attacks conducted by Killnet and similar groups against Latvia and Lithuania which, along with Estonia, are routinely targeted in this manner by cyber proxies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some ways, the bluster may be the point. Specifically, an important aspect of Killnet’s success as an organization derives from its Telegram channel and associated media sites, where members routinely congratulate one another and even leverage Western media reports about their cyberattacks to bolster their credibility internally and improve morale within the group. Killnet’s Telegram channel, which is only in Russian, has over 90 thousand subscribers. Indeed, as Dark Reading reported, Killnet has seen a significant increase in its social media followers stemming from the public nature of its DDoS campaigns (even as they are not causing any meaningful effects): “Killnet’s’ pro-Russian DDoS crusade has also begun attracting many more followers and fans.” Killnet has even become a feature of Russian war-related pop culture. Last summer, Russian rapper Kazhe Oboyma published a song glorifying Killnet called “KillnetFlow (Anonymous diss).” In October 2022, Killnet launched a jewelry collaboration with Russian jeweler HooliganZ, and the group also sells other Killnet-branded merchandise. This “serves as a form of propaganda, helping to recruit new members and promote the group’s cause.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like other Russian-aligned hacktivist groups, Killnet’s leader, Killmilk, staunchly disavows any formal relationship with the Russian government and claims that the group is entirely self-organized and sustaining. Yet, it is clear that Killnet is serving Russia’s broader political purposes in the conflict. The fact that Killnet’s Telegram channel is only published in Russian, for instance (coupled with its attempts to gain a foothold in broader Russian culture), provides insights into the audience the group is interested in mobilizing — domestic Russian or near-abroad Russian speaking audiences. In this sense, Killnet is ostensibly a useful tool of Moscow’s efforts to maintain domestic support around continuing Russian military involvement in Ukraine — while at the same time keeping potential spoilers and discontented would-be cyber actors busy. This aligns with recent research on the use of cyber proxies during international crises, where states have been found to use these actors as a means of placating certain domestic political audiences. While that research was focused on the role these groups play in facilitating the de-escalation of crises, it reflects an important insight that there are domestic political considerations in the use of cyber proxy groups that may be as significant to a government, if not more so, than international ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-it-army-of-ukraine&quot;&gt;The IT Army of Ukraine&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Killnet and the IT Army of Ukraine are on opposite political sides of the conflict and engage vastly different audiences, there are several important similarities between the two groups. This is suggestive of emerging trends in cyber proxy warfare stemming from the Ukraine conflict. Both the IT Army of Ukraine and Killnet have transnational characteristics in terms of the international representation of their volunteers and the scope of their targeting. Specifically, both groups focus their efforts on attacking targets — such as civilian critical infrastructure — outside of the theater of operations in Ukraine. While Killnet largely conducts DDoS attacks against the West, the IT Army of Ukraine has directed its efforts almost exclusively against Russian targets within the Russian Federation (rather than on the battlefield), as well against Belarus. Additionally, both Killnet and the IT Army prefer low-cost, disruptive cyberattacks, likely because this enables wider participation by would-be volunteers, making it easier for sympathetic individuals to join the cause. Finally, both groups leverage social media platforms (albeit in different ways) as part of their efforts to facilitate political mobilization and shape the information narratives around the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, there are also key differences between the groups. One important distinction is the nature of each group’s relationship with government — a core element of cyber proxy warfare. While it is clear that the Russian government benefits from Killnet’s activities, there is no evidence of a formal link between the two. In contrast, while the Ukrainian government has publicly denied any role in the IT Army’s activities, the group was initially created in February 2022 by Ukraine’s deputy prime minister and minister of digital transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov, reportedly at the suggestion of Yegor Aushev, a Ukrainian tech entrepreneur. Moreover, in March 2023, the Ukrainian government announced that it is in the process of developing legislation to formalize the IT Army and incorporate it into the country’s regular armed forces. Additionally, there is far less plausible deniability in the relationship between Kyiv and the IT Army. As Newsweek depicts it, the Ukrainian government “is the first country, certainly the first European democracy, to openly embrace a hacktivist militia during a shooting war.” Similarly, Wired describes the IT Army as “a government-led volunteer unit that’s designed to operate in the middle of a fast-moving war zone.” That said, it is important to note that the idea of a decentralized volunteer cyber citizen militia is not an entirely novel concept in Europe, with the exemplar being the Estonian Defence League’s Cyber Unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, while IT Army maintains that it operates independently of the Ukrainian government (at least until the new legislation is passed), researchers have suggested that the organization is actually segmented into two distinct groups. The first is a large, public-facing, globally engaged network of volunteers who conduct disruptive cyber operations against Russian targets. Notably, however, the size of its membership has been declining over time, estimated to be nearly 300,000 subscribers in February 2022 to just under 200,000 in March 2023. The second element of the IT Army is an “in-house team likely consisting of Ukrainian defense and intelligence personnel that have been experimenting with and conducting ever-more complex cyber operations against specific Russian targets.” This latter component, therefore, embodies a traditional concept of cyber proxy warfare (characterized by plausibly deniable connections between military and intelligence organizations and cyber actors), while the former resembles newer permutations of cyber proxies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the IT Army of Ukraine is far more disciplined than Killnet in terms of its organization and approach, professing to be deliberate in its targeting decisionmaking. For example, in response to a query from a Newsweek reporter, an IT Army spokesperson noted that the group is “focused on causing economic damage to Russia in order to weaken its ability to wage war against Ukraine . . . We do not target ordinary citizens, and we take great care to adhere to the laws of armed conflict.” The group has developed mechanisms for organizing and prioritizing different types of targets, identifying the anticipated level of skill that a given attack demands, and coordinating and deconflicting among different efforts. Its Telegram channel also maintains a routinized tasking process for disruptive attacks, where marching orders are given at the same time each day (0900 Central European Time) and targets are typically organized by a theme (such as food delivery services on a weekend to make everyday life slightly more difficult for Russian citizens — suggesting the IT Army may indeed sometimes target ordinary civilians). Despite this level of organization — ostensibly more so than Killnet — there is little evidence that the IT Army’s disruptive cyberattacks are having any meaningful impact on the Russian government’s decisionmaking or on the Russian population’s support for the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This suggests that, like Killnet, the cyberattacks themselves (and, by extension, their effects) do not represent the primary contribution of the IT Army to the broader conflict. Instead, the IT Army of Ukraine has leveraged social media to create both a local (Ukrainian) and international (largely Western) community of supporters aligned with its cause. The act of collectively conducting relatively simple cyberattacks thus builds and reinforces community, providing something around which to rally and energize supporters. How these two groups use their social media platforms is also suggestive of the different audiences they are aiming to mobilize. Killnet’s Telegram page is focused on shaping the perceptions of Russian-speaking audiences. In contrast, the IT Army’s Telegram page is in both Ukrainian and English, which reflects the Western-oriented audience the group aims to engage. Indeed, while the group’s first Telegram post on February 26, 2022, was in Ukrainian, the second was in English and contained the following message: “For all IT specialists from other countries, we translated tasks in English. Task # 1 We encourage you to use any vectors of cyber and DDoS attacks on these resources.” What followed was a list of Russian targets organized by sector, from “business corporations” like Gazprom and Lukoil, to “banks” such as Sberbank, and to “the state” including the Office of the President, the Ministry of Defense, and others. In this sense, the IT Army of Ukraine is a microcosm of Ukraine’s broader effort to shape the information environment within Ukraine and — importantly — among Western audiences, whose political support is essential for enabling military support to the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;policy-implications&quot;&gt;Policy Implications&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several policy implications follow from this analysis. One clear finding is that future crises and conflict are almost certain to involve a range of cyber proxy actors that are diverse in terms of their level of skill, connection to a central government, and willingness to engage different types of targets. Some of the cyber proxies aligned to the Russian government have conducted (or attempted to conduct) more sophisticated attacks against key targets in Ukraine; others have engaged in low-cost attacks within Ukraine; and still others have conducted disruptive attacks beyond the theater against Western targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some have argued that the proliferation of cyber proxy behavior in the context of the Ukraine conflict has negative implications for international norms about state sponsorship of cyber proxy groups. Western states have sought to promote a norm that states should be held accountable for any cyberattacks that they enable or permit by failing to restrain or turning a blind eye toward proxy groups that emanate from their sovereign borders. Moreover, in the March 2021 final report of the United Nations Open Ended Working Group, nearly all states have agreed to uphold norms of responsible behavior, including norms around preventing the misuse of information and communications technologies. As a result, some have argued that Ukraine’s public support for cyber proxy groups conducting attacks against Russia (such as the IT Army of Ukraine) “stands in stark violation of recently agreed-to norms on state behavior in cyberspace, as well as the foreign policy positions of NATO members and the European Union.” Yet a key challenge with this line of reasoning, as others have pointed out, is that armed conflict represents a fundamentally different context than peacetime or even times of international crisis — one in which “cyber norms should be expected to fall by the wayside before or along with the transition from IHRL [International Human Rights Law] to LOAC [Law of Armed Conflict].” Therefore, policymakers should exercise discretion when considering the normative implications of this conflict and avoid muddying the waters between cyber behavior during wartime versus during routine competition — especially because this may inadvertently undermine important efforts to establish cyber norms where they are actually applicable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, policymakers should not apply a one-size-fits-all approach to these different actors. Traditional policy tools — such as placing diplomatic pressure against state sponsors of cyber proxy groups (like Biden’s warning to Putin in June 2021 at the Geneva summit against permitting groups to conduct cyberattacks against U.S. critical infrastructure) coupled with law enforcement action and disruptive campaigns, may be more effective in addressing traditional cyber proxy actors, especially those over whom a state has more effective command and control. These approaches (likely together with credible threats of retaliation, such as repeated public affirmation that NATO’s Article 5 applies to the cyber domain) appear to have worked in dissuading Russia from directly ordering or enabling more advanced threat actors from conducting major cyberattacks against NATO member states. While speculative, it is plausible that Russia’s decision to dismantle the ransomware group REvil in January 2022 — just one month prior to the invasion — was in part meant as a signal to other groups of Russian control, perhaps to deter them from taking unwanted cyber action or to nudge them fall in line with Moscow’s goals. One potential example of this is the February 25 statement by the Conti ransomware group on its Dark Web site that it was “officially announcing a full support of Russian government” and would respond to any “war activities against Russia.” This is notable because, previously, Conti was not a politically motivated actor and was instead decidedly focused on cyber crime for financial gain. Indeed, the group’s decision to become political caused an internal rift and likely motivated a significant leak of internal documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is unlikely that these traditional tools will be as effective against groups such as Killnet that have a more indirect relationship with central government and that draw on a more international base of support. These groups are likely to be less dependent on the safe haven provided by a government (especially because their lack of sophisticated infrastructure, reliance on open-source tools, and global membership make them relatively easy and low-cost to dis- and reassemble). This means that applying traditional levers to shape the behavior of these groups through putting pressure on state sponsors is a fruitless endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the impact new cyber proxy actors are having on the Ukraine conflict — more in terms of shaping political mobilization and cultivating or reinforcing narratives about the war, and less in terms of the actual effects of their cyber operations — complicates how policymakers are typically inclined to address these groups. In some ways, from a policy perspective, it is more straightforward to focus on thwarting, mitigating, or improving resilience against cyber effects operations than it is to counter political narratives or offer credible competing ones. Yet how these cyber proxies are shaping the conflict is more akin to political warfare than coercion. This relates to a broader challenge Western policymakers are facing in the context of the Ukraine war — namely, that while advanced liberal democracies are largely united and have remained more cohesive than expected in pushing back against Russian aggression, a significant part of the world is either Russian-sympathetic (such as China) or non-aligned (such as India). Of course, cyber proxy groups like Killnet and the IT Army of Ukraine are only one element of the broader contest to shape the perceptions of different audiences. Nevertheless, in evaluating the impact of these groups (and, by extension, applying policies to address them) through the lens of “hackers for hire,” policymakers are missing their real role in the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there is a tendency among policymakers and media to default to hyperbolic language when depicting the workings of various cyber threat actor groups, regardless of their true stature. But blustery rhetoric about these cyber proxy groups only plays into their narrative, which groups in turn use as a tool to further rally their constituencies. Therefore, policymakers should take care to avoid inadvertently playing into groups’ political narratives and providing fodder that enables them to increase their own visibility within their audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the recent announcement that the IT Army of Ukraine may be absorbed into Ukraine’s armed forces suggests broader implications for cyber defense and resilience. The head of Ukraine’s National Coordination Center for Cybersecurity, Nataliya Tkachuk, shared with Newsweek that the government was motivated to formalize the IT Army so that the group would, “become the basis for building the state’s cyber defense capabilities, engaging cyber volunteers in these activities, and creating a cyber reserve.” The IT Army appears to support this effort, commenting that, “We fully trust the efforts of the working group to legalize a massive fight in the cyber sector and welcome the moment when it will stop being the grey zone. We . . . believe that the integration of the IT Army into the cyber reserve will help in building a more effective defense against cyber threats.” This transition is likely unprecedented. There are no known examples of an informal hacktivist group becoming incorporated into a state’s regular armed forces. However, other states have employed volunteer models for cyber defense. Estonia, for example, has pioneered one approach to leveraging volunteer cyber defenders through its Estonian Cyber Defence League — which itself was created in response to Russia’s cyberattacks against the country in 2007. One key issue for Ukraine is how a force that had previously been conducting a largely offensive mission will be able to shift to one focused on defense, both in terms of skills and commitment to a different type of mission. The level of expertise required to carry out low-cost disruptive attacks against Russian-aligned targets is different from that which is necessary to defend domestic networks and systems. Another important question is which elements of the IT Army will transition into regular forces, particularly given the group’s current international composition — as well as the extent to which the government will be able to control the activities of those elements of the IT Army that do not get subsumed under traditional command structures and prevent them from going rogue. Western policymakers should closely follow how this process unfolds in Ukraine, as it could offer important lessons for how governments could better integrate and leverage their own civilian cyber talent to improve cyber defense and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lessons-from-ukraines-cyber-defense-and-implications-for-future-conflict&quot;&gt;Lessons from Ukraine’s Cyber Defense and Implications for Future Conflict&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;JULIA VOO&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;introduction-2&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than a hundred countries reportedly possess the capability to launch state-sponsored cyberattacks. The Russia-Ukraine conflict presents a case study of two capable cyber powers applying their capabilities to achieve national objectives in direct opposition to one another over a sustained period. This conflict has illuminated an eight-year cyber struggle that escalated to include kinetic components last year. With conflicts between states now frequently unfolding in the ambiguous space between peace and war, many national governments should examine Ukraine’s cyber defense as a learning opportunity. Reorganizing to better defend against cyber threats and maximizing capabilities in cyberspace was already a priority for numerous governments before this conflict. While two-thirds of governments worldwide have introduced strategies to defend against threats in cyberspace, more comprehensive measures are needed. The effectiveness of Ukraine’s defense, combined with the high number of countries capable of launching offensive cyber operations, highlights the necessity for the proper structures and relationships to approach cyber defense holistically and effectively. This cyber conflict is notable for how Ukraine — with support from national governments, civil society, and the private sector — conducted a strong cyber defense against a top-tier cyber power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is likely that 2023 will see Russia escalating its cyberattacks against Ukraine, and perhaps NATO partners, to further its objectives. While it is challenging to generalize the lessons from Ukraine’s cyber defense so far, there are several key takeaways that other states should derive from the past year as they face cyberattacks from not only Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russia-ukraine-conflict-and-the-value-of-cyber-defense&quot;&gt;Russia-Ukraine Conflict and the Value of Cyber Defense&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the world had not witnessed a kinetic conflict between two highly capable cyber powers. Contrary to the anticipated crushing defeat many expected Russia to deliver to Ukraine due to Russia’s extensive record as a capable offensive cyber actor, Ukraine has managed to successfully defend its interests while demonstrating the role of cyber capabilities in conventional conflict. Ukraine had been encouraged for years to build its cyber defenses and implement a “whole-of-society” cyber defense. As a result, the lessons from this conflict are challenging to generalize given their specific context, including a pre-existing gray zone conflict and unprecedented resources from international actors and the private sector. Nonetheless, Ukraine’s cyber defense thus far merits reflection by other national governments looking to strengthen their own moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXPERIENCED CYBER DEFENDERS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Russia officially crossed into Ukrainian territory on February 24, 2022, Ukraine has been defending itself from Russian cyberattacks since Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, with attacks escalating ahead of the invasion. Over the past decade, Ukraine’s public, energy, media, financial, business, and nonprofit sectors repeatedly suffered from Russian attacks. In 2015, Russia shut off part of Ukraine’s electricity grid, leaving 230,000 people without power for six hours. In 2017, NotPetya malware deployed by the GRU (Russian military intelligence) targeted hundreds of firms and hospitals worldwide, including Ukraine’s power grid. Russia’s cyber operations since the beginning of the kinetic conflict have ranged from preventing access to basic services to data theft, disinformation, wiper malware, DDoS attacks, phishing emails, and surveillance software. Despite these challenges, Ukraine has managed to marshal its capabilities, resources, and relationships to block and recover from setback after setback in cyberspace. A crucial component of cyber defense is investment in both financial resources and human capital to ensure the recruitment and retention of skilled cybersecurity professionals. The maturity of Ukraine’s security operations and incident response, along with its battle-hardened cyber defenders, is difficult to overlook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOLISTIC NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than two-thirds of countries now have some form of cybersecurity strategy to guide their overall cyber defense. A notable step in Ukraine’s consolidation of its national cyber capabilities was the adoption of its 2016 National Cybersecurity Strategy, which recognized the importance of all stakeholders in strengthening Ukraine’s cyber defense, both inside and outside of government. National governments can increase their cyber resilience in several ways: by introducing laws and regulations on cybercrime and cybersecurity; by implementing technical measures to ensure that expertise is available to enhance cyber resilience; by establishing organizational measures to ensure coordination between government agencies and relevant actors; and by developing capacity through the growth of domestic cybersecurity industries, investments in R&amp;amp;D programs, and skills development. The Ukrainian government sought to enhance collaboration among all government agencies, local authorities, military units, law enforcement, research institutions, and civil society to improve Ukraine’s overall cyber defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most effective cyber defense strategies are integrated into a country’s wider national strategies, including military operations and intelligence gathering. Furthermore, cyber strategies must be continuously updated and adapted to keep up with evolving threats and increase national resilience. Through the experience of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, there were key expansions to Ukraine’s 2021 strategy that involved “a wider range of participants, including business entities, public associations, and individual citizens of Ukraine” in addressing Ukraine’s national cybersecurity system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CENTRALIZATION OF GOVERNMENT CYBER DEFENSES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasingly, national governments are streamlining the various departments responsible for different aspects of cyber operations. There are clear roles within governments for structures such as intelligence agencies, the military, law enforcement, and the foreign service; but for cyber defense, these often separate components need to work in tandem. The 2016 Ukrainian cyber strategy also led to the creation of the National Cybersecurity Coordination Center (NCCC). The NCCC, which brings together aspects of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, supervises and analyzes the state of national cybersecurity, including preparedness for combating cyber threats and detecting and forecasting potential and actual threats. The NCCC also hosts international and interdepartmental training courses. Ukraine’s effective centralization and coordination of its governmental cyber defenses demonstrate that these capabilities need to work seamlessly together to ensure maximum effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALLIES SHARING INTEL AND TECH BEFORE AND DURING CONFLICT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the game-changing aspects of Ukraine’s cyber defense is the international support it received and continues to receive. This support has come in the form of cyber expertise and intelligence from other governments, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, as well as governmental organizations like the European Union and the NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International cyber partnerships and support for Ukraine started well before the February invasion. Since 2014, international partners, including the European Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom, have mobilized resources to enhance Ukraine’s cyber defenses while also boosting their own. The United States and Ukraine hosted the first bilateral cyber dialogue in 2017, which included participants sharing approaches on organizing cybersecurity structures and cyber incident response procedures. Since then, the United States has provided $40 million in cyber capacity development assistance to Ukraine. In 2021, the European Union launched a cyber dialogue with Ukraine to strengthen its resilience and legislation in the area of cybersecurity. In the months leading up to the invasion, cyber experts from U.S. Cyber Command and Ukrainian Cyber Command conducted defensive cyber operations side by side to increase cyber resilience in critical networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allies have continued to strengthen Ukraine’s cyber defense since the beginning of the invasion. For example, the United States and the United Kingdom have provided intelligence briefings on Russian cyber operations, including cyber threat intelligence on potential and ongoing malicious attacks such as Industroyer2 malware, firewalls for defense, and DDoS protection. The U.S. government has also assisted Ukraine with identifying and procuring hardware and software to support network defense. Notably, since the beginning of the conflict, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has supplied technical experts to support essential service providers and offered 6,750 emergency communication devices, including satellite phones and data terminals, to strengthen the resilience of critical infrastructure networks and the government. After Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the European Union deployed a cyber rapid response team to help with threat detection and mitigation and has provided €29 million (roughly $31 million) to increase Ukraine’s cyber and digital resistance. Germany has also earmarked some of its 2023 budget to defend Ukraine against Russian cyberattacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the full extent of Russia’s cyber operations against Ukraine and NATO allies has not been made public due to the secrecy surrounding respective vulnerabilities, information sharing between Ukraine and its allies has been two-way. Senior Ukrainian cyber defenders have also met bilaterally with national governments to learn from each other as the conflict continues. Allies who have sent reinforcements in the form of personnel are in turn provided with expertise to better defend their own national networks against similar attacks. This two-way learning is set to continue, with Ukraine becoming an active participant in NATO’s Cooperative Cyber Defence Center of Excellence in March 2022, which, through knowledge sharing, will result in a strengthening of expertise for the alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PRE-EXISTING PRIVATE SECTOR CYBER DEFENDERS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russia-Ukraine war has involved not only conventional military forces and proxies but also, most notably for Ukraine, technology companies. This is unsurprising, as most of the digital infrastructure in Ukraine is owned and operated by private companies. Moreover, it has long been recognized that a strong partnership between the government and the private sector is needed for robust cyber defenses. The cumulative power of the private sector has enhanced Ukraine’s defensive capabilities, including its ability to recover from attacks, improve its battlefield effectiveness, and enhance its global appeal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The collaboration between the private sector and Ukraine demonstrates an unprecedented case of what is possible when there is an alignment of interests between a country at war and commercial technology companies with significant resources at their disposal and an interest in one side’s victory. It remains unclear whether this is a one-off case or a harbinger for future conflicts, but the implications for policymakers are considerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, Microsoft played a critical role in defending Ukraine against Russian cyberattacks, although it was not the only company to do so by far. In early 2022, Microsoft identified a novel trojan horse wiper malware named FoxBlade, which was aimed at Ukraine’s government ministries and financial institutions. After updating its virus detection systems to block the malicious code, Microsoft contacted Anne Neuberger, the U.S. deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technologies, and established a secure line of communication with cyber officials to help bolster Ukrainian defenses. Since then, Microsoft and others have continued to work with the U.S. government, NATO, and EU cyber officials to communicate any evidence of threat actor activity spreading beyond Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Microsoft has been a significant contributor to Ukraine’s and the wider community’s cyber defense, it is only one of many private sector companies that came to Ukraine’s aid. An important part of the private sector’s contribution to Ukraine is not only the considerable resources received from specific entities but also the collaboration between them to jointly provide Ukraine’s cyber defense. A collective of private sector and civil society organizations has volunteered to deliver and maintain Ukraine’s immediate cyber defense needs since the beginning of Russia’s invasion, forming a “Cyber Defense Assistance Collaborative for Ukraine” (CDACU). This informal group of volunteers leveraged relationships with Ukraine’s NCCC, building on pre-existing trust and rapport, to understand how the private sector could help. The CDACU received requests for assistance ranging from intelligence analysis, advice, and sharing to licenses, tactical services, and coordinated support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BACKING UP CRITICAL DATA OUTSIDE THE ZONE OF CONFLICT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the conflict, Ukrainian government data was concentrated in data servers located within Ukraine as an effect of data-localization policies. However, pragmatism on Ukraine’s part — acknowledging the likelihood of an attack on these servers — combined with assistance from the private sector resulted in Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, and Microsoft migrating the data from Ukraine to servers located outside of the conflict zone to enhance resilience. To defend against attacks that seek to immobilize businesses or data, it is critical to build redundancy not only in networks but also by backing up data outside of the zone of conflict. This protects data servers and facilitates rebuilding the economy at a later date. Currently, there are moves in some countries towards data localization. The example of Ukraine underlines the need to protect the physical components of cyberspace — and, in the likelihood of damage, to move data servers out of harm’s way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HACKTIVISM AND VOLUNTEERS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On February 26, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister and minister of digital transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov officially announced the formation of a volunteer IT Army of Ukraine. There appears to be some coordination from the Ukrainian government, and state officials have clearly encouraged their activities. The creation of this 150,000–200,000-strong volunteer-organized cyber force is unprecedented. The IT Army has affected more than 600 online resources in Russia, including the federal post office and pension fund, online banking, and video conference platforms. Anonymous, a hacking collective, has also declared “cyber war” on Russia and claimed credit for DDoS attacks that took down the official websites of the Kremlin and the Ministry of Defense, as well as hacking Russian state TV channels and posting pro-Ukraine content. While unorthodox, Ukrainian cyber defenses have been bolstered by this volunteer force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;looking-forward-challenges&quot;&gt;Looking Forward: Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE OPEN INTERNET AND INFLUENCE CAMPAIGNS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ongoing conflict provides valuable insights into the nature of warfare across the “splinternet,” where two or more internets are fragmented and governed in differing ways. In this case, Russia has a tightly controlled information space, and Ukraine is part of a more open data space. In Russia’s internet space, the narrative is pro-Russia. China and a few others have aligned their narrative with Russia’s. However, Ukraine’s information space — part of the broader more open internet — has been the target of a stream of influence operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russia-Ukraine conflict has been dubbed “the first TikTok war,” highlighting the role of social media in modern conflicts. Social media has not only been used by warzone citizen journalists but also by people with power and authority. Ukrainian president Zelensky, a former comedian and actor, has effectively used social media to champion the cause of Ukraine and rally international support. Russian state media has also leveraged the same platforms to disseminate fake news and propaganda. Meta, Twitter, Microsoft, Alphabet, and TikTok have all taken steps to remove their content from their platforms. The Biden administration has even taken to briefing TikTok influencers on U.S. strategic goals. While social media companies are instrumental in stemming the flow of propaganda, graphic material, and hate speech, questions remain. Should social media companies be solely responsible for making these decisions during a conflict? Should there be special rules during periods of armed conflict? What bodies could or should be involved in a shared oversight framework for prominent platforms? While policymakers have been grappling with these and similar questions since before the Russia-Ukraine war, the conflagration has made such issues more pressing than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An open internet presents a significant challenge for national governments who support it — not only because they are more vulnerable to malign attempts to influence public opinion, but because it is not possible, nor desired, to control all information flows. Beyond considering the roles and responsibilities of platforms in the face of malign influence campaigns, there is also the question of the psychological defense and resiliency of the individual to these influences. If the convergence between information operations and cyber operations in this conflict is a new norm in cyber warfare, then building societal psychological defense, or the collective ability of society to resist foreign malign influence activities and disinformation, will likely become an institutionalized and extended part of many national cyber defense efforts in societies that intend to maintain a “free and open” internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FUNDING PRIVATE SECTOR ALLIES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of Ukraine, the private sector was willing and able to support its national defense, rapidly influencing the situation on the ground. While the private sector’s efforts have been crucial to Ukraine’s defense, they have also come at a significant cost. Microsoft has spent over $400 million on the conflict and will continue to provide gratis services throughout 2023 to the tune of an additional $100 million. Starlink is providing critical connectivity infrastructure to Ukraine, reportedly costing $20 million a month to maintain. Amazon is backing up the Ukrainian government, critical infrastructure, and university data outside of Ukrainian territory at considerable cost. Many U.S. tech companies have suspended the delivery of products and services to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The behaviors of these tech companies should not be confused with altruism. For example, Microsoft’s business outside of Ukraine could be affected by spillover from the conflict, so it is in its interest to step up and defend against cyberattacks. More broadly, these predominantly U.S. tech companies could face regulatory and social backlash in key markets in the United States and Europe if they were to remain neutral or continue conducting business with Russia. Therefore, certain questions regarding the sustainability of this support remain. For one, how long will firms be willing or able to provide these critical capabilities? While U.S. secretary of defense Lloyd Austin III and UK prime minister Rishi Sunak have committed to support Ukraine for the “long haul,” it is unclear whether this will also extend to supporting the private sector. Further, will private sector companies request government subsidies for their efforts? How will these companies decide which future conflicts to support, in kind or otherwise? And how would their bottom lines be affected by taking a more active NATO-aligned worldview? It is still not clear how long these types of firms will be willing and able to effectively donate these expensive services to Ukraine for the remainder of the conflict, or if this kind of support would be replicable for any other besieged country in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONTROLLING DUAL-USE TECHNOLOGIES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DJI, a consumer commercial drone manufacturer, has inadvertently become an arms dealer in this conflict. Both Russia and Ukraine have utilized commercially available drones, such as the DJI Mavic 3, which costs under $2,000. These affordable drones have extended the range of the Ukrainian army and provided enhanced intelligence and communication capabilities. The Ukrainian army has even transformed some of these hobbyist drones into unmanned kamikaze bombers capable of carrying munitions up to 800 grams and of steering toward Russian targets. While DJI announced it would halt drone sales to both Moscow and Kyiv in response to their use in the conflict, commercial drones can still be sourced from other suppliers. This example of a technology that is commercial first but could be used for defense purposes presents the problem of some dual-use technologies. It also raises the issue of the difficulty for some allies to access equivalent primarily defense technologies and raises questions around how these two issues could be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FUTURE INDUSTRY ADVERSARIES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the large consumer tech companies involved in this conflict are American, with the notable exceptions of Chinese-owned TikTok and DJI. However, it is worth considering an alternative scenario involving a conflict with China; how would we expect commercial Chinese actors to behave in relation to the CCP? What frameworks exist around governing tech companies in case kinetic conflict between technological superpowers (e.g., the United States and China) were to emerge? How could companies that would potentially ally with an adversary behave in such a conflict? How would cyber defenses need to adapt if equivalent consequential technology companies instead supported the adversary? What would happen if a future conflict occurred in an environment where a sympathetic private sector actor did not control various aspects of critical infrastructure?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over 30 countries, representing more than half of the world’s economy, have announced sanctions and export controls targeting Russia due to its military operations in Ukraine. These actions have impacted the development of Russian technology and e-commerce. While sanctions against Russian technology make sense as an attempt to force compliance with international will, it is important to consider the long-term effects of exacerbating the bifurcation in technology stacks, which is largely driven by U.S.-China tensions. While bifurcation will decrease dependency, it is essential to consider the potential consequences of creating a more fragmented global technology landscape in terms of access to resources and allegiances of companies with strong links to adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ACCOUNTABILITY IS NEEDED&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Negotiations at the United Nations created norms on responsible state behavior for the acceptable use of cyber capabilities. UN member states have committed to abide by 11 cyber norms. These norms include interstate cooperation on cybersecurity, preventing the misuse of information and communication technologies in sovereign territory, not damaging critical infrastructure, protecting critical infrastructure, taking steps to ensure supply chain security, and not interfering with emergency response teams. Despite this significant milestone, issues remain, including the lack of accountability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;States are constantly engaging in cyber operations to achieve their national objectives. However, some states exert more restraint than others, with checks and balances in place at the national and international level placing guardrails around their cyber operations — as the United Kingdom has described it, “responsible cyber power.” However, this results in a situation where there is a group of states who are less restrained in their cyber operations (e.g., Russia, China, and Iran), posing significant threats to other states that comply with regulatory frameworks and exercise restraint (e.g., the United Kingdom and the United States). The United States and its allies have made efforts to hold state actors to account for their cyber operations which has manifested in the form of attribution. There are numerous cases of attribution of state actors for hacking attempts and commercial espionage. However, attribution does not appear to deter states from behaving badly. Stronger forms of accountability and consequences need to be developed so that there are consequences for states that do not uphold international norms, which in turn could collectively enhance international cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT PROTECTIONS FOR VOLUNTEERS?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s cyber defense has relied on hundreds of thousands of IT volunteers who have supported cyber operations against the Russian state, but it is not clear to whether they are afforded any protection under international law. According to the International Committee of the Red Cross, examples of participation in hostilities include activities that “directly cause harm to another party, either directly inflicting death, injury or destruction, or by directly harming the enemy’s military operations or capacity . . . interfering electronically with military computer networks and transmitting tactical targeting intelligence for a specific attack.” It is unclear to what extent a cyber operation conducted by a civilian — based in Ukraine or beyond — on Russia’s government, propaganda apparatus, and industrial base would qualify as direct participation, or whether volunteers are covered by international norms as non-state actors. For example, hackers geographically based in some territories, such as the United States or the United Kingdom, joining Ukrainian cyberattacks, could be breaking national law. The involvement of volunteer cyber forces from different geographies thus presents new challenges for international norms and laws designed with states in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are significant ramifications from the conflict in Ukraine for the global cybersecurity community. Significant investment in defense is essential to ensure cyber resilience in the face of evolving threats. While this was clear before Russia’s invasion, it was not obvious that Ukraine’s cyber defense would be as effective as it has been so far. What is clear in Ukraine’s case is that the near-decade of having to defend its national interest in cyberspace — which necessitated collaboration across government and with the whole of Ukrainian society, combined with working with allies and the private sector — has resulted in its strong cyber defense to date. Investing in cyber defense, preparing for hybrid warfare, prioritizing information security, and fostering a culture of cyber awareness throughout society has enhanced its resilience and ability to withstand Russia’s cyber and information campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia will likely remain an acute and persistent threat for many countries in the Western alliance. Therefore, there is a lot that can and should be learned from Ukraine’s experience so far to put cyber defenders on a stronger footing in the face of adversarial threats in cyberspace. Significant questions still remain around whether or not this varied and novel alliance between allies, volunteers, and the private sector in cyberspace can be replicated in another scenario. But what all will note from the Ukrainian case so far is that a good defense is perhaps just as effective as a good offense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MELANIE GARSON&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;introduction-3&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the early days of the Ukraine conflict, pundits globally awaited the first “cyber war.” Building on assumptions of the evolution of warfare in the digital age and Russia’s consistent gray zone cyber activity in Ukraine since 2014, governments and security analysts were anticipating the accompanying cyber “bomb,” and they quickly began to puzzle over the lack of a clear cyber front. Many of these questions stemmed from a fundamental misunderstanding of the complexity of offensive cyber activity, as well as of its limitations in delivering widespread guaranteed impacts in the same way as kinetic activity. However, one year on, the State Service of Special Communication and Information Protection of Ukraine (SSCIIP) reports that cyberattacks on Ukraine continue to escalate from their pre-Christmas levels, with a particular focus on public institutions and civil infrastructure. Global cyber activity has reached some of the highest levels ever observed, heavily concentrated on Ukraine; however, due to the continued efforts of a new collective cyber defense alliance, their ability to further Russia’s kinetic activity has been limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unlikely combination of tech companies, tech platforms, tech workers, hobbyists, and hacktivists that helped Ukraine working alongside governments and international organizations has mounted “arguably the most effective cyber defense in history.” By ensuring that the internet infrastructure is secure and operational, that internet services are accessible, and that information is available and not weaponized, these non-state actors were able to rapidly alter Russia’s military communications strategy. This new cyber defense alliance continues to be able to thwart Russia’s cyber ambitions to impact critical communications pathways and has materially contributed to tipping the balance of power in the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst the rapid integration of these disparate cyber actors at the core of Ukraine’s wartime cyber command can provide many lessons for states in their approach to a more holistic and cooperative cyber defense, the strategy opens up a new set of risks. Bringing in civil society and commercial actors into active cyber combat puts pressure on key laws and norms, including the blurring of defensive and offensive cyber activity and the extent that this legitimizes non-state actors as parties to the conflict — and, by extension, places them as well as states as legitimate targets for retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper explores the role of these new defenders of the digital sphere and draws on the discussions of the roundtable held with representatives of the platforms, infrastructure and content distribution networks, and civil society actors as to provide recommendations for building clarity into the engagement with tech companies and non-state cyber defenders and disrupters when these are thrust onto the frontline of cyber defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-never-ending-consolidated-threat-surface&quot;&gt;The Never-Ending Consolidated Threat Surface&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s vision of offensive cyber sits within a wider approach of “information confrontation” or “information warfare” that encompasses both the network attacks that are at the basis of most Western conceptions of offensive cyber activity and the information operations that usually sit within the U.S. definition of cognitive warfare. This has been reflected in Russian Defence Ministry statements clearly defining a strategy of disruption to both the physical network infrastructure and the information space in order to degrade the societal fabric of an opponent. Compounded by the rise of drone warfare and the multi-domain battlefield, the control of a stable internet source is a key element of strategic success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this conception of cyber, defense must span multiple physical and digital threat surfaces, from the information layer through to the backbone of the internet infrastructure, most of which are out of the control of states. Tech companies are now diversified throughout the internet stack, from the information layer, down through the hardware and device layer, into essential services and access control, and all the way to the backbone infrastructure. Meta owns more kilometers of subsea cables than British Telecom, and Starlink’s mega-constellation of LEO satellites far outpaces that of the United Kingdom and the United States, with 3,236 satellites currently operational.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, the communications infrastructure is being consolidated, with a few companies being able to provide services throughout the internet stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/SHcS3nc.png&quot; alt=&quot;image1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Major Providers: Communications Infrastructure.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.institute.global/insights/geopolitics-and-security/disrupters-and-defenders-what-ukraine-war-has-taught-us-about-power-global-tech-companies&quot;&gt;Pete Furlong and Melanie Garson, Disrupters and Defenders: What the Ukraine War Has Taught Us About the Power of Global Tech Companies (London: Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, 2022)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This consolidation has increased throughout 2022 and into 2023, as companies have added to their assets at all levels of the communications infrastructure. Elon Musk’s purchase of Twitter in October 2022 added a platform to the Space X family, Google Cloud’s acquisition of Mandiant increased its cloud security, and Microsoft’s investment into OpenAI suggests that the trend towards developing representation throughout the internet stack as well as control over new and emerging tech is set to continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With vast amounts of the core communication infrastructure now sitting in the hands of commercial companies, the ability and agility to materially interfere with Russia’s multi-level cyber and information warfare could not be achieved without the active and willing cooperation of tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-front-line-of-commercial-cyber-power&quot;&gt;The Front Line of Commercial Cyber Power&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the tanks had rolled into Ukraine, many of the large tech companies had already started shoring up Ukraine’s cyber defenses alongside governments and the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre for Excellence, most notably Microsoft’s detection of the Foxblade malware attack on February 23, 2022. This marked the escalation of both high-profile and more subtle commercial cyber power taking on the defense of Ukraine and limiting Russia’s actions across the physical and digital components of the communications ecosystem, as well as supporting the dissemination of life-saving real time information and applications for Ukrainians. Russia found itself up against the brightest cyber minds as well as the collective might of the global cyber community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;building-resilient-internet-infrastructure&quot;&gt;Building Resilient Internet Infrastructure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internet “backbone” — the wires, pipes, and servers that keep it operational — is notoriously fragile to both environmental events and deliberate interference. Regaining operational function once it is damaged can often be challenging, such as in Tonga which suffered nearly five weeks of internet outage after its subsea cable was damaged in a volcanic eruption. Similarly, the recent Cyclone Gabrielle in New Zealand and the earthquake in Turkey left vast areas with limited connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Ukraine, human internet traffic dropped as much as 33 percent in the days immediately after the invasion. This was driven by Russia’s encroachment on the routing of data — leaving parts of Ukraine reliant on Russian cables and subject to Russia’s restrictions and limitations — such as the Viasat KA-SAT attack that impacted routers in Ukraine and consistent physical degradation to fiber optic cables and electrical power facilities from targeted bombings. Through the strategic destruction of over 4,000 mobile base stations, thousands of kilometers of fiber optic cable, and 18 Ukrainian radio broadcast towers, Russia has prevented local residents from sharing information or receiving information on humanitarian corridors. Russia also keeps its own soldiers in a media blackout so they cannot question their actions. As Russia physically occupies cities, it also occupies the digital ecosystem, with internet traffic rerouted from Ukrainian networks to Russian ones and Ukrainian internet service providers threatened with the loss of their communication equipment unless they join the Russian networks. A parallel more resilient and operational internet became critical to Ukraine’s ability to counter the Russian offensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starlink’s rapid response to Mykhailo Fedorov’s tweet that saw 500 terminals on the ground in Ukraine within five days, 25 of which were transmitting data within a week, has now been widely confirmed as being determinative in ensuring military and civilian communications. Between mid-March and December 2022, Starlink traffic in Ukraine increased by 1,600 percent. Highly resilient and able to withstand electronic jamming attacks more adeptly than previously anticipated, Starlink’s shoring up of Ukraine’s internet infrastructure has been the lynchpin of basic battlefield communications, from weapons supply arrivals to its more controversial use in drone warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In parallel, internet backbone carriers were withdrawing their service provision in Russia. By March 7, 2022, Cogent and Lumen — two of the world’s largest internet service providers, who had provided transit for Russia’s key national fiber backbone operators including Rostelcom and Transtelcom, its key mobile phone operators, and Russia’s search engine Yandex — stopped providing services. Driven by the possibility that the networks could be used as part of Russia’s offensive cyber activity and concern for its employees, with downstream impacts felt as far as Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Belarus, and Iran, this exit left Russia with the challenge of finding alternative infrastructure provisions to enable its strategic internal and external cyber operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;embedding-internet-security&quot;&gt;Embedding Internet Security&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activities on the Ukraine-Russia cyber front had been bubbling since 2016. However, the increase of malicious cyber activity in the months prior to the physical invasion provided governments and tech companies opportunities to secure the digital domain more effectively than the physical battlefield. The CyberPeace Institute has tracked over 1,408 cyberattacks and operations from across 87 different threat actors related to the Ukraine conflict, and whilst these numbers are significant, they likely still do not capture the full picture of the cybersecurity threat. Cloudflare has reported that in March 2022 application layer attacks in Ukraine rose by 1,300 percent and that between February 2022 and February 2023 an average of 10 percent of all traffic to Ukraine was mitigations of potential attacks. At its high point on October 29, 2022, 39 percent of total traffic to Cloudflare’s Ukrainian customer websites was DDoS attack traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As previously noted, Microsoft’s Threat Intelligence Centre (MSTIC) had been working closely with Ukraine’s government and was able to mitigate the “Foxblade” wiper software on 19 government and critical infrastructure entities across the Ukraine government on the day before the war started. It continued to provide support, identifying and protecting against numerous destructive cyberattacks on nearly 50 Ukrainian agencies and entities as well as over 128 targets including government agencies and nongovernmental agencies in 42 countries. Similarly, Cisco Talos was working closely with the government of Ukraine to respond to the WhisperGate malware in January 2022 and translated their responses into protections for customers across Ukraine. Other companies, such as ESET and Recorded Future, have provided key services, tools, and threat intelligence. Google has also reported its role in countering the 250 percent increase in phishing attacks targeting Ukraine and 300 percent increase targeting NATO countries (as compared to 2020), as well as more destructive attacks in Ukraine than in the previous eight years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Microsoft and AWS were pivotal in securing Ukraine’s public sector infrastructure by facilitating the transfer of its data from physical data centers to the cloud within 10 weeks of the Ukraine government passing an urgent amendment to its data protection law on February 17, 2022, to allow data to be held externally. Microsoft provided $107 million of technology services to facilitate this transition. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister and minister of digital transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov, highlighted the contribution of AWS in migrating key public registers and records to the cloud as “one of the biggest contributions to Ukrainian victory.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while large companies like Google have provided cybersecurity protections for over 150 humanitarian organizations from DDoS attacks through its Project Shield, smaller companies essential to the cybersecurity ecosystem have also thrown their weight into the collective defense of Ukraine’s internet. Cloudflare has been providing internet availability monitoring services to Ukraine’s government, moving secure encryption key data for customers out of at-risk data centers in Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus, and providing free protections for Ukrainian organizations under its Project Galileo. Romanian company BitDefender offered a year’s worth of free cybersecurity assistance to business, government, and private citizens of Ukraine. Similarly, California based Vector AI offered its services free of charge for targets or organizations under attack, and companies such as SentinelOne, Avast, and CrowdStrike offered services or decryptors for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ensuring-internet-accessibility&quot;&gt;Ensuring Internet Accessibility&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of companies controlling the distribution of content (content distribution networks or CDNs) is very small and critical in facilitating internet accessibility. Companies with a very small market share can have a large impact on access to the internet and companies such as Cloudflare — with 80 percent of market share — are in a key position to keep the internet accessible. The role of internet accessibility in countering Russia’s cyber offense is more nuanced than that of ensuring security, as it requires managing compliance with sanctions alongside providing access to the internet to balance Russia’s information warfare. While companies such as Fastly, alongside a number of other web companies, quickly ceased working with Russian-based companies altogether, other CDNs stopped paid services to comply with international sanctions but continued to provide free services. Cloudflare, which had been threatened with Russian shutdowns previously, has taken the position that Russia would celebrate their closure if they were to exit and opted to continue providing free, open, private, and secure internet services to the Russian people to counter Russia’s attempts to raise a digital iron curtain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Virtual Private Network (VPN) providers have continued to counter Russian attempts to separate from the rest of the internet by providing avenues for Russians to stay connected to international media sources. VPN use in Russia reached a peak demand of 2,692 percent above average on March 14, 2022. as access to the open internet became constricted. Canada’s Windscribe publicly committed to providing an extra 30GB of data freely to both sides of the conflict, ensuring that Russians have access to the open internet. ProtonVPN waived all fees from Russian customers on the basis of a “strong moral obligation” to be there and ensure the Russian people have freedom of access to the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;secure-hardware-for-hard-war&quot;&gt;Secure Hardware for Hard War&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The communications hardware and the apps that run on it have also become key determinants in the offense-defense balance. Access to personal communication devices has become key, both for soldiers on the battlefield and civilian threat alerts. Affordable hardware is required for the internet, but the sanctions regime has restricted most providers including Apple, Samsung, Lenovo, HP, AMD, Dell, and Intel from operating in Russia and selling the semiconductors, computers, phones, and server hardware that form the physical end point of the communications system. This also impacts the dual-use hardware that enables critical technologies, such as unmanned drones. Ukraine can rely on diversified sources of communications hardware to enable sophisticated battlefield technologies; however, Russia is buying communications hardware, such as electronic jammers, on Chinese-owned AliExpress. This access to diversified supply of trustworthy and secure hardware, in order to both operate and process the information gathered from drones, has reshaped Ukraine’s ability to continually resist Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;defending-the-information-frontier&quot;&gt;Defending the Information Frontier&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Russia’s cyber strategy heavily rooted in the battle for control of the information domain, it is at this level that tech companies have had to fight some of their hardest battles. Russia’s physical digital occupation strategy — restricting internet access through physical means, such as by rerouting networks — has been accompanied by an equally draconian censorship strategy both inside Russia and in occupied parts of Ukraine. While Russia’s media law punishing “fake news” — which was passed in the early days of the conflict — led to most media companies and platforms being forced to leave Russia, its physical occupation in parts of Ukraine have left Ukrainians without key information sources including Instagram, YouTube, and the messaging app Viber. Google’s search engine was disabled in Donetsk, Luhansk, and Kherson on the claim that it was advocating violence and terrorism against Russians, and Russia claimed to have shut Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube in parts of Zaporizhzhia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The role of tech platforms in balancing information flows and countering Russia’s massive influence operations capacity became critical for both strategic and humanitarian reasons even before the kinetic offensive began. Early signs of the Russian invasion were spotted by open-source researchers monitoring traffic data on Google Maps, requiring Google to disable it in order to protect Ukrainian citizens from detection. And as Russian state-owned media became the driving force of disseminating false content about the invasion, platforms such as Meta, Reddit, TikTok, Alphabet (the parent company of Google and YouTube), Microsoft, Spotify, and Telegram restricted access to RT and Sputnik news in Europe — and in some cases globally — and their apps were banned from app stores. Adobe prevented Russian government-controlled media organizations from accessing its creative and document cloud services to avoid being complicit in the creation of harmful information. Google, YouTube, Twitter, and Meta restricted Russian state-based entities from being able to monetize ads on their platforms, and companies including Snapchat and the Japanese-based company Viber implemented wider bans on displaying ads across their apps. Search engines including DuckDuckGo, Google, and Bing downranked links associated with Russian disinformation. Even Chinese platforms such as Douyin, Weibo, WeChat, and Bilibili undertook a process of blocking accounts spreading information that could put Chinese students in Ukraine at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to counterbalance Russia’s information offensive and recognizing the strategic and humanitarian imperative to secure access to information, commercial tech companies across the ecosystem were quick to facilitate alternative access to information, both for Ukrainians and Russians. Google disrupted over 1,950 instances of Russian information operation on its platforms in 2022, including claims that Ukraine operates biolaboratories for generating biological weapons and information operations linked to destructive malware attacks. Microsoft’s Russian Propaganda Index run by its AI for Good Lab also recorded significant increases in traffic to Russian propaganda websites from January 2022, with a rise of 216 percent in the last week of February 2022. Through identifying the scope of the disinformation globally, tech companies enabled governments, companies, and other organizations to implement counter-responses and neutralize the disinformation strategies. Google’s Trust &amp;amp; Safety team has disabled accounts associated with coordinated information operations, including the disruption of YouTube channels, blogs, and AdSense accounts, and has removed domains from Google News surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tech companies have also sought to balance this by providing alternate sources for legitimate information to the Russian people. Twitter launched a parallel site on the dark web alongside its shadow-banning of Russian government accounts. Media outlets have taken advantage of the increased Telegram use to create new sources of news distribution, and Microsoft’s Skype extended free communication in and out of Ukraine. Cumulatively, these rapid and far-reaching actions have restrained the impact of Russia’s digital information blockade, as a strategic tool to facilitate both the active conflict and its supporting actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;private-companies-in-the-trenches&quot;&gt;Private Companies in the Trenches&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behind the tech companies, however, there is another cadre of private actors and companies in the trenches of the cyber elements of the conflict. The cyber defense ecosystem also relies on a complex web of ethical hackers, or “cybersecurity researchers,” who report vulnerabilities to companies and governments. Prior to the conflict, ethical hacking was illegal in Ukraine, with fines for those found detecting bugs in state computers. In early February 2022, however, in the face of mounting cyberattacks, the Ukraine government committed to decriminalize bug bounties to allow for better detection of security vulnerabilities. At the outset of the war, homegrown cybersecurity companies such as Cyber Unit Technologies approached the government to offer their help, forming the basis of Mykhailo Fedorov’s 150,000–200,000-strong IT Army. Hacken.io, the Kyiv-based bug bounty platform, also launched a “Cyber Army” to encourage security researchers on its platform to search for vulnerabilities in Russian websites to be used by the government. Similarly, the Estonia-based bug bounty platform HackenProof invited disclosure of critical vulnerabilities in both Ukrainian and Russian infrastructure, with commitment to disclose them to the Ukrainian authorities for both defensive and offensive use. U.S.-based cybersecurity research companies such as HackerOne, in compliance with the sanction regimes, were able to continue facilitating bounty payments to Ukrainian cybersecurity researchers after resolving some technical difficulties, but they paused payments to researchers in Belarus and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;challenges-of-private-cyber-defenders-in-geopolitical-crises&quot;&gt;Challenges of Private Cyber Defenders in Geopolitical Crises&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst the response of tech companies to defend across the cyber ecosystem has been unprecedented and contributed significantly to Ukraine’s success to date, it has not been without challenges. The limited exposure of tech companies to engagement at this level has led at times to a lack of appreciation of the complexity of their actions, as well as a lack of consistency and coherence across policies. From diplomacy by Twitter to navigating sanctions regimes, political pressure, and the negative impacts of rapid decisionmaking, the lack of experience that private cyber defenders have in navigating geopolitical crises has led to conflicting actions that could at times undermine internet resilience and fail at countering Russia’s offensive cyber operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;moving-fast-and-breaking-things&quot;&gt;Moving Fast and Breaking Things&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rapid action of tech companies in the early days of the crisis reflects an agility that can be valuable to tip the balance of power in a conflict. Whether responding to political and corporate pressure from the outpouring of support for Ukraine, a need to protect employees, fear of sanctions, Russia’s “fake news law,” a genuine demonstration of disapproval, or in some cases even to increase their public relations value, companies moved fast and were far-reaching in their actions. Whilst this may have had measurable impacts at the time, it may also not have offered sufficient time to consider the full ramifications of their actions for long-term cyber stability. This at times has led to backtracking or possibly undermining avenues to counter Russia’s cyber operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sanctions regime threatened the right of Russians to have universal connectivity and left the Russian people more at risk of government information control strategies, as well as threatening the basic nature of the open, globally connected, secure and trustworthy internet. After significant lobbying by Access Now and the Wikimedia Foundation, in April 2022 the U.S. government issued an advisory providing exemptions for companies providing internet services, recognizing the need to keep information flows accessible to people in Russia and Belarus. However, this came too late for key companies such as Lumen and Cogent Communications, who had already withdrawn their services from Russia, partly due to unclear policy. At the other end of the spectrum, the bug bounty platform HackerOne found itself disabling payments to Ukrainian cybersecurity researchers whilst they sought to amend their systems to comply with the sanctions regimes. This prevented them from providing crucial support to Ukrainian researchers — as well as access to knowledge of key vulnerabilities at a critical time, potentially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some companies tried to move slower to strike a more balanced position between supporting Ukraine and preserving the integrity of the internet and access to information for Russians, they found themselves under greater pressure from public calls from Ukraine’s government and consequent stakeholder pressures rather than that of their own governments. In Myanmar, civil society organizations urged Telenor to stay in place as an alternative might be complicit with the regime, thereby worsening the situation. Navigating this level of geopolitical foresight is out of the scope of normal operating procedure for many companies and opens the question of how home governments can shield companies that may have to make unpopular decisions for long-term cybersecurity and internet stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;finding-coherence-to-complexity&quot;&gt;Finding Coherence to Complexity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukraine conflict has highlighted the challenge for commercial companies to find coherence and consistency when navigating information warfare in the heat of complex geopolitical crises. While companies may have acted quickly, this has sometimes been inconsistent with previous actions or policies and has required them to backtrack on their actions. Meta was challenged by inconsistencies within their own content moderation policies when evidence emerged that they had provided a temporary change to their hate-speech policies to allow calls for violence against Russians and Russian soldiers, including Russian president Vladimir Putin and Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko. They then had to revise, limit, and reverse decisions in the face of accusations from Russia that they were fueling hate against the Russian people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social media platforms also found themselves caught in a dilemma when placed in the position of being the evidence repository of war crimes that could be crucial for future criminal tribunals, particularly with how this may intersect with their own terms of service preventing illegal and harmful content. Furthermore, Twitter’s turn to international humanitarian law as the basis of banning tweets showing images of prisoners of war highlighted not only the potential that private companies could be considered parties to the conflict but the lack of clear internal or external guidelines for commercial actors’ decisionmaking in complex geopolitical crises. Tech companies also found themselves caught in balancing public disclosures of their support, having to tread carefully between protecting employees, following corporate principles, and ensuring that their information does not provide strategic advantages for Russia — decisions outside of the norms of its responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies reported that legal counsel was not always nuanced, making it hard for many to carry out a holistic assessment of the wider geopolitical implications of their actions and manage the competing priorities inherent to the cyber dimensions of the conflict. Key to this challenge is that companies are used to assessing risks through a financial lens, rather than through societal priorities or by seeking to reduce their liabilities. For a company that deals with encryption standards, an exit from Russia may be a reduction of liability; but with a long-term geopolitical focus on cyber stability, if that company is replaced by a Russian equivalent, the cyber ecosystem may be more insecure. If cyber stability is going to depend on the controllers of the communications infrastructure being able to navigate through the complexity of both cyber-enabled and cyber-dependent warfare, then new mechanisms are going to be required in order to guarantee greater coherence in times of crises. This includes greater understanding of the decisionmaking procedures that companies undertake in addressing their involvement in geopolitical crises, as well as mechanisms to provide companies with the foundational understanding of the impact of discrete actions through the internet stack — such as withdrawal of service — on geopolitical conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;wavering-clarity-and-commitment&quot;&gt;Wavering Clarity and Commitment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As tech companies responded both independently and under overt and covert political pressure to counteract Russia’s deliberate strategy of cutting or destabilizing internet access, they could not predict the level of long-term commitment this would entail. This has led to tech companies wavering in their commitments and trying to limit the use of their infrastructure provisions, possibly creating greater instability. Starlink — despite its importance to Ukraine’s defense, with over 150,000 Ukrainians using it daily to access the internet by May 2022, and its role in enabling surveillance and reconnaissance aerial vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles — threatened to stop funding the program and asked the Pentagon to take over the costs. Although a large proportion of terminal and internet use costs were being covered by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and other partners, Starlink was seeking further support. Further, SpaceX has restricted the use of Starlink for drones, highlighting that the support was intended for humanitarian purposes but not to be weaponized — possibly putting Ukraine at greater risk, both through the action itself and through the public declaration of their position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November 2022, Microsoft pledged a further $100 million to Ukraine’s digital alliance, promising that Ukraine would be able to use Microsoft’s cloud and data centers in Europe throughout 2023. While the continued support is generous, as Microsoft chairman Brad Smith stated at the Munich Security Conference in February 2023, it is a “one year at a time” approach. This stands in contrast to state positions, such as the U.S. promise to stand by Ukraine “for as long as it takes.” Questions arise as to the dangers of dependency on critical infrastructure or cybersecurity support that can be withdrawn on a whim or under corporate pressures and obligations to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cyber-defenders-as-legitimate-targets&quot;&gt;Cyber Defenders as Legitimate Targets&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Microsoft has been clear that its support in the Ukraine conflict is entirely defensive, as any offensive action would violate its pledge made as a part of the Cybersecurity Tech Accord, from a legal standpoint commercial tech companies may find themselves technically participants to the conflict and thus legitimate targets for attack, particularly with the lines between consumer and military tech becoming more blurred and many militaries relying on consumer tech for military. Even the most sophisticated companies might not anticipate this, with Starlink’s restriction on the use of its terminals for offensive purposes reflecting that they hadn’t fully anticipated this possibility. This would turn quite closely on the nexus between the private company’s action and the consequent military action, or whether the data held in a private cloud was military data. The recent attempt by Ukraine to draft a law to legalize its volunteer IT army into part of its cyber command may help to mitigate the ambiguity for some individual security researchers. However, companies may still remain exposed. Actions such as that of Hacken.io’s “Cyber Army,” in which the intention to hand vulnerabilities to the Ukrainian authorities is clearly stated, could be construed as voluntary participation in hostilities — and thus open the possibility of a private company becoming a legitimate target in retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PREPARING FOR THE NEXT CYBER-ENABLED CRISIS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an era of increasing converging crises, the risks exposed by the Ukraine war are not fading. Ukraine benefited from strong Western support, both politically and in the public sphere, making the case for tech company action relatively clear. In other contexts, it may not be so straightforward. Tech companies have struggled to balance their engagement in more complex crises such as ones in Myanmar and Ethiopia, and the closure of international offices as part of the tech downturn — such as that of Twitter’s only African office — could leave them ill-prepared to address future global challenges. It is also still not clear how companies will fully address the crisis-inducing potential of generative AI systems and similar emerging technologies that could be exploited in misinformation campaigns by reducing the barrier to generating synthetic media, deepfakes, and malicious content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conflict in Ukraine has highlighted the challenges and dangers to cyber stability of trying to formulate sensitive policies under pressure, along with the urgent need for tech companies to be able to assess the impact of their individual and cumulative actions in a crisis or in post-crisis stabilization and reconstruction. New mechanisms are needed, similar to Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) frameworks or Covid-19 protocols, that embed geopolitical risk considerations into the corporate governance of those companies responsible for the cyber ecosystem, in order to ensure coherence and consistency across geopolitical crises. Companies should also seek to embed tech geopolitics experts who see beyond liability into more holistic geopolitical impacts in their decisionmaking procedures, as well as civil society organizations that can provide more nuanced pictures of situations in a country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, governments and the international community need to rethink their interactions with big tech to ensure that they are providing sufficient support for companies to balance their actions with the core principles and norms of the liberal and democratic world order. The role of the company in the internet stack often determines its level of interaction across the cyber ecosystem. Tech companies have highlighted the need for neutral convenors to assist in helping align action without it appearing like big tech collusion or strong-arming. Newer agreements and partnerships, such as the Declaration for the Future of the Internet and the Freedom Online Coalition, have been formulated with these kinds of issues in mind but have struggled to gain influence and traction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internet stability is at the heart of the multi-domain era of warfare. As militaries invest in increasingly interconnected and intelligent weaponry, access to stable, resilient, and secure communications is crucial. And as offensive strategies expand from the depths of the sea to potential interference in interplanetary networking, the range of actors required to defend these domains far expand the capabilities of most militaries alone. Cyber power will belong to those states that create the mechanisms to ensure the coherence, consistency, transparency, reliability, and geopolitical responsibility of those private actors currently defending the cyber front lines of the Ukraine conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2002, the NATO formally acknowledged the need to defend against cyber threats. Over the following two decades, cyber defense was institutionalized and understood as a core part of national defense, by both allies and the alliance. As an example, since 2016, NATO allies have recognized cyberspace as a domain of operations in which NATO must defend itself as effectively as it does in the air, on land, and at sea. At the national level, the majority of states have evolved their position on cyber defense through the development of national strategies, the establishment of national authorities responsible for defending against cyber threats, and a range of additional initiatives designed to deter, detect, defend against, and respond to malicious cyber activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These developments are intrinsically linked with changes in the increasingly complex cyber threat landscape. Now more than ever, adversarial states have shown a willingness and capability to use cyber operations to support their strategic objectives. As a result, cyberspace now plays a key role in strategic competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As NATO’s 2022 Strategic Concept explains, “Malign actors seek to degrade our critical infrastructure, interfere with our government services, extract intelligence, steal intellectual property and impede our military activities.” For that reason, though recognizing that nations must defend themselves against the full breadth of cyber threats, this paper specifically focuses on state-sponsored threat actors, who attempt to use cyberspace to undermine their target’s national security to further their own strategic and military objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine, for example, has highlighted Russia’s willingness to leverage cyber operations in the run-up to — and during — the invasion, against Ukraine and others. Russia has used cyber operations to support a range of strategic objectives in Ukraine, from destructive malware to disrupt and degrade the activities of the Ukrainian government and military to attacks on civilian infrastructure — including critical national infrastructure — to undermine public confidence and trust in the Ukrainian government. The uptick in Russian state-sponsored activity against Ukraine in the months leading up to and including the start of the invasion also showed that the attackers were maximizing their access to data and systems to support intelligence gathering, stealing or leaking sensitive information to further their narratives. Some public reports reveal the targeting of state and non-state actors through cyber operations and kinetic military strikes simultaneously, though it remains unclear if these were coordinated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond those involved in Ukraine, there are a number of state and state-sponsored actors that pose a threat to NATO allies and like-minded states. The United Kingdom has highlighted that China and Russia pose the greatest threat to its national security due to evidence of their sophisticated cyber capabilities, followed by Iran and North Korea. Disruption due to malicious cyber activity has been felt recently across and beyond the alliance. These include a significant disruption from major cyberattacks against Albania’s national information infrastructure in mid-2022, which Albania and other nations have publicly attributed to Iran. More recently, in March 2023, North Macedonia hosted a NATO senior stakeholder visit concerning its ongoing experience defending against hybrid attacks, including cyberattacks. Beyond the significant loss of communications in Ukraine, a major cyberattack against private satellite provider Viasat in February 2022 was reported to have caused disruptions across Europe, far beyond Ukraine’s borders. Throughout 2022, multiple industry research reports have highlighted an increase in malicious cyber activity on users across NATO countries and have linked the activity to several state-sponsored threat actors, largely under the direction of Russian government agencies as well as China-sponsored cyber actors. Nor has Russian malicious cyber activity been limited solely to targets in Ukraine. According to Google, phishing attacks against users in NATO countries from Russian government-sponsored cyber threat actors increased by 300 percent in 2022 compared to 2020. These cyber campaigns are aimed at a broad range of targets, from government and critical infrastructure to private sector organizations and citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, malicious activity in cyberspace against NATO has been assessed as falling below the level of armed conflict. Researchers focusing on cyber defense and national security nonetheless face a conceptual challenge: while “cyber warfare” appears to set the bar too high, given that most cyber operations are below the threshold of war, it is also inaccurate to say that current activity in cyberspace represents a “peaceful” state. Experts have presented conceptual models to understand the current nature of cyberspace, speaking of a state of “un-peace,” or attempting to understand cyber operations within the strategic studies lenses of “sub-threshold” or “gray zone” warfare. In essence, the message for policymakers, as well as senior political and military leaders, is clear: there is no peace in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consensus at NATO is that, as stated firmly in the 2022 Strategic Concept, “Cyberspace is contested at all times.” It is no longer exceptional that states, including NATO members, face disruption to their critical infrastructure due to malicious cyber activity. Reflecting on recent cyberattacks against Ukraine, research by the Economic Security Council of Ukraine argues that the opportunistic use of cyberspace to seek strategic advantages is not expected to change any time soon. Instead, increasing aggression in cyberspace is the “new normal,” and in the context of growing instability internationally, this has several key implications for cyber defenders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognizing this new escalated baseline for state-sponsored cyber activity against NATO and like-minded countries, including Ukraine, this paper reflects on the current cyber threat landscape to consider how NATO allies and like-minded states may effectively defend themselves in this new normal. With a particular focus on the strategic landscape, the paper attends to the need for dynamic strategic positioning for cyber defense, national and international resilience-building efforts, and sustainable engagement with relevant industry actors in peacetime, crisis, and conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-comprehensive-strategic-approach-to-cyberspace&quot;&gt;A Comprehensive Strategic Approach to Cyberspace&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond Ukraine, attacks on NATO nations add to the growing body of evidence that cyberspace is always contested. Russia “seeks to establish spheres of influence and direct control through coercion, subversion, aggression and annexation,” using “conventional, cyber and hybrid means against us [NATO members] and our [their] partners.” It is not alone. The People’s Republic of China (PRC) “strives to subvert the rules-based international order, including in the space, cyber and maritime domains,” using “malicious hybrid and cyber operations and its confrontational rhetoric and disinformation to target Allies and harm Alliance security.” More generally, growing geopolitical instability over the past year has brought security to the forefront of state agendas around the world and prompted a revisiting of assumptions around national security and defense postures. Cyber defense must be considered within this reckoning, reflecting how the cyber threat landscape has evolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defending the rules-based international order requires a cohesive strategic vision, and states cannot go this alone. Broadly speaking, democratic states must not loosen their commitment to the rules-based order — they must instead, as the 2023 Munich Security Conference report reflected, do more to ensure a stable proposal to make this order work for a greater number of states that may otherwise be attracted to Russia and China’s attempts at revisionism. In the cyber domain, there is an equal need to agree on how democratic states can continue to cooperate to develop norms for responsible state behavior in cyberspace, address issues of cyber deterrence, and raise the cost of malicious cyber activity against them. The 2023 U.S. Cybersecurity Strategy outlines an ambitious national agenda for cyberspace that will only be strengthened by sustainable partnerships and the effective use of international organizations, such as NATO, to form a coherent international approach to adversarial state threats. Consensus commitment to using international frameworks to address strategic international threats in cyberspace, whether at the NATO alliance level or beyond, provides a level of collective strength that exceeds any individual state’s efforts to challenge the contested geopolitical landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More specifically, the increasing ease with which authoritarian states use malicious cyber activity to undermine the current rules-based international order requires a commitment from NATO allies and like-minded states to refuse to tolerate this “new normal” and impose painful consequences in response to these escalating levels of malicious cyber activity. This includes a refusal to accept the normalization of state-sponsored malicious cyber activity against critical infrastructure. Democratic states can steer a proactive course by explicitly noting recent escalation in cyberspace and refusing to be complacent to this new, raised baseline of more frequent and disruptive cyberattacks by adversarial state-sponsored actors. This will involve renewing their pledge to a norms-based approach to cyberspace, embracing a dynamic approach to develop new policies and impose costs in line with the evolving cyber threat landscapes, and not sacrificing any commitment to the principles of responsible state behavior in cyberspace, even as adversaries attempt to shirk them in attempt to gain offensive advantages. Any alternative course risks being perpetually on the back foot, handing the initiative to authoritarian states for them to shape cyberspace to their advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various international organizations can help facilitate this shift in vision to different degrees, including but not limited to the NATO, the European Union, the United Nations, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). NATO has made it clear that a single or cumulative set of malicious cyber activities may reach a level of an armed attack, at which point NATO’s North Atlantic Council may invoke Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. This decision is to be taken on a case-by-case basis. Yet for this threshold of “armed attack” to be meaningful, it is essential to have a clear understanding of baseline activity. This means being proactive and refusing to become, as one NATO colleague puts it, a “boiling frog” — referring to an analogy in which a frog in a pot does not realize its worsening situation if the water around it comes to a boil gradually. States must ensure that they do not unwittingly build a tolerance to escalated activity, thus prompting future escalation. Therefore, to prevent adversarial actors subtly raising the threshold of acceptable malicious cyber behavior, states must both deliver on their rhetoric to hold responsible threat actors accountable and double down on resilience to decrease the success of subsequent malicious cyber campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decades-long debate on how deterrence applies in cyberspace has highlighted the complexities of feasibly and consistently holding adversaries accountable. It has become clear that NATO deterrence in cyberspace is underpinned by the ability to deliver meaningful consequences to malicious cyber threat actors. Norms work if they are upheld; states thus require the ability to impose costs on others who intentionally seek to undermine them. The discourse on international norms in cyberspace reveals a contested and complex environment in which in which many nations may have different positions. Still, NATO allies have made it clear in a 2022 statement that NATO is “ready to impose costs on those who harm us [its members] in cyberspace.” It also pledged to revise the alliance’s deterrence and defense posture, including in cyberspace. The successful application of these principles will call for action from beyond the NATO alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a stance not only requires a vision that plans for a variety of future threat landscapes but one that also enables collaboration between states and international organizations to develop a comprehensive answer to cyber defense and deterrence. Within NATO, a coherent allied approach on how cyber contributes to overall deterrence and defense will lay out the consequences of malicious activity in cyberspace to malign state actors. This signaling, in addition to existing diplomatic and economic tools such as joint cyber attribution or responses in other non-cyber domains, shows that allies can be dynamic and act firmly where norms continue to be challenged by states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the national level, relevant stakeholders and decisionmakers across defense communities must understand the nature of cyberspace and the challenges surrounding cyber deterrence concepts. Crucially, they must also understand that the pace and scale of cyberattacks are unlikely to slow down unless actions are taken to adapt and respond proactively. While cyber defenders might feel they are constantly firefighting attempted cyberattacks, failing to make time to elaborate a strategic vision to respond to these attacks risks “missing the forest for the trees” and remaining stuck in a reactive posture in which the firefighting will never cease — and may in fact increase. Without a consistent conceptual approach to cyber deterrence, accompanied by adherence to a comprehensive strategic vision both nationally and internationally, states remain disadvantaged when adversarial states appear to act unpredictably. Strategic thinking also needs to include, and take place on, a supra-national level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;remodeling-cyber-resilience&quot;&gt;Remodeling Cyber Resilience&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing instability across the international landscape has prompted a refocus on cyber defense and resilience as an integral part of national defense. Resilience in this context refers to society’s ability to resist and recover from shocks and combines both civil preparedness and military capability; cyber resilience extends this state to systems relying on cyber resources. There is a growing recognition that governments need greater insight into their cyber resilience posture across the entire national ecosystem, including across the private sector and especially relating to critical infrastructure. In line with a forward-looking strategic vision, a strong cyber resilience posture has been recognized as essential to deter, detect, and prevent malicious cyber activity. Many states have set out their intended plans to enhance their cyber resilience, either as part of a cyber defense strategy or within broader national security doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resilience forms a core part of NATO’s founding principles, in which Article 3 outlines the responsibility of allies to “maintain and develop their individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack” via “self-help and mutual aid.” For cyber defense specifically, NATO encourages nations to strengthen their defensive posture in cyberspace through three mechanisms: the NATO Defence Planning Process, which includes cyber-related capability targets for allies over a four-year cycle; the Cyber Defence Pledge, whereby since 2016 allies have committed to enhancing their cyber defenses with a focus on seven key objectives; and more broadly, the support of each NATO nation’s seven baseline requirements for national resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, many NATO allies have already articulated their cyber defense vision. However, resilience is a continuous and iterative process, and as states face the escalating security situation in the Euro-Atlantic area, their momentum must not falter. Not only must states work to overcome persistent challenges facing capability building relating to cyber defense, but they must also adapt to the threat landscape considering activity in and beyond Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding the former, some challenges are systemic and experienced by the majority of states to some degree, when it comes to strengthening their cyber defense and resilience posture. Limited investment, a shortfall in the skilled cyber workforce (particularly in the public sector and the defense forces), organizational resistance to change, legacy systems, and disengaged leaders can all lead to stagnancy in maturing a state’s cyber defense and resilience posture. To address and overcome barriers to greater cyber defense and preparedness, states must be able to track progress and react whenever they risk falling short of delivering their strategic visions. This requires top-level leadership across government and defense forces, a framework for effective civil-military cooperation — particularly in the high-level transition from peacetime to crisis or conflict — and a consideration of how cyber activity on critical infrastructure may impact military mobility. Enhancing resilience and situational awareness means tackling systemic challenges relating to information-sharing at the national level and between allies. Further, in recent years greater attention has been given to the importance of a healthy national ecosystem of cybersecurity industry actors who can swiftly offer support in a crisis and who are resilient themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effective resilience also means taking a comprehensive approach to cyber defense, which includes tackling challenges in new ways. For example, while many states have now released plans addressing the education of a cyber workforce, there is room for improvement. Few states have a defined strategy for the retention of cyber expertise within the public sector, where they risk losing experts to competitive industry packages, and few states have published a declarative perspective on how they are approaching recruitment of cyber experts for the public sector or the military. For all states, there is a great deal of opportunity to explore in hiring through targeting diversity of all kinds, whether based on gender, career stage (e.g., attracting mid-career talent from other sectors into cyber defense), or discipline (e.g., attracting economists or psychologists into the field). This example of recruitment is one of many in which adjusting to the modern defense environment requires a gear-change in tactics, and states must continue to look forward to acting proactively and decisively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at current events, Ukraine has shown a significant amount about cyber resilience in times of conflict. Significant commentary has focused on the fact that the large-scale cyber campaigns leveraged against Ukraine have had little apparent success. The foremost reason for this is often credited to Ukraine’s cyber resilience, much of which had been actively developed in response to previous Russian aggression against Ukraine, particularly from 2014 onwards. Cyber capacity-building measures appear to have contributed substantively to Ukraine’s resilience, and in turn, the war in Ukraine has prompted states to reflect on cyber defense within broader resilience and crisis management response plans. There are opportunities across the board to strengthen preparedness for a cyber crisis, whether it is by ensuring that there is a cyber crisis response plan or by including cyber in national crisis response frameworks. Such plans should be comprehensive, involving stakeholders across the public and private sectors, with regular exercising to maximize readiness in case of crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A related view on Ukraine’s impressive cyber resilience posture heralds the significant assistance Ukraine received from the United States and others since 2014, which allowed it to decrease its reliance on insecure software and implement many of the cyber defenses that protected it against of Russia’s activity in cyberspace. Outside of armed conflict, the principle of assistance to allies remains much the same and is increasingly relevant beyond formal NATO structures. Ukraine showed allies how critical it is that where a state needs help to protect itself against an aggressor, it gets the support required. Certainly, within the NATO alliance, the principle of resilience follows the adage “a rising tide lifts all ships”; as the relatively more vulnerable states mature their national resilience to malicious cyber activity, the alliance becomes more resilient overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond current commitments, NATO members and like-minded states must be empowered to highlight the best use of capacity-building measures, perhaps by using national cyber maturity assessments (or similar) to check where a state is not meeting minimum baseline levels of security or where they are not making progress over time. The use of a metric-driven approach to cyber resilience — taking care to choose appropriate metrics, of course — would enable states to check their progress over time and to highlight where they are struggling with progress and may need assistance, such as the sharing of best practices, from allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, events in Ukraine and beyond have highlighted the need for effective assistance coordination mechanisms, which could be activated in response to significant malicious cyber activity. Currently, there are no comprehensive frameworks for effectively coordinating cyber assistance in a crisis. Ukraine highlighted this need for a coordinator to swiftly prioritize needs and allocate tasks to a range of public and private actors offering bilateral assistance. Such a framework would need to think about how the receiver prioritizes its most urgent needs in a cyber crisis (or a crisis with cyber aspects); articulates these needs to potential helpers; deconflicts offers of assistance from various actors; arranges the logistics of assistance, including physical movement and access to technology; and deconflicts any issues relating to legal constraints or privileges and immunities, ensuring those offering support in a crisis are legally protected should their actions inadvertently cause damage, in “Good Samaritan” fashion. Therefore, in taking a comprehensive approach, national cyber crisis frameworks and response plans should consider how states could offer, but also receive, cyber assistance from outside actors, including other states and industry providers. Using NATO as a platform, allied states are working to operationalize these activities through the development of a virtual cyber incident support capability, which will operate on a voluntary basis and use national assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final aspect, once an effective resilience plan is in place that accounts for all aspects of cyber defense and crisis management, is to ensure that it works in practice via a comprehensive and holistic approach to exercising and training, including national and international cyber exercises as well as meaningful integration of cyber into joint exercises. These exercises, when mimicking a national crisis, benefit from drawing in stakeholders across military and civil communities as well as from a range of relevant national actors, such as critical infrastructure operators and the cybersecurity industry providers that would likely be engaged in a real-world cyber crisis. While care is needed to avoid duplication against existing exercises or training fatigue where a limited set of skilled expertise is constantly refreshed instead of conducting business as usual, exercising should be leveraged to ensure preparedness across a range of aspects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sustainable-resilience-and-private-sector-engagement&quot;&gt;Sustainable Resilience and Private Sector Engagement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any analysis of Ukraine’s cyber defense activities through 2022 would be incomplete without analyzing the critical role of industry actors, many of whom donated (among other things) licenses, software packages, and infrastructural services. In the immediate run-up to, and early stages of, the invasion in February 2022, Ukraine rapidly ingested a range of private sector and bilateral state assistance in cyberspace. Actors from the private sector proved instrumental in helping Ukraine react rapidly and defend against cyber threats through the provision of cyber threat intelligence, cloud data storage, and a range of cyber defense products including denial of service mitigation services, incident response capabilities, and security software licenses. In the information space, for telecommunications and broader support of digital infrastructure, Starlink’s satellite terminals have been critical in maintaining communications by the Ukrainian military and civilian authorities. Private sector support for Ukraine’s cyber defense efforts has played a significant role in reshaping the conflict. This has been so significant that it has been recognized by the Ukrainian government, to the extent that in May 2022, Google received the first Peace Prize from Ukraine in recognition of the company’s support, which included a significant cybersecurity assistance package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This aspect of direct private sector involvement has prompted a more urgent approach to private-public engagements, with the United States among those claiming to have increased collaboration with industry partners on cybersecurity issues as a direct result of activity in Ukraine. Increased private sector participation, alongside the cyberattack against Viasat, also prompted discussions around private sector actors’ place in a conflict, such when they may be considered legitimate military targets in cyberspace. More broadly, there is an emerging and increasing concern around private sector dependencies and the sustainability of private sector engagement in a crisis, particularly in cases where states may be reliant on industry providers to provide or operate critical infrastructure support. Nowhere is this illustrated more neatly than in the case of SpaceX’s Starlink, a satellite internet service that has been essential in maintaining connectivity for critical services in Ukraine — and the Ukrainian military — since February 2022. When SpaceX announced it was no longer planning to offer the satellites or licenses to Ukraine without cost — having already spent almost $100 million supporting Ukrainian’s internet service — it prompted a scramble in which other actors came forward to sponsor ongoing service delivery. During a dramatic series of public exchanges in autumn, SpaceX highlighted that the company could not “indefinitely” fund Starlink connectivity in Ukraine. While service availability was eventually maintained with external assistance, the loss of these services, which Ukraine has become reliant on during the conflict, could have been devastating to Ukraine’s war effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Starlink may be an extreme example, with few competitors in the market of portable satellite communications technology, the war highlights the sheer number and breadth of actors now enmeshed in the provision of rapid cyber assistance to a state in conflict. Private sector actors cannot afford to give products for free or below cost indefinitely. Ultimately, shareholders have a say, and as more organizations announce their inability to donate services, the limits of this type of ad hoc free support will likely be revealed over time. While Microsoft has announced its support free of charge until the end of 2023, for example, the Telegraph reported that the company likely faced some business impact as a result, turning down new cloud clients in mid-2023 due to capacity constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While private-public cooperation for cyber defense is by no means a novel topic for governments, there is no agreed current market model for private sector actors to sustainably provide cyber assistance in the context of a conflict or where receiving actors cannot necessarily cover the costs involved. Much like the required coherent strategic vision for cyber deterrence discussed in an earlier section, the United Kingdom and its allies will have to face the challenge of market sustainability soon as they look towards Ukraine and beyond. Acknowledging the evolving cyber threat landscape in which we expect governments to continually face cyber crises in the future, stakeholders need market incentives to ensure that they do not end up continually rallying in an ad hoc manner, as in the case of Starlink in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two kinds of incentives to encourage private sector actors to provide support to states who may not have the resources to pay them directly. First, encouraging donations through the perspective of norms and in support of democratic values. This admittedly relies on a moral incentive targeting the values and strategic positioning of service provider — but it can be encouraged. When announcing continued support for Ukraine free of charge through 2023, Microsoft referenced their support of “international stability and the protection of fundamental rights across Europe and around the world.” Recognizing that for-profit organizations have different overarching goals from government defense stakeholders, there is nonetheless a path forward for defense stakeholders to harness and shape the way industry increasingly engages with norms. Second, coordinating alternative funding mechanisms that might include ad hoc bilateral assistance from other states. This may involve the creation of an emergency or sustained funding mechanism through which states with greater resources can contribute funds to shore up a state’s cyber defenses, in line with the international resilience-building measures discussed above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A focus exclusively on the first option — appealing to private sector non-financial motivations — is unlikely to succeed in the long term. For the latter option, it is not yet clear what kind of body or group of states might coordinate such a fund, or if this fund is politically feasible given the expectation of future attacks. A sustainable approach will need to include both kinds of incentive to work for everyone involved and ensure adequate market participation in the long term. This is a market challenge greater than any one nation; it will require states to come together to determine an appropriate framework for engagement. Any framework, in addition to accounting for sustainable provision of services in terms of funding, must also clarify the roles and authorities where private sector organizations provide digital or cyber defense services to ensure seamless integration into national defense. In spring 2023, SpaceX acted to restrict the Ukrainian military’s use of Starlink connectivity for drone control, claiming that the organization’s technology was being weaponized by Ukraine in a way not originally intended and at odds with its terms and conditions of service. While private organizations must retain the right to provide their services as they wish, unexpected changes to the service provision mid-conflict are not, putting it lightly, an effective way to engage and build a commercial relationship. Mechanisms coordinating private sector assistance, in times of cyber crisis and broader conflict, must set out clear frameworks for engagement at the start to avoid such ad hoc surprises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, the driving force for any framework would be to take an active approach to the coordination of assistance. This means setting structures in place so that when nations need to request external industry support during a major cyber incident, mechanisms to arrange this support already exist and can be agile while also accounting for sustainable deployment and maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-1&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current strategic landscape demonstrates that cyberspace continues to be fertile ground for pushing the boundaries of conflict and raising the level of malicious activity against states beyond what is considered acceptable in the rules-based international order. Cyberspace is increasingly used by state-sponsored actors to conduct malicious cyber activity, where they can achieve asymmetric effects while maintaining plausible deniability and provocatively challenge the rules-based order championed by NATO and like-minded nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This contested cyberspace is well on the way to becoming the “new normal,” with a baseline that has incrementally increased over time to the levels of pervasive disruption seen today. State-sponsored cyber operations against critical infrastructure are happening more frequently, and nations must take a proactive stance on cyber’s role in defense. States defending the norms-based order cannot be complacent nor unaware of the “boiling frog” scenario; they must not subconsciously adjust to this new baseline of malicious cyber activity and they must resist becoming more tolerant of their adversaries’ disruptive actions. Instead, policymakers and political leaders must unite at a strategic and political level to present a strategic vision for the rules-based order. For cyberspace, this strategic vision must address deterrence in cyberspace and intolerance to adversarial activity. Second, resilience must remain a priority, particularly for all states struggling to make progress on systemic challenges including resources, capacity-building, and funding. Enhancing resilience means helping all those on whom one depends for overall security. Learning from Ukraine, resilience must also include the ability to adapt quickly in a crisis, with the ability to receive and deliver cyber assistance as required. Finally, there is a future in which cybersecurity providers to Ukraine all withdraw their donated support due to their capacity constraints in a market economy, and this would be hugely disruptive to Ukrainian cyber defense capabilities. The international community needs a model for sustainable private sector provision of assistance — not just for Ukraine, but to be employed in principle wherever a state needs emergency assistance and has funding constraints. The best time to have created such a framework would have been before facing the risks of over-reliance on the private sector in the middle of a difficult conflict. The second-best time is now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-issue&quot;&gt;The Issue&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In order to explore the specific methods and approaches that can advance U.S.-China collaboration on matters of shared concern, the project Advancing Collaboration in an Era of Strategic Competition, a joint initiative between CSIS and the Brookings Institution, is examining a series of historical case studies that demonstrate past instances of cooperation among geostrategic rivals. This inaugural case study examines the motivations and mechanisms of joint U.S.-Soviet efforts in smallpox eradication in the 1960s and 1970s. Even during the Cold War, it argues, the two opposing powers found ways to jointly advance the eradication effort thanks to three critical factors: the facilitating role of the World Health Organization (WHO), the fact that smallpox eradication aligned with the individual interests of each superpower, and the ability of health experts and practitioners to work in relative independence of political forces.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eradicating a human disease is an enormously complex, daunting task. Of the seven attempts so far, only the campaign against smallpox — certified as eradicated in late 1979 — has succeeded. The story is even more remarkable as the effort was led by two global superpowers engaged in their most pitched competition for the hearts and minds of countries around the world. Yet, even though the Cold War prevented collaboration between the United States and the Soviet Union in its early years, it then became a major driver for smallpox eradication as the two countries sought to engage in practical applications of détente while demonstrating their respective strengths on the world stage. Smallpox eradication represented a common goal that served both countries’ domestic interests in eliminating imported smallpox cases. It also allowed the United States to embrace international cooperation as a counter to reputational damages from the Vietnam War and the Soviet Union to showcase its disease control successes. Further, the program facilitated the rivals’ continued competition for influence in developing countries while pursuing their shared faith in medicine and science as an engine of social and economic progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, without the binding force provided by the international system — in this case, the World Health Organization (WHO) — these impulses could not have been acted upon. As the public health arm of the United Nations system, the WHO provides a forum for multinational consideration of and response to common health threats at the ministerial level and through ongoing exchanges among medical and public health professionals. Further, it facilitates vital connections with local and national leaders and on-the-ground operational support that promotes health service access in the most underserved parts of the world. All of these assets came to bear in the achievement of smallpox eradication — considered one of the greatest public health successes in history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the world is very different than it was in the mid-1900s, the story of smallpox eradication provides an inspiring, practical example of how competing world powers can find common ground on common human challenges. Further, it illustrates the invaluable role of international organizations in facilitating cooperation. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected and simultaneously confronts new global threats, including climate change and rapidly moving pandemics, human survival depends on universal commitment to international governance mechanisms that can bridge geopolitical rivalries and provide operating structures for effective action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;eradication-an-audacious-goal&quot;&gt;Eradication: An Audacious Goal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The campaign against smallpox is the only successful instance of human disease eradication in history. To grasp the magnitude of the feat and the mechanisms required, it is important to understand what is meant by the term eradication, what is involved, and the challenges that have prevented other attempts from succeeding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global disease eradication is defined as the “permanent reduction to zero” of worldwide infections caused by a specific agent “as a result of deliberate efforts.” The goal is not only to relieve humankind from a dreaded disease, but also to create a situation where intervention measures are no longer needed. This both reduces costs and eliminates potential adverse effects associated with disease control, such as rare but sometimes serious reactions to vaccination. For a human disease to be considered eradicable, it must meet specific criteria: it must have easily recognizable symptoms that are diagnosable across all geographies, infections must be limited to and transmitted only by humans, and it must be vaccine preventable or subject to elimination through other means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only a handful of human diseases meet the criteria. Since smallpox was eradicated, the International Task Force for Disease Eradication has assessed more than 90 potential infectious diseases and concluded that seven others could be considered candidates: polio, Guinea worm disease, lymphatic filariasis, cysticercosis (tapeworm), mumps, measles, and rubella. (Recently, malaria has also reemerged as a topic, and the WHO has reinstated yaws eradication.) The criteria for an eradicable disease was developed through research and lessons learned from previous efforts. For example, malaria was the focus of intense eradication attempts during the early and mid-1900s, but its transmission via a nonhuman vector (mosquitoes) ultimately led to failure. Earlier attempts aimed at hookworm, yellow fever, and yaws also failed. A campaign to eradicate polio was initiated in 1988 with a hoped-for end date of 2000. Although the effort has reduced worldwide incidence of the disease by 99.9 percent, the program continues today, having now expended more than $18 billion toward the effort. Similarly, a Guinea worm eradication program overseen by the Carter Center has reduced the number of recorded cases to 13 in 2022. So, though most of these campaigns resulted in substantial (albeit sometimes fleeting) reductions in each of the diseases, only the smallpox campaign has been able to reach its ultimate goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although disease experts assert that “in theory if the right tools were available, all infectious diseases would be eradicable,” the endeavor is in fact not only technologically complex, but also in need of significant social, political, and financial commitments. Considerations include ensuring adequate resource mobilization from beginning to end without diverting those needed for other critical health priorities, strong political commitment from all parties, and identification of the disease as a control priority across a broad geography. Educational and advocacy campaigns are a critical part of a successful campaign, as eradication involves high short-term costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eradication requires ensuring that all people everywhere are no longer susceptible to the disease and thus involves reaching previously inaccessible populations in sometimes inhospitable terrain. Eradicators have employed donkeys, helicopters, boats, and motorcycles and traveled through jungles, over mountains, and through swamps. They have overcome civil wars, broken and inadequate equipment, vaccine refusal, and even targeted assassination of staff. Although many efforts face seemingly impossible odds, they also have their advantages. Eradication campaigns offer a clear, winnable objective; galvanize resources and attention for public health; and, if planned correctly, can produce longer-term health infrastructure enhancements. The smallpox eradication campaign, for example, led to the establishment of the WHO’s Expanded Program on Immunization, which strengthens immunization programs in resource-poor countries. Infrastructure used for the polio program has aided in health emergency response and broader disease surveillance, among other contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;superpowers-collaborate-to-eradicate-an-ancient-scourge&quot;&gt;Superpowers Collaborate to Eradicate an Ancient Scourge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smallpox afflicted — and often killed — millions of people throughout history. Historians estimate that as many as 300 million people died as a result of the disease in the twentieth century and millions more were left with deep scarring. An ancient scourge, smallpox was active from at least the fourteenth century BCE. Inoculation efforts against it first began in China as early as the 1500s. Englishman Edward Jenner developed the first vaccine in 1796 based on viral material from cowpox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An initiative for global smallpox eradication was first proposed at the World Health Assembly (WHA), the WHO’s governing body, in 1953. But it wasn’t until Soviet deputy minister of health Viktor Zhdanov brought a resolution in 1958 that the plan was approved. The Soviets saw the program as a way to take their own successful smallpox elimination program to the world stage while also protecting themselves from imported cases from neighboring countries. The proposal also served to push back on what they viewed as excessive U.S. influence at the WHO through advancement of a bold global health program. With its ability to visibly infect all of its victims, its lack of transmission among organisms other than humans, and the advent of modern immunization, smallpox met the criteria of an eradicable disease. Using a quote from Thomas Jefferson (“future nations will know by history only that the loathsome smallpox has existed”), Zhdanov argued that smallpox eradication could be achieved in five years if compulsory vaccinations were initiated in remaining endemic countries. To get the program started, Zhdanov offered 25 million doses of smallpox vaccine annually. The vaccine was freeze-dried — thus heat-stable and usable in a variety of climates without its integrity being compromised — making it a useful tool across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time of Zhdanov’s proposal, widespread vaccination had already eliminated smallpox in North America and Europe, but cases were still occurring in South America, Asia, and Africa, and the disease killed two million people worldwide annually. Even countries with the disease largely under control were subject to outbreaks brought in by travelers from endemic countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the Soviet proposal was accepted at the WHA, the move toward eradication was slow to get off the ground. The WHO was already deeply involved in a U.S.-supported global malaria eradication program that was not going well and would eventually sputter out. Malaria proved a much harder eradication target, as it involved eliminating large populations of disease-transmitting mosquitoes. Although the advent of the insecticide DDT made the prospect of eradication seem feasible, beating back the insect population to the levels required to eradicate the disease proved enduringly difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Impeding the establishment of the smallpox program was skepticism among some at the WHO about the feasibility of eradication overall, and of smallpox specifically, and concern for the organization’s reputation as the malaria program faltered. The WHO began studies on smallpox, standardized the vaccine in developing countries, and provided technical assistance, but its Smallpox Eradication Program initially received minimal funding and virtually no staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States initially gave the program short shrift, viewing it as a Soviet initiative and concerned that it would compete with its own pet project: malaria eradication. Yet over time, as its foreign policy goals shifted, it changed its position. In 1967, the United States spearheaded what came to be called the Intensified Smallpox Eradication Program, backing it with financial and technical contributions, as well as personnel. With U.S. leadership and staff support from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) — and bolstered with more than a billion doses of Soviet vaccine — the intensified program overcame multiple obstacles to record the final case of smallpox in 1977 and achieved official eradication certification in late 1979.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economist Scott Barrett describes smallpox eradication as “one of the greatest achievements of international cooperation — ever.” Although the United States and the Soviet Union drove the program, the WHO created a platform that allowed it to be truly global. Of the $64 million contributed in cash or in kind, $28 million came from 40 countries other than the United States and the Soviet Union, including a sizable allocation from Sweden. The United States provided more than 100 technical staff, but participants also included nationals from 73 different countries who worked closely with leaders and volunteers on the ground. Five countries — the United States, the Soviet Union, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands — produced a step-by-step manual of standard production and testing procedures that ensured an effective vaccine was available worldwide, while researchers in multiple other countries contributed important findings to the effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-united-states-long-pursuit-of-disease-eradication&quot;&gt;The United States’ Long Pursuit of Disease Eradication&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States had long been perhaps the most ardent supporter of global disease eradication. The earliest campaigns were carried out by the Rockefeller Foundation, aimed at yellow fever and hookworm. Although both efforts failed, the image of saving the world from dreaded diseases remained incredibly attractive, especially as appropriate technologies proliferated in unison with U.S. global power after World War II. In the 1950s, the United States became a major financial and technical supporter of a WHO program to eradicate malaria, the organization’s largest undertaking at the time. The program reflected a U.S. penchant for technological fixes for social and medical problems and also served its geopolitical goals; much of the malaria campaign was focused on Southeast Asia, where the United States wanted to increase its influence as the Cold War progressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the disappointments of malaria eradication, and the concept of eradication falling out of favor in some quarters, public health officials at the CDC were eager to prove themselves internationally and had begun responding to disease outbreaks around the globe. Those forays were supported by the broader U.S. government, reflected in a 1963 statement from President Lyndon B. Johnson: “We have the knowledge to reduce the toll of many diseases,” he said, adding that the country should be using its resources and scientific insights “to avert millions of separate tragedies of needless death and suffering.” The CDC’s interest in confronting health issues worldwide meshed with broader U.S. foreign policy goals to support a remarkably successful CDC smallpox eradication and measles control program in Central and West Africa. Starting in 1967, hundreds of physicians and technical staff from the United States supported African countries’ smallpox vaccination programs — an effort that resulted in the elimination of the disease in 20 countries by 1970 and became the model for the global program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the United States’ abundance of technological innovations — most visible in its space program — youthful idealism, and strong focus on internationalism, the early and mid-1960s were an optimistic and expansive period in U.S. history. Seeking to spread his vision of a U.S. society free of poverty and disease onto the global stage and anxious to bolster the country’s image as the Vietnam War dragged on, President Johnson envisioned a “Global Great Society” — an effort to promote advances in science, technology, and medicine as a cornerstone of worldwide economic development. U.S. support for smallpox eradication offered a relatively inexpensive opportunity to express that impulse. “As long as smallpox exists anywhere in the world, no country is safe from it. This dread disease spreads so rapidly, that even a single case creates the threat of epidemic. It is clear that every nation of the world, whether or not it has experienced smallpox in recent years, has a major stake in a worldwide eradication program,” Johnson said in announcing the program in May 1965. Building on smallpox successes in Africa, the United States offered dedicated funding toward smallpox eradication through the WHO and helped initiate the intensified campaign. The program was led by Donald A. Henderson, who had been instrumental to the U.S. smallpox success in Africa, and who retained his CDC salary while working at the WHO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to aligning with U.S. foreign policy goals, smallpox eradication had appeal domestically. The United States was still spending $15–$20 million a year controlling smallpox with a vaccine that could have severe adverse effects. This meant that though the United States eventually spent $32 million on global eradication, the country still benefited in saved costs of domestic vaccination — and, globally, benefits outweighed costs by a ratio of 400-to-1. The campaign had domestic business appeal through a “buy American” approach and through potentially expanding U.S. markets. Activities funded through the United States Agency for International Development were required to use equipment and tools made in the United States. Additionally, the program supported U.S. aims of nurturing the health and stability of developing countries to create more purchasers of U.S. goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By working the program through an international organization like the WHO, the United States could leverage its investments by attracting those of other nations, operate in potentially hostile areas under the auspices of the largely trusted WHO, and avoid perceptions of overstepping. “To carry out our own foreign policies under the aegis of the United Nations helps America directly, as we then get credit for practicing altruism instead of power politics,” UN ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge said in 1957.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russias-history-with-smallpox&quot;&gt;Russia’s History with Smallpox&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smallpox had long been of particular concern for Russians, who lost millions to the disease throughout history. When an outbreak hit the aristocracy in the late 1700s, Catherine the Great arranged for inoculation of the nobility and championed widespread vaccination among the general population. Although deadly epidemics of the disease continued to occur cyclically, vaccination efforts continued and had a measurable effect: Between 1893 and 1898, smallpox incidence in European Russia was 7.4 per 10,000 people. It dropped to 4.4 per 10,000 by 1913.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even so, the disease remained a major concern at the time of the Russian Revolution in 1917. As a way to show its commitment to preventive healthcare, the Soviet government issued a decree in April 1919 instating compulsory smallpox vaccination for the entire population. The move had multiple motivations, from cultivating a healthy workforce to acting as a method for claiming superiority over czarist governments and capitalist Western countries. The Soviet Union continued improving the smallpox vaccine, including ramping up production of a freeze-dried version and ensuring widespread vaccination. Through these efforts, it eliminated the disease from within its borders by 1936.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeking to translate the achievement to a global success — while also wanting to eliminate the hundreds of cases imported yearly from neighbors India and Pakistan — the Soviet Union pushed the WHO to initiate worldwide compulsory vaccinations in remaining endemic countries. Its contributions to the program included research, personnel, and the lion’s share of vaccines used — 1.4 billion vaccine doses between 1958 and 1979.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;smallpox-eradication-and-cold-war-politics&quot;&gt;Smallpox Eradication and Cold War Politics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The WHO ratified its constitution in 1948, just as the Cold War was beginning. The competition between the United States and the Soviet Union for influence among the world’s countries played a major role in the organization’s early years and in smallpox eradication. For example, in protest of what it viewed as disproportionate U.S. influence in the health organization (the United States was then and remains one of the WHO’s largest financial supporters), the Soviet Union and other eastern bloc countries dropped out of the organization in 1949. The nation returned in 1956 as Nikita Khrushchev came to power with a more cooperative international vision that promoted peaceful coexistence and friendly competition, ushering in the period of détente.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1958 WHA marked the first Soviet appearance at the governing body since the Soviet Union’s reinstatement. Its global smallpox eradication proposal was a way to emphasize the nation’s reengagement with a bold move that would challenge U.S. influence at the organization and make its own mark on international health. Eager to welcome the Soviet Union back into the fold, delegates accepted the resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. investment in international health programs, including smallpox eradication, was also largely driven by self-interest and Cold War politics. Johnson administration officials saw the programs as a way to highlight U.S. technological prowess and win “hearts and minds” in countries vulnerable to possible communist influence. As historians Marcos Cueto, Theodore M. Brown, and Elizabeth Fee suggested, “For U.S. policymakers, health work . . . seemed to provide an extraordinary opportunity to demonstrate the power of American technological expertise; to forge a link between health programs, modernization, and anticommunism; and to develop influence in newly independent developing countries.” As one administration official put it: “I leave aside all soft-spoken questions of humanity and brotherhood. I speak only of hardheaded self-interest. The best breeding place for communism is disease and poverty. If we are going to lead the free world in its fight against the bondage of communism, we have to do something about the health of these poor people.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the Cold War rhetoric swirling above them, public health experts generally were left alone to focus on the humanitarian and technical aspects of eradication. Even though there were a variety of potential stress points between the two main supporters of the program, the sides were largely able to work out their differences quietly and effectively. For example, though Soviet leaders initially objected to having an American run the program, they later told director Henderson that they had checked him out and trusted his leadership. Historians credit Henderson’s doggedness and savvy diplomatic skills with keeping the program on track. When it was discovered that some of the Soviet vaccine doses were ineffective, for example, he was able to have quiet conversations with his counterparts in the Soviet Union and facilitate a resolution. When the Soviet Union wanted more of its officials hired onto the program, Henderson went to Moscow to help review candidates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through approaches fostered and supported at the WHO, even while engaged in a pitched battle for influence across the globe, the Soviet Union and the United States were able to harness their domestic and geopolitical self-interests and their mutual interest in using science and technology to advance human development and produce a remarkable public health achievement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;who-the-worlds-public-health-agency&quot;&gt;WHO: The World’s Public Health Agency&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The WHO was a critical focal point for smallpox eradication and continues to play an essential role in global health. Understanding the organization’s purpose and structure helps illuminate the mechanisms by which the smallpox campaign advanced, and which continue to help address the world’s most pressing issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the directing and coordinating authority on global health for the UN system, the WHO’s primary purpose is to provide technical support to countries; establish global norms and standards for products and systems, such as pharmaceuticals and laboratory operations; and recognize and coordinate responses to health emergencies throughout the world. The WHO is governed by the WHA, an annual meeting of health ministers from the organization’s member states. Its executive board oversees implementation of WHA decisions, and the WHO secretariat runs day-to-day activities. Further technical support is provided by designated collaborating centers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supporting the organization’s decisionmaking and technical tools are expert advisory panels made up of medical and public health professionals from around the world. These bodies facilitate a global network of professionals who develop relationships with each other independent of their countries’ geopolitics. Other key governance structures include six regional authorities, country offices, and field staff. Officials in these structures foster critical ongoing relationships with country leaders at the national and local levels and support on-the-ground operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The smallpox eradication campaign depended on all of the WHO’s assets. Global disease eradication required buy-in from all countries, a commitment that could only be achieved through a UN organization like the WHO. The program required countries that had solid national immunization systems to muster the operational support and resources to eliminate smallpox from within their borders. Through the WHO, the United States, the Soviet Union, and other countries could provide strategic and technical aid, along with resources and vaccines, to countries that needed it. Other countries stepped up with research and laboratory resources coordinated by the international health organization. The WHO’s regional and country offices pitched in with operational structures and ongoing relationships with local and national leaders that helped countries facilitate widespread vaccination. The campaign benefited from a dedicated and focused staff equipped with the tools needed to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though the WHO was able to marshal its resources toward the eradication of smallpox, it often struggles to meet the many expectations placed on it. While its complicated governance structure can get in its way, the organization also suffers from vast underfunding. Although expected to serve as the public health agency for the entire world, its current budget is about the same size as that of a large U.S. hospital and one-quarter that of the CDC. As it has from the beginning, it also inevitably finds itself embroiled in geopolitics, since it caters to the sensitivities of all nations. Recently, for example, as the Covid-19 pandemic spread, WHO staff attempted to pull additional case information from a reticent China while ensuring communications channels with Beijing remained as open as possible. The WHO was required to employ maximum diplomatic skills during the event but was judged to be too conciliatory and unduly positive about China’s Covid-19 response. The United States accused the WHO of being too “China-centric,” eventually leading to a temporary halt in U.S. funding to the organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its shortcomings, the WHO has proven indispensable throughout numerous outbreaks and health campaigns. In addition to its role in improving health services worldwide and providing data, support, and guidance in the face of health emergencies, it provides an irreplaceable forum for all countries to discuss common health concerns. While health ministers meet annually at the WHA, medical and public health professionals network regularly through the WHO via expert panels and other forums. Further, WHO regional and country offices provide ongoing support to the world’s poorest countries as they strive to strengthen health services. Under the WHO, experts from more advanced health systems are able to contribute to that effort while largely avoiding geopolitical tensions they would encounter if they acted bilaterally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though the United States in particular is a top bilateral contributor to international health, an effort as monumental and global as smallpox eradication could only have been shouldered under the auspices of the international system since it required universal buy-in, drew on the collective resources of a variety of contributors, and relied on an operational structure trusted in most parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smallpox eradication was driven by U.S. and Soviet domestic and geopolitical self-interest and came at a point when both countries were seeking to showcase their scientific and medical prowess, as well as soften their images through international cooperation and humanitarianism. But achieving those goals, especially during the Cold War, would have been impossible without the international forum and coordinating unit provided by the WHO. As the historian Erez Manela has argued, “bridging the global East-West and North-South divides was crucial for the success of the [Smallpox Eradication Program], and here the WHO served as an indispensable forum. It provided an institutional framework for conceiving of disease control as a global problem, for coordinating a global campaign, and no less important, for taking credit for success that neither superpower would have wanted to cede to the other.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, of all the factors that came together to produce this monumental public health achievement, the WHO is still cited as the most critical factor. As the 1,460-page WHO-issued history of smallpox eradication argues: “The first and most important [factor for success] was the existence of an international organization through which a collective international policy could be expressed and which could call on governments and individuals in fostering and coordinating activities directed towards a common purpose.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-international-system-is-central-to-tackling-global-challenges&quot;&gt;The International System Is Central to Tackling Global Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the WHO, and despite substantial bipolar global tensions, the world was able to come together to rid humankind of a deadly disease. The success was driven in large part by the United States’ and the Soviet Union’s ability to act on their domestic and geopolitical self-interests through the international system. The WHO served as a critical coordinating unit where countries could come together to provide collaborative leadership, strategic and technical guidance, resources, and operational support. Under the WHO brand, an international corps of health professionals was able to work toward a common goal in countries around the world, largely free from macropolitical forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the WHO often struggles with its complex remit, it continues to serve as an irreplaceable forum in an increasingly interconnected and complex world. Yet, as a member state organization with no enforcement power, the WHO is only as strong as the financing and cooperative commitments it receives from national governments. Several efforts are currently under way to improve the WHO’s independence and strengthen country commitments to transparency and adherence to obligations related to global health security. These efforts must also navigate the bilateral dynamics between the United States and China within the WHO, as the politics of great power competition impact each country’s engagement with the organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the ultimate outcome of these efforts is uncertain, the health and economies of all countries depend on improved cooperation as increased population density, more animal-human contact, global travel, and climate change are resulting in a greater number of disease outbreaks and dangerous levels of environmental degradation. The scale and universality of these cross-border existential threats will require a renewed commitment to multilateral governance through the international system. Smallpox eradication can be a model as the world struggles to forge cooperative mechanisms to address today’s common challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

It is understudied and underutilised compared to both UK-France and Franco-German cooperation.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;Following Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea, the relationship attracted more attention, and the intergovernmental relations have intensified after Brexit. However, despite this intensification, the political drivers, alongside differing threat perceptions and strategic cultures, have thus far been insufficient to deepen the relationship in a way that would match the potential for cooperation between these two leading European countries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The UK and Germany are the European top defence spenders and top supporters of Ukraine in military, economic and humanitarian assistance. They have significant diplomatic, defence and security influence, and cooperation would maximise this influence.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Enhanced cooperation would also signal that the UK and Germany are able to work together for the benefit of Europe and maintain unity through the challenges ahead.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Substantial differences between the respective outlook and approaches of the UK and Germany on defence and security are unlikely to be resolved but can be mitigated in certain areas with continued pragmatism and compromise.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s large-scale reinvasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022 was an inflection point for European security. It has prompted a refresh of the UK’s 2021 Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy (IR2021), which was published on 13 March 2023 as the Integrated Review Refresh policy paper (IRR2023), and a refresh of its Defence Command Paper (DCP), which will be published in June 2023. Germany is also currently developing its first ever National Security Strategy (NSS), at a time when Ukraine has underlined the fundamental importance of allies and alliances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This policy paper argues that the transformative effect of the war in Ukraine has made enhanced UK-German defence and security, and foreign policy cooperation more attractive, viable, and necessary, which would benefit European security; and moreover, that this period of joint policy development is the ideal moment to develop a more structural relationship. This shared agenda should be developed with Transatlanticism and Euro-Atlantic security at its core and with helping to lead the development of a European pillar of NATO as a key objective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Ukraine war has transformed European Security, and Russia will continue to be the defining security challenge to 2030. There is now a window of opportunity to lock in structured and planned cooperation – focussed on helping to lead a European Pillar of NATO, rather than the ad hoc and transactional approach that has characterised the current relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The UK and Germany are currently the top two European defence spenders and top two supporters of Ukraine in volume of military, economic and humanitarian assistance. London and Berlin have significant diplomatic, defence and security influence, and thus cooperation on any initiative would maximise this influence and provide a greater chance of its being agreed. It would also signal to allies as well as adversaries that the UK and Germany are able to work together for the benefit of Europe and maintain unity through the challenges ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has helped create practical areas for post-Brexit UK-EU defence and security cooperation, which include sanctions and military mobility. These activities, coupled with the agreement of the Windsor Framework, has demonstrated what pragmatism can achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite an overall improvement of UK-European relations, there remain substantial differences between the respective outlook and approaches of the UK and Germany on defence and security. These are unlikely to be resolved but can be mitigated in certain areas with continued pragmatism and compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;European defence industry is similarly being transformed by the war in Ukraine as demand signals increase and business models adapt to a new security environment. UK and German defence industries are well placed to adapt, but political and structural differences between the UK and Germany are unlikely to provide a step change in cooperation without a corresponding high-level political statement of intent.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extant 2021 UK-German Joint Declaration is accepted as a comprehensive baseline for future cooperation; this paper provides additional recommendations that could further enhance the relationship. These 19 recommendations are provided in the table below by category – Political, Policy, Operational, and Dialogue and Knowledge Sharing – which are also provided throughout the paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/h2HR8V3.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;METHODOLOGY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project was initiated within the framework of the annual &lt;strong&gt;FES-RUSI British-German Dialogue on Defence and Security Policies&lt;/strong&gt;. Official and expert participants agreed that there was considerable scope to enhance the UK-German defence and security relationship in the context of the war in Ukraine and the early days following the Chancellor’s Zeitenwende speech. What was more uncertain was the level of ambition on both sides and identifying the practical areas for cooperation that would produce the most benefit. The discussions helped frame the overarching research questions that this policy paper seeks to answer. The vision timeframe of 2030 was selected to match those of the UK’s IR2021 and IRR2023, NATO’s 2022 Strategic Concept, and the EU’s 2022 Strategic Compass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RUSI-FES (London) project objectives were to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Identify areas for enhanced defence and security cooperation to promote mutual benefits between the UK and Germany and strengthen wider European collective security;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Identify political opportunities and constraints for enhanced UK-German defence and security cooperation, and how these might be addressed; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Build a road map of prioritised and actionable areas for enhanced UK-German defence and security cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve these, the project convened two expert-led joint workshops to consider, respectively, the UK-German relationship within the European security architecture, and UK-German defence industrial cooperation. These workshops provided the foundation material for a research visit to Brussels to understand the EU context. These research activities were augmented by consultations with current and former UK and German officials and the expert community in both countries. Finally, desk-based research was conducted on primary sources such as speeches, government statements and policy documents, alongside extensive media reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;structure&quot;&gt;STRUCTURE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper is structured in four chapters. The first chapter baselines the current UK-German relationship, deconstructs the extant vision of the June 2021 UK-German Joint Declaration, and develops an updated and more specific vision to 2030. Chapter 2 explains how the war in Ukraine has created more favourable conditions to significantly enhance UK-German defence and security cooperation and outlines the associated benefits. Chapter 3 considers defence, security, and foreign policy cooperation, focusing on first, Russia and the Euro-Atlantic, and second, China and the Indo-Pacific, in line with the priorities established by the Joint Declaration. Chapter 4 identifies opportunities for operational cooperation, including those with the defence industry. Recommendations are provided throughout the paper and a summary table is provided in this Executive Summary. These recommendations are categorised as: Political, Policy, Operational, or Dialogue and Knowledge Sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chapter-one&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CHAPTER ONE&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-vision-for-uk-german-defence-and-security-cooperation&quot;&gt;A VISION FOR UK-GERMAN DEFENCE AND SECURITY COOPERATION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first chapter provides an overview of the contemporary UK-German defence and security relationship and its recent developments. It considers the 2021 Joint Declaration vision and proposes an enhanced vision for cooperation to 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-growing-relationship&quot;&gt;A GROWING RELATIONSHIP&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intellectual underpinnings of the Zeitenwende can be traced back to February 2014. Then Foreign Minister Frank Walter Steinmeier (now President of Germany) delivered a speech at the 50th Munich Security Conference in which he declared that Germany must be “ready for earlier, more decisive and more substantive engagement in the foreign and security policy sphere” and assume more responsibility. Subsequently referred to as the “Munich Consensus”, it signalled a change in mentality at the very top of government, especially between then President Joachim Gauck and then Minister of Defence Ursula von der Leyen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Germany then began to do more. Having already deployed soldiers to Mali in 2013, in 2015 the Bundeswehr joined anti-ISIS operations in Syria and Iraq, became the European colead of the “Normandy Format” which sought to mediate the growing Russia-Ukraine conflict and, in 2016, became the framework nation for NATO’s Enhanced Forward Presence (eFP) in Lithuania. While these developments demonstrated increased, if modest, operational activity, core Germany foreign policy towards Russia and energy security endured. Aylin Matlé suggests less of a change than first appears and that “it is difficult to discern a sound strategy behind all these actions and commitments – unless assuming more responsibility is a strategy in and of itself”. At the UK-hosted NATO Wales Summit later in 2014, Germany also agreed to meet the NATO two per cent GDP Defence Investment Pledge by 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As German activity increased, the UK 2015 Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) declared that “We will work to intensify our security and defence relationship with Germany”. This statement elevated the UK-German relationship to “Tier 1” status alongside the US and France, and this language was mirrored in the 2016 German Defence White Paper which promoted “the security partnership with the United Kingdom, which has a long tradition and which we aim to further expand in all areas of common interest”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Brexit vote in 2016 and the UK’s leaving the EU in 2020 required a reconsideration of the two countries’ intergovernmental relationship during a period of intensely strained political ties due to the UK decision and approach. In October 2018, a Joint vision Statement was signed by the countries’ respective Defence Ministers to commit to stronger defence cooperation, including retaining a permanent UK military presence in Germany, which is the extant framework for bilateral defence cooperation. This statement was agreed in 2016 but the signing was delayed for two years due to the political consequences of the Brexit process. The IR2021 namechecks Germany, alongside France and the Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) with the ambition to “improve interoperability with Euro-Atlantic allies”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June 2021 the UK-German Joint Declaration was signed, which committed to holding an annual Foreign Ministers’ Strategic Dialogue on “all matters of foreign policy and international affairs”. The first Strategic Dialogue was held on 5 January 2023 with support for Ukraine, energy security, and climate change the main agenda items. The German Foreign Minister spoke of the desire to “further intensify” the relationship. The UK Labour Party also expressed its intent that a defence partnership, or Partnerschaft, could be agreed between the two countries in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, over the last decade there has been a stronger desire for cooperation and more common ground identified, yet practical activity has remained modest – compared to the potential – and largely ad hoc and opportunistic where it has occurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-1--political&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recommendation 1 – Political&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The UK and Germany should develop a strategic approach to bilateral cooperation, instead of the ad hoc approach that has characterised the past relationship, by setting clear mutual goals and establishing the right mechanisms and processes for delivery, managed through the UK-German Strategic Dialogue or a more ambitious future agreement.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE 2021 UK-GERMAN JOINT DECLARATION&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2021 UK-German Joint Declaration outlines a “shared strategic vision” across four foreign and security policy priorities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Transatlantic relationship;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China and the Indo-Pacific; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Climate change and biodiversity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the priorities are right, the Joint Declaration is too comprehensive and broad to provide specific measures for intensified cooperation. It is most detailed on foreign policy, covering all global regions with high-level ambition statements, rather than concrete ideas on how to achieve them. Thematically, it is similarly general, referring to a wide range of security issues without any prioritisation. Moreover, it already feels dated in a post-Ukraine security environment, even referencing the Normandy Format and Minsk Process to achieve stability and security within Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-2--policy&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recommendation 2 – Policy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The UK and Germany should update the 2021 Joint Declaration following the publication of the UK IRR2023 and German NSS to provide a shared vision on the measures necessary to strengthen European defence and security and how best to ensure long-term support for Ukraine.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-3--political&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recommendation 3 – Political&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Extend the annual Strategic Dialogue from Foreign Ministers only, so as to include Defence Ministers as a “2+2” format, to better reflect the defence policy orientation of the Zeitenwende and the UK’s contribution to the defence of the Euro-Atlantic area.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;This should be accompanied by regular dialogues between the Prime Minister and Chancellor to set the level of ambition and maintain political momentum, including official government-to-government consultations.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE UK AND GERMANY ARE MORE ALIKE THAN THEY REALISE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK-German relationship is an “Alliance of values”, founded in the principles of the UN Charter, a strong belief in the value of a Western-orientated international system, and a recognition that each country has benefitted greatly from it. Transatlanticism and NATO are at the core of their respective defence policies and strategic cultures, with Germany’s EU membership also of critical importance. The UK and Germany are the two leading European defence spenders and are also the leading European suppliers of military, economic, and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. They each possess strong domestic defence industries of strategic importance and there are multiple advanced defence industrial relationships, such as the Rheinmetall BAE Systems Land (RBSL) joint venture, which demonstrates how a highly capable structure can be quickly created when the need arises. The intergovernmental relationship is well complemented by other non-governmental fora, such as the annual Königswinter Conference (since 1950) and the specific Defence Königswinter Conference (since 2010).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strong ties exist between the two countries, exemplified by His Majesty the King’s first state visit to Germany; in addition, on 30 March 2023, he became the first British monarch to address the Bundestag, speaking in German, which was a strong signal of British-German friendship. Moreover, following the first Strategic Dialogue, the UK-Germany Cultural Commission met for the first time in 30 years, an event which highlights the strength of the wider relationship outside of defence and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LIMITING FACTORS AND STRATEGIC CULTURE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Structurally, the principal differences in defence and security are that the UK is a nuclear weapons power – with bipartisan commitment to the UK’s independent nuclear deterrent – and has permanent membership (P5) in the UN Security Council (UNSC), while supporting a future permanent seat for Germany, and the UK is no longer a member of the EU and its security apparatus. There are also fundamental differences in strategic culture, and prior to the Ukraine war, differing threat perceptions regarding Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are multiple volumes of works dedicated to explaining German post-war strategic culture development and how it was shaped by its traumatic experience of nationalism and militarism. It evolved a culture which has been characterised by a strong preference for soft power and a rejection of hard power and unilateralism, a belief in trade as the primary basis for promoting positive external relations, and a lack of confidence in external security policy where the military instrument is required. Moreover, the post-war political and electoral system was designed specifically to favour consensus, which has inhibited controversial policy choices and translated into an enduring strong preference for operating multilaterally in international relations, with the Bundeswehr as a “parliamentary army”, always requiring mission approval from the Bundestag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But public attitudes have been changing. The traditional aversion to hard power and the use of force has gradually reduced as the Bundeswehr has increasingly been deployed, especially outside of Europe, albeit on modest missions, as the external environment has grown more hostile. However, this aversion still remains high, with 51 per cent opposing military operations (down from 65 per cent in 2019) and 50 per cent rejecting increases in military spending. The war in Ukraine has had an immediate impact, with high levels of support for the Zeitenwende vision and continuing support to Ukraine, despite the direct economic costs to Germany and its citizens. Indeed, the societal and cultural change required in Germany is critical to realising a true Zeitenwende, whereby simply allocating more money for defence is not the answer and will not deliver or sustain a transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast with Germany’s preference for multilateralism and collective solutions, the UK has always preferred a more flexible approach, combining multilateral (through NATO mainly, but with a strong commitment to the UN), through minilateral (5 Eyes, JEF, etc) and through bilateral defence engagement, primarily with the US. When these options do not meet UK objectives, it is comfortable operating in coalitions of the willing, including operations involving the use of force. As the UK has gradually orientated toward operating in a world with more acute great power competition, it has continued to accept that effective foreign policy needs an active defence component, demonstrated by the UK approach to both Iraq and Afghanistan, and most recently exemplified by significant military support to Ukraine and its European allies and partners, and its enhanced military engagement within the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These embedded differences do not necessarily prevent cooperation. Compromises will be required on both sides to unlock enhanced cooperation. Indeed, the key to a successful UK-German partnership will be predicated on reconciling or mitigating these essential differences by unifying around a common aim. Coalescing around strengthening Euro-Atlantic security and support for Ukraine will also gradually make these differences less significant. Moreover, enhanced UK German cooperation could also prevent the fragmentation of European security:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Initially it might seem counterproductive, or even contradictory, to promote deeper cooperation between two countries with diverging perspectives on strategic culture and European integration. Yet it is exactly because of these differences that Berlin and London should strengthen their relationship. At a time of change across the Atlantic and within Europe, especially with the ongoing Brexit negotiations, it is essential that Germany and the United Kingdom prevent divergences from growing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has made this even more necessary and the need is only going to grow stronger as the war continues. Moreover, the primacy of NATO is the most significant entry point for enhancing the relationship and the institution where the two countries could add the most value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AN UPDATED JOINT 2030 VISION&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper proposes that the UK and Germany, as leading European defence and security actors with shared values and security challenges, should commit to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Revitalising and deepening the defence and security bilateral relationship between our two countries with Transatlanticism and Euro-Atlantic security at its core;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Co-leading the development of a European pillar of NATO, building on the leadership of their respective Framework Nations Concepts, in order to increase European burden sharing;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Securing long-term support for Ukraine;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Growing defence industrial collaboration through more joint defence procurement projects; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cementing readiness at the heart of current and future force structures.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chapter-two&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CHAPTER TWO&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-the-war-in-ukraine-makes-enhanced-uk-german-defence-and-security-cooperation-more-viable-necessary-and-beneficial&quot;&gt;WHY THE WAR IN UKRAINE MAKES ENHANCED UK-GERMAN DEFENCE AND SECURITY COOPERATION MORE VIABLE, NECESSARY, AND BENEFICIAL&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter argues that the war in Ukraine and the security challenges it has unleashed have created strong drivers to invest in the UK-German defence and security relationship. It articulates why enhanced defence and security cooperation is beneficial for both countries and for wider Euro-Atlantic security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-war-in-ukraine-and-the-transformation-of-european-security&quot;&gt;THE WAR IN UKRAINE AND THE TRANSFORMATION OF EUROPEAN SECURITY&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine is transformational for European security and Russia will remain the defining challenge for the remainder of the decade. The UK and Germany are second and third respectively in military, humanitarian, and financial assistance to Ukraine. If Germany’s share of EU support is included, then it ranks second to the US overall. The UK has already committed to match the 2022 support of 2.3 billion pounds in assistance in 2023 and German support could significantly ramp up this year with more funding requested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war has already had a significant impact on the security environment and will likely be the primary driver of transformation for the remaining decade. Within one year it has:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hardened NATO defence postures, driven Alliance transformation, and solidified a near unanimous view of the threat posed by Russia;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Produced structural changes, with Finland joining NATO and Sweden hoping to be not too far behind, and Denmark having removed its EU Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) opt-out through a referendum;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shifted Europe’s politico-military centre of gravity eastward, with Warsaw, rather than Berlin, London or Paris, becoming a focal point. US President Biden has visited twice within a year, and given a major speech to mark the anniversary of the invasion. When support to Ukraine is measured as a percentage of GDP, the Baltics come out on top; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Significantly increased defence expenditure and investment, especially in Germany, France, and Poland, to levels seen at the end of the Cold War, which has changed defence industry business models.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war makes UK-German defence and security cooperation more viable and necessary for four principal reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Zeitenwende vision unlocks broader and deeper opportunities for defence and security cooperation than have previously been viable;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;UK and German threat perceptions are in greater alignment and the war has reaffirmed the importance of alliances, allies, and the need for greater cooperation;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If this transformational moment is mismanaged, there is a risk that European security will fragment, which would be against UK and German interests and therefore it provides a strong incentive to jointly mitigate this risk. Enhanced UK-Germany defence and security cooperation would send a strong signal to allies and adversaries alike about the importance of Euro-Atlantic unity in the face of growing threats; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A poor global economic outlook and the requirement for defence modernisation and increased stockpiling creates strong drivers to realise long-term economic efficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-4--political-and-policy&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recommendation 4 – Political and Policy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The UK and Germany should explore the potential for and content of a bilateral Treaty-based defence and security relationship, consistent with NATO obligations and transparent to EU security structures, to realise the current untapped potential that such an agreement could deliver. This agreement should build on work already undertaken through UK and German leadership of their respective Framework Nations Concepts and should focus on increasing European burden sharing and enhancing readiness of forces.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its objectives should include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enhanced cooperation on Northern European security;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Increasing European burden sharing to shape a European pillar of NATO;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Developing further effectiveness and interoperability, with the principle of complementarity and specialisation; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Expanding defence industry cooperation and developing cooperative equipment programmes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-zeitenwende&quot;&gt;THE ZEITENWENDE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The powerful Zeitenwende speech of 27 February 2022 fundamentally accelerated the process of change which had begun with the Munich consensus and marked a point of no return. In the speech, the Chancellor committed to a dual funding settlement of first, a 100 billion euro special defence fund for long-term military projects, outside of the regular budgetary process and, second, meeting the NATO two per cent defence spending target by fiscal year 2022–2023, which in any case will not be met. These announcements complemented other decisions that month to halt the completion of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, exclude Russia from the SWIFT global financial transaction service, rapidly diversify away from Russian oil and gas imports, and approve the delivery of lethal aid to Ukraine, which together marked a seismic shift in Germany’s geopolitical position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In just one year, Berlin has progressed from promising 5,000 helmets to suppling MBTs, artillery, and air defence systems to Ukraine. The establishment of the 100 billion euro special fund also required changes to the Constitution – an action that the chancellor described as “the starkest change in German security policy since the establishment of the Bundeswehr in 1955”. The criticism of Germany regarding the implementation of its strategic shift has been fierce at times, but there are deep cultural sensitivities towards defence and security that still exist in Germany which partners need to understand and need to appreciate the substantial steps that have already been taken. Germany is currently undergoing significant change in many policy fields, with the Bundeswehr and defence being the most difficult area to change, requiring adequate time for involved departments to prepare for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While much of the criticism has been unjustified, 15 months after the Chancellor’s speech, much of the actual scope of the Zeitenwende remains to be clarified beyond the financial commitments. There is also debate about the significance of the announced reforms, with some in the analytical community arguing that real change has yet to begin, and that shifts in energy security have far exceeded steps toward military modernisation. There is also a widespread concern that the sense of urgency and political momentum for a transformative change might already be lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What has also become clear since the February speech is that, while more money helps, in view of the starting point for German defence it is insufficient to enact the change demanded. To be sustained and enduring, any change needs to ensure far-reaching shifts in German strategic culture – something which Chancellor Scholz explicitly acknowledges in his Global Zeitenwende essay. Without such change, practical reforms are difficult to drive through. Thus, while the new Defence Minister is credited with bringing the required purpose and energy to his department, some observers argue that the Bundeswehr is actually in worse shape one year after the Zeitenwende speech, as the 100 billion euro fund is yet to make an impact. Moreover, the Defence Minister has already requested an additional 10 billion euros for the regular defence budget in 2024 but faces difficulties in gaining agreement from the FDP Finance minister Christian Linder. Again, the complexity of overhauling the Bundeswehr, reforming procurement, and absorbing new funds while at the same time supporting Ukraine is a significant challenge and such cultural changes cannot be made overnight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the Zeitenwende approach still developing, there are opportunities for allies and partners to shape its future and to assist Germany in accelerating this process. The UK is supportive of the Zeitenwende vision, and should offer support where necessary to internationalise it as it would obviously strengthen European security, but the UK remains unconvinced about its delivery, especially over the long-term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-mutual-relationship-with-the-us&quot;&gt;THE MUTUAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE US&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important bilateral relationship for both the UK and Germany is with the US, and both have a transatlantic security outlook. Their mutual strategic objective is to keep the US as engaged as possible in European security. This synergy should be fundamental for enhanced cooperation as initiatives that mutually support this goal will be well supported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A longstanding US request of partners has been to take on more responsibility, and the issue of burden sharing within NATO has been a perennial problem for Euro-Atlantic security since the end of the Cold War. The war in Ukraine, coming just 6 months after European doubts regarding US leadership after the fall of Kabul, has highlighted the fundamental role the US plays in European security, evidenced by the pace and scale of US support to Ukraine. The 2022 US National Defense Strategy prioritises the “pacing challenge” of China in the Indo-Pacific over the Russian challenge to Europe. Therefore, now more than ever, the US needs European countries to step up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With London and Berlin acutely aware of the possibility of US policy changes, following the 2024 US Presidential election, it is in their mutual interest to mitigate any possible future unity challenges between the US and Europe by preparing now. The UK and Germany are already committed to increasing European burden sharing and capabilities, within a NATO context, through leadership of their respective NATO Framework Nations. Yet, with a worsening security environment there is considerable scope for expanding the Framework Nation approach and developing European capabilities. Indeed, combined, the UK and Germany already have experience and are best placed to provide the required leadership and set a vision and level of ambition to other European countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-mutual-relationship-with-france&quot;&gt;THE MUTUAL RELATIONSHIP WITH FRANCE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any strengthening of the UK-German relationship must consider how it might impact existing relationships with France. Moreover, strengthening the UK-German relationship does not serve as a replacement for the one which they both enjoy with France. The two other sides of the “E3 triangle” are well established and bolstered by bilateral treaties. The UK-France relationship is governed by the Lancaster House Treaties of 2010. These treaties are substantial and cover a broad range of security areas, including nuclear and the establishment of the Combined Joint Expeditionary Force (CJEF).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Franco-German relationship is governed by the enduring Élysée Treaty, which celebrated its 60th birthday on 22 January 2023, with a summit that committed to enhancing Franco-German and European security and defence cooperation, particularly on closer EU-NATO cooperation and capability development. This relationship was reinforced with the 2020 Treaty of Aachen on Franco-German Cooperation and Integration, which committed to deeper cooperation in foreign, security and defence policy including strengthening the ability for Europe to act autonomously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While both relationships are structurally strong, they are vulnerable to the political weather. Brexit, and then the September 2021 Australia-UK-US “AUKUS” defence partnership, which undercut the French defence industry, has damaged the UK-France relationship. However, there have been recent positive developments with the first UK-France Summit since 2018 on 10 March 2023, which included deepening defence and security ties in all domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been mounting Franco-German disagreements over a hydrogen pipeline from the Iberian Peninsula to Central Europe and a unilateral German 200 billion euro energy aid package, which contributed to an October 2022 Summit being cancelled at short notice. Defence cooperation is also under strain with reports that the Franco-German Future Combat Air System (FCAS) and Main Ground Combat System (MGCS) programmes are both experiencing trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the UK and Germany have Brexit legacy complications to cooperation, which appear to be fading with the formal adoption of the Windsor Framework. Moreover, support to Ukraine has brought the UK, Germany, and France closer together and has provided a long-term mutual objective for defence and security cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chapter-three&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CHAPTER THREE&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-vision-for-uk-german-defence-and-security-cooperation-1&quot;&gt;A VISION FOR UK-GERMAN DEFENCE AND SECURITY COOPERATION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter considers options for enhanced UK-German foreign, defence and security policy cooperation. It focusses heavily on Euro-Atlantic cooperation based on the 2030 timeframe of the roadmap and the priorities established by the Joint Declaration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;euro-atlantic-security-and-the-threat-from-russia&quot;&gt;EURO-ATLANTIC SECURITY AND THE THREAT FROM RUSSIA&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK was already well attuned to the Russian threat, notably because of Russia’s use of chemical weapons within the UK in Salisbury in 2018, which was called out explicitly in the IR2021. Despite the Russia challenge being well analysed in the 2016 White Paper, many German politicians and policymakers did not think that the war would happen, certainly not at the scale that was unleashed on 24 February 2022. The German leadership was confronted for the first time with the brutality and proximity of the Russian threat and the new government has had to manage a steep learning curve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-primacy-of-nato-for-european-security&quot;&gt;THE PRIMACY OF NATO FOR EUROPEAN SECURITY&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2021 Joint Declaration is unequivocal to the shared importance of the transatlantic alliance, stating that “NATO is the cornerstone of Euro-Atlantic security. It remains the bedrock of our collective defence. We recognise the importance of a stronger and more capable European contribution to this. We remain jointly committed to NATO-EU cooperation”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the Joint Declaration was signed, NATO’s response to the war in Ukraine and Russian aggression was enshrined in the 2022 Strategic Concept, which significantly hardened its defence and deterrence posture to “defend every inch of NATO territory”. There was close coordination between London and Berlin in strengthening the eFP to deploy a Brigade headquarters in their respective multinational battlegroups (Estonia and Lithuania) and to scale to that echelon quickly if the threat dictates. While the Baltic states had requested Divisions, which the UK and Germany cannot currently credibly field, this agreement seems acceptable to them and allows the UK and Germany the necessary time to improve readiness of their own forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO is also developing an ambitious New Force Model with more substantial forces at much higher readiness. Germany was the first to commit forces publicly, including an armoured division, while the UK has also committed significant forces. The UK and Germany are also framework nations for NATO’s Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (vJTF), which Germany is leading in 2023, before handing it over to the UK for 2024. The 2021 DCP commits to investing in existing UK storage facilities in Germany to increase readiness and recognises this as a critical location for the forward deployment of UK forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-5--policy&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recommendation 5 – Policy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The UK and Germany should lead by example and, further to the commitment of initial forces to NATO’s New Force Model, they should jointly develop and lead alliance readiness initiatives to help correct problems within their own forces and incentivise other allies to invest in and prioritise readiness. Such a common initiative would strengthen European Security by making a European pillar of NATO more credible and build trust amongst allies.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-6--dialogue-and-knowledge-sharing&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recommendation 6 – Dialogue and Knowledge Sharing&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Germany should offer positions for UK liaison officers for the 2023 vJTF rotation to help support UK planning and ensure a smooth handover for 2024. This should then be institutionalised for further rotations.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK and Germany also lead separate NATO Framework Nations Concepts (FNCs), which were championed by Germany in 2014 to increase the breadth and depth of European NATO capabilities. The German Framework Nation largely focusses on capability development through a “coherent capability package”. In contrast, the UK contribution, through the Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) is an operational framework that has significantly increased its activity in response to the Ukraine war. While the benefit and value of JEF is well understood by its members, there is a scepticism by some of its non-members, including Germany. Our research suggests that this scepticism stems from a lack of understanding about the JEF and its development, rather than an inherent dislike for the framework. It would be advantageous to the security of Northern Europe for Germany to be more closely aligned with the JEF, especially as Germany leads the eFP battlegroup in Lithuania and has highly integrated land forces with the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-7--dialogue-and-knowledge-sharing&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recommendation 7 – Dialogue and Knowledge Sharing&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The UK should better communicate the JEF and its likely future development to German and other non-member audiences. This should include an offer to host German liaison officers at the JEF operational headquarters&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could support the use of JEF + Germany formats and initiatives (and +Poland), such as the physical and cyber protection of critical national infrastructure in the North and Baltic Seas, which has emerged as a common vital interest. Germany is a central player in Northern Europe – the UK’s Euro-Atlantic priority – and the Baltic Sea in particular, especially for Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities and operations. Moreover, following the Nordstream 1 and 2 pipeline attacks, the need to protect critical national infrastructure in the region has been elevated, for which the UK has procured two multi-role Ocean Surveillance ships to be in service by 2023. Germany has ordered the P8A Poseidon Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPA) which the UK and Norway both operate and is an area where the three countries have significant interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-8--operational&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recommendation 8 – Operational&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The UK should invite Germany to join its trilateral agreement on P8 Poseidon MPA with the US and Norway to increase availability and sustainability of ISR in the North Atlantic, High North and Baltic Sea region and provide more continuous coverage for each sub-region.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CLOSER COOPERATION BETWEEN THE UK AND EU&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third paragraph of the 2021 Joint Declaration affirms the unshakeable German commitment to the EU – “For Germany, its membership of the European Union remains a key reference point and it supports cooperation between the EU and the UK” and it will ensure the “highest possible level of transparency” regarding bilateral undertakings with the UK. Therefore, any UK-Germany bilateral cooperation is heavily dependent on good UK-EU relations which are at a post-Brexit high following the adoption of the Windsor Framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has already strengthened the potential for future UK EU defence and security cooperation for several reasons. First, this has been accomplished through practical cooperation on Russian sanctions. Second, this is further aided by the common goal of support for Ukraine which the EU has conducted through the European Peace Facility. Third, the UK has now joined the EU Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) project on Military Mobility, which opens up the possibility of joining other projects. Finally, the war has helped to clarify the division of labour between the EU and NATO, through their third Joint Declaration, which signalled less competition and more cooperation and complementarity with each other. These have already led to discussions on further UK-EU defence cooperation, including counter terrorism and cyber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closer UK-EU ties will require balance and concessions for both the UK and Germany. Germany wants a close relationship with the UK, but also wants to strengthen the CSDP to move towards greater strategic sovereignty. This might require accommodating the UK preference for bilateralism and ad hoc cooperation, in contrast to German and EU strategic culture. In turn, the UK will likely have to accept and foster more formal and institutional links with the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHINA AND THE INDO-PACIFIC&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Europe, the direct threat that Russia currently poses to the Euro-Atlantic is the highest priority, but the importance of China and the Indo-Pacific will only grow throughout the remainder of the decade, especially for defence policy. China has achieved 28 consecutive years of military growth – the longest uninterrupted period of spending growth in the SIPRI military expenditure database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is little European consensus on China, as the approach must balance economic and trade interests with the harder defence and security policy realities. The pandemic and the war in Ukraine have exposed the risk of being heavily reliant on authoritarian regimes for raw materials and supply chains. This balance will be difficult to manage by reducing economic dependencies and risk (China is Germany’s largest trading partner and the EU’s second largest) while also cooperating more on issues such as climate change. This lack of consensus was highlighted during President Macron’s April 2024 state visit to Beijing, alongside EU Commission President Ursula von Der Leyen, which received heavy transatlantic criticism for comments on his perceived European view on Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The German government coalition agreement committed to develop a China strategy, to be adopted imminently, which is likely to follow a harder line on China, especially over “massive human rights violations”. Not only is this an opportunity to reconcile policy differences within the coalition and influence EU policy, with a desire to Europeanise its own policy, but also to establish concrete priorities. Both Chancellor Scholz and Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock have recently visited Beijing, with both taking a tougher stance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK IRR2023 describes China as an “epoch-defining challenge” and Foreign Secretary James Cleverly set out three pillars of UK policy: to strengthen UK national security protections where threatened; to deepen cooperation and strengthen alignment with partners in the Indo-Pacific and globally; and to engage directly with China, bilaterally and multilaterally, to maintain relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current UK and German approaches show signs of pragmatism, are consistent with the 2021 Joint Declaration, and develop synergies, especially Pillar Two of the UK approach. With development ongoing, it is unlikely that there will be immediate substantial areas of cooperation. However, an increase in dialogue can help develop those strategies and create greater synergies, especially as the UK and German positions are closer than those of France at present; moreover, having a closer position between two leading European nations will influence a more coherent European position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;maritime-cooperation-in-the-indo-pacific&quot;&gt;MARITIME COOPERATION IN THE INDO-PACIFIC&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK and Germany, alongside the Netherlands and France, are the only European countries to have developed Indo-Pacific strategies, in addition to the EU as a whole. The IRR2023 designated the Indo-Pacific as the second geographic priority but noted that the prosperity and security of the region and the Euro-Atlantic were inextricably linked. Moreover, it also noted that the Indo-Pacific “tilt” of the IR2021 was now complete and achieved through largely non-military means. In September 2020, Germany published its Policy Guidelines for the Indo-Pacific Region which aimed to strengthen strategic and security policy partnerships and cooperate in tackling human-induced climate change and diversifying and strengthening economic ties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European military cooperation within the Indo-Pacific, thus far, has been ad hoc and transactional. Moreover, Indo-Pacific partners have limited capacity to absorb increased and uncoordinated European deployments. In 2021, the UK sent a Carrier Strike Group (CSG) to the region with a Dutch escort frigate. At the same time, Germany deployed the Bayern frigate for a solo tour, to support its international obligations and demonstrate that it is a reliable partner in the world. Unlike the UK and France, Germany does not have the history or the territorial assets to support a more ambitious deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IR2021 wanted to “look for ways to work more closely with European partners, including France and Germany” and increased naval deployments to the Indo-Pacific would add value bilaterally and for Europe more broadly. The UK and France, at the March 2023 summit, agreed “to coordinate their carrier deployments to provide complementary and more persistent European presence in regions of shared interest”. Closer cooperation here would allow Germany to participate in a region of growing importance more actively and enhance power projection nationally and add to a significant European presence, in line with the 2021 EU Strategy for Cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. Moreover, as the majority of the 100 billion euro special fund will be absorbed elsewhere, Germany might need support in the maritime domain and could also become an area of closer cooperation, especially in the Baltic Sea, for future deployments, exercises, or a coordinated maritime presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-9--operational&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recommendation 9 – Operational&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The UK should invite Germany, along with other EU partners, to provide an escort ship, or a marine contingent, to a future Carrier Strike Group deployment to the Indo-Pacific. This would meet the Defence Command Paper commitment to “partner more often with Germany on operational deployments, such as air policing and naval missions outside the Euro Atlantic area”.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;REFAMILIARISING WITH ISSUES OF NUCLEAR SECURITY&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine and the risk of escalation is bringing the fields of European security and nuclear strategy back together, following a divergence after the Cold War. A conventionally weakened Russia, especially in the land domain, will likely increase its use of nuclear and hybrid levers to achieve its political and strategic objectives. Moreover, on 21 February 2023, President Putin announced the “suspension” of Russian participation in the New Start Treaty – the last remaining nuclear arms control treaty between Russia and the US – reducing mechanisms for strategic stability, communication and predictability and which could, potentially, pave the way to a resumption of nuclear testing. The war in Ukraine requires an updated way of thinking about how nuclear weapons interact with conventional crises and warfare and how they are being employed by Russia as a tool of coercion and behavioural signalling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IR2021 already developed the UK’s nuclear deterrence policy and doctrine towards an era of great power competition, including raising the cap on the UK’s overall weapon stockpile, reversing a trend of a decline in numbers since the Cold War, and posing a challenge in terms of its commitments under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. As a non-nuclear weapons power, the German contribution to the debate is naturally very different to the UK position and nuclear arms control is of great significance to Germany. It is heavily influenced by its commercial sector and there are differing views from inside the coalition government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An early Zeitenwende decision was to procure 35 F-35A, which allows Germany to continue to participate in the US nuclear sharing agreement, thereby clearly signalling continued Transatlanticism. However, Germany also participated as an observer in the first meeting of States Parties to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW). This reflects the priorities of maintaining alliance solidarity and maintaining a principled approach to disarmament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, strategic stability and risk reduction are interconnected, and the security environment has forced Europe to widen its sense of what risk reduction, including deterrence, involves. Moreover, Europe collectively needs more options to manage escalation. For such discussions, non-governmental fora are the safest ground to meet on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-10--dialogue-and-knowledge-sharing&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recommendation 10 – Dialogue and Knowledge Sharing&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The UK and Germany should establish a British-German nuclear dialogue with the objective of raising both the UK and Germany’s “nuclear IQ” and encouraging a more public debate on nuclear weapons and the nuclear threats increasingly posed by hostile state actors (Russia, China, Iran, North Korea), escalation, risk reduction and strategic stability, as well as the joint challenge of nuclear proliferation.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The UK and Germany should commit to developing new Confidence and Security Building Measures (CSBMs), within an OSCE framework, and adapt them to the needs of the 21st Century, accounting for new technologies and better protection of civilian populations.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chapter-four&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CHAPTER FOUR&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;uk-german-defence-and-security-operational-cooperation&quot;&gt;UK-GERMAN DEFENCE AND SECURITY OPERATIONAL COOPERATION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter assesses the practical opportunities for enhanced cooperation between the UK military and the Bundeswehr, and between the UK and German defence industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK military and the Bundeswehr have a long history and a deep cultural understanding which was gained through longstanding basing of UK troops in Germany. This is exemplified by the formation of the binational German-British Amphibious Engineer Battalion 130, which specialises in bridging capabilities. They have operated together in Kosovo, Afghanistan, Mali and cooperated in countering ISIS in Syria and Iraq, amongst numerous military exercises. Most recently, the RAF and Luftwaffe have flown joint NATO air policing missions over Estonia for the first time, including the interception of a Russian aircraft, as the UK takes over the NATO rotation from Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;defence-modernisation-and-readiness-for-warfighting&quot;&gt;DEFENCE MODERNISATION AND READINESS FOR WARFIGHTING&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within NATO, the UK and Germany both lead eFP multinational battlegroups, are vJTF framework nations, lead Framework Nations, and aspire to operate at divisional level. However, the UK and German militaries, especially their land forces, need to modernise quickly to live up to their current NATO commitments. Indeed, there is uncertainty over whether committed UK and German divisions will be available to NATO and ready on time. Following the war in Ukraine, both militaries have been accused of eroding their own warfighting capabilities with underinvestment and being distracted with expeditionary operations. There is even an odd similarity in the current Infantry Fighting vehicle (IFv) problems with the UK Ajax further delayed into service and significantly over budget, and the German Puma IFv experiencing multiple problems, including breaking down during exercise conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK and Germany are currently the first and second largest European defence spenders respectively. The 2020 UK spending review provided defence with an additional 16.5 billion pounds over a four-year settlement which was described as the “largest sustained increase in the core defence budget for 30 years”. Despite the war in Ukraine, the UK Spring Budget allocated only an additional 11 billion to the defence budget for 2027/28, which will mainly go to the capital budget. This places UK defence spending at 2.1 per cent with an aspiration to increase to 2.5 per cent when “fiscal conditions allow” and as part of a broader change to the NATO Defence Investment Pledge. However, these increases might still not be enough to transform the UK military, with the National Audit Office concluding that the Equipment Plan to 2031 is highly ambitious and that UK NATO commitments are in jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the war in Ukraine prompted larger increases in German defence spending. Despite the financial commitments of the Zeitenwende, Germany missed the 2022 two per cent GDP NATO target and is forecast to miss it in 2023 as well. The Bundeswehr is in a similar state following decades of underinvestment. Its return as a lever of national power and collective defence is now the number one priority and was a central part of the Zeitenwende speech, with Chancellor Scholz declaring “The goal is a powerful, cutting-edge, progressive Bundeswehr that can be relied upon to protect us”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite a cash injection and rising overall spending for the Bundeswehr, it is unlikely to be enough or truly transformational, especially with inflation and fluctuations in currency, for several reasons. First, the approach is based on capability retention through equipment modernisation by providing replacements for existing equipment and programmes, so no “new” capabilities will be delivered. Much will be absorbed by the procurement of basic military equipment such as helmets and night vision. Second, the special fund is based on a 2018 capability profile, not future requirements, which will largely be developed by analysing data from the war in Ukraine. Third, due to slow procurement processes, the contracts for the special fund are only just materialising, 12 months later, and are yet to have an impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-12--policy-and-dialogue-and-knowledge-sharing&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recommendation 12 – Policy and Dialogue and Knowledge Sharing&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The UK and Germany should lead a broader European debate on defence specialisation to make the most of their comparative advantages and build on work already undertaken in their respective NATO Framework Nations. While specialisation is not a new concept in European security, the war in Ukraine has revived it and created political and economic drivers, and a greater degree of unity and focus on European defence and security than past initiatives.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DEFENCE INDUSTRIAL COOPERATION AND CAPABILITIES&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2021 DCP specifically references the 40 years of cooperation between the UK and Germany on combat air and the desire to expand this to other areas such as land systems, space, and cyberspace. Bilaterally there is only one bilateral defence procurement project between the UK and Germany – the Wide Wet Gap Crossing project – which builds on joint development of bridging capabilities. There are currently eight multinational projects in the land, sea, and air domain. Moreover, there are multiple common or similar equipment programmes in each domain which are already developing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Organisation for Joint Armament Co-operation (OCCAR) model provides a highly effective framework for defence cooperation that the UK and Germany, as founding members, can base bilateral cooperation on. As the other joint European procurement programme is the European Defence Agency (EDA), OCCAR is currently the only realistic option for the UK, unless the UK is able to secure a deal with the EU for third party participation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-13--policy&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recommendation 13 – Policy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The UK and Germany should use the OCCAR framework as a foundation for joint procurement and use the tried and tested framework for any bilateral joint procurement projects identified.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the CEO of German defence company Hensoldt, the war in Ukraine has already transformed their business model, with demand so high that manufacturers can produce weapons without pre-orders. Operationally, the war in Ukraine has also reaffirmed the vital importance of common systems and their sustainability in production and logistic support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK and German industry is well placed to adapt to these changes and there is potential to strengthen their industrial capabilities through closer cooperation, though the war in Ukraine has not yet been decisive in this regard. To date, equipment cooperation has occurred largely by chance and has been arrived at independently. Any post-Ukraine revisions of UK and German industrial strategies would begin to enable more formal and structured cooperation. Moreover, if closer cooperation is to make a step change, the priority is to provide a political declaration to send a strong signal to UK and German industry to provide reassurance and build trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-14--political&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recommendation 14 – Political&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The UK and Germany should commit to a joint high-level statement to make the case for a cooperative strategy to industry, which outlines the associated benefits, to provide the demand signal to industry and best prepare them for any change of approach.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, political and structural differences will likely remain with system level cooperation limited due to diverging political and industrial preferences, with Germany favouring national or EU procurement and the UK favouring national or US imports. While this might improve, it is unlikely to change. Instead, focussing on a sub-system level could develop collaborative opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, in the air domain, cooperation is limited by the emerging cooperative plans of the UK-Italy-Japan trilateral Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP) and the Franco-German Future Combat Air System (FCAS) to produce sixth generation fighters. However, there is scope for cooperation at a sub-component level on Command, Control, Communications and Computers (C4), sensors, Electronic Warfare (EW), complex weapons and other systems which could be applied across programmes for system levels of co-operations, many of which are already highlighted in UK and German industrial strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-15--operational&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recommendation 15 – Operational&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The UK and Germany, as members of GCAP and FCAS respectively, should lead on identifying collaborative opportunities at a sub-component level and champion cooperation and commonality where possible.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Export controls, which caused a diplomatic problem between the UK and German in 2019 over UK exports of Eurofighter Typhoon, have come into sharper focus due to military support to Ukraine. Without strong communication and desire to mitigate and provide workarounds, arms export policies could continue to have repercussions for the European defence industry and be a significant roadblock to future cooperation. The earlier these issues are aligned the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-16--policy&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recommendation 16 – Policy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The UK and Germany should compare respective arms export policies and regimes in greater depth, including Parliamentary scrutiny, to create more standardised processes across Europe and increase export potential.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has also highlighted the importance of air and missile defence to protect military forces and civilian populations which has long been a European capability gap. The recent establishment of the German-led European Sky Shield Initiative (ESSI) seeks to establish a European air and missile defence system through common acquisition of interoperable and off-the-shelf solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-17--dialogue-and-knowledge-sharing&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recommendation 17 – Dialogue and Knowledge Sharing&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The UK and Germany, as heavyweights of cooperation in the European Sky Shield Initiative, should undertake analysis to enhance the initiative to move from joint procurement of common capabilities towards joint acquisition in order to understand future requirements and support NATOs Integrated Air and Missile Defence.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An early decision of the Zeitenwende was that the Bundeswehr will procure armed unmanned aerial vehicles (UAvs) for the first time, concluding a debate that began in 2012. The “drone” debate in Germany has been difficult and conflated with the US operation of drones and questions of autonomous killing. By mid-2024, the Heron TP drone, currently leased by Germany, will be armed, then replaced with the Eurodrone by 2032. In contrast, the UK has been operating armed UAvs for decades and has experience in integrating these into operational use across services and domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-18--dialogue-and-knowledge-sharing&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recommendation 18 – Dialogue and Knowledge Sharing&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The UK should establish a UAv knowledge sharing programme for a German audience on operating armed UAvs in conflicts, covering the full range of associated issues such as legality, ethics, targeting processes, collateral damage assessments, and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) handling for operators. This would allow the Bundeswehr to operationally integrate armed UAvs much more quickly.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Land cooperation is a growing area with joint experience on the Boxer programme, which will be enhanced through the new Boxer user group. Indeed, UK-German leadership on Boxer will be needed as rising demand starts to create supply bottlenecks. Moreover, both the UK and Germany are continuing to improve their MBTs, both using the L55A1 turret and developing standardised ammunition to enhance NATO interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, there are potential collaborative opportunities in developing long-range precision strike capabilities as the war in Ukraine has provided a stark demonstration of its military value and of current Russian vulnerabilities in this area. As European militaries develop their new doctrinal concepts and identify lessons from the war, it has provided a sharper focus, with knowledge sharing and joint procurement options, such as closer alignment for Germany with the UK’s Complex Weapons Programme or the UK with the German-Dutch Apollo Project on Ground-based air and missile defence. Part of land warfare development, and understanding warfighting lessons from Ukraine, is influenced by prototype warfare, integration, and doctrinal advancement, which is a leading area for the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-19--dialogue-and-knowledge-sharing&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recommendation 19 – Dialogue and Knowledge Sharing&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The UK should invite the Bundeswehr to visit, and potentially join, its Experimentation Battlegroup, based in Cyprus, which leads on prototype warfare and capability development for the British Army.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-2030-roadmap-for-enhanced-cooperation&quot;&gt;A 2030 Roadmap for Enhanced Cooperation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The transformative effect of the war in Ukraine has made enhanced UK-German defence and security, and foreign policy cooperation more attractive, viable, and necessary; and moreover, this period of joint policy development is the ideal moment to develop a more structural relationship. Enhanced UK-German cooperation should be focussed on helping to lead a European Pillar of NATO, rather than the ad hoc and transactional approach that has characterised the current relationship. The strategic approach to bilateral cooperation should focus on setting clear mutual goals and establishing the right mechanisms and processes for delivery, managed through the UK-German Strategic Dialogue or a more ambitious future agreement.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Germany and the UK should include Defence Ministers in the annual Strategic Dialogue and intensify regular dialogues between the Prime Minister and Chancellor to set the level of ambition and maintain political momentum. The two countries should also explore the potential for and content of a bilateral Treaty-based defence and security relationship. This agreement should build on work already undertaken through UK and German leadership of their respective Framework Nations Concepts and should focus on increasing European burden sharing and enhancing readiness of forces. They should commit to developing new Confidence and Security Building Measures, accounting for new technologies and better protection of civilian populations.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;They should use the OCCAR framework as a foundation for joint procurement and use the tried and tested framework for any bilateral joint procurement projects identified. The two countries should compare respective arms export policies and regimes in greater depth, including Parliamentary scrutiny, to create more standardised processes across Europe. Germany and the UK should implement measures for increased dialogue and knowledge sharing, such as the creation of liaison officers, the establishment of a British-German nuclear dialogue, and leading a broader European debate on defence specialisation.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;控方確認傳畢證人 押5.29就共謀者原則作法律陳詞 拘捕警認不知何謂「攬炒十步」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/C7z2xlD.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（16日）踏入審訊第58天。控方應何桂藍一方要求傳召警員盤問，其中拘捕何的警員曾向何指，有理由相信她參加初選目的在進入立會否決預算案，迫使特首辭職，以達成戴耀廷在《蘋果日報》及各大媒體提倡的「攬炒香港十步曲計劃」，惟同意當時沒有獲發戴的「攬炒十步」文章，亦不知道「攬炒十步」說什麼。此外，3名國安警供稱曾按提交物料令分別從《立場新聞》、《獨立媒體》和《蘋果日報》公司接收初選廣告相關文件，惟有警員承認沒看過該提交物料令，對相關資料也不清楚。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方確認已傳召所有證人，案件押至本月29日續審，以待控辯雙方呈交有關「共謀者原則」的法律陳詞，何桂藍一方亦會爭議匿名證人片段的呈堂性。法官李運騰指《國安法》沒有追溯力，關注共謀者原則是否適用於《國安法》生效前的言行、及後來加入串謀的被告，辯方透露將提交聯合書面陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;國安警稱從立場前總編接收提交物料令資料-涉民動廣告-惟認無看過提交令&quot;&gt;國安警稱從《立場》前總編接收「提交物料令」資料 涉民動廣告 惟認無看過提交令&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表彭卓棋的大律師盧敏儀甫開庭表示，上周確診的彭今早已轉為陰性，彭於正庭與其他被告同坐。至於施德來則仍在延伸庭就坐。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今應辯方要求傳召5名警員接受盤問，其中3人均與警方於2020年12月24日獲高院簽發提交物料令，要求《獨立媒體》、《立場新聞》和《蘋果日報》公司交出資料有關。其中偵緝警員13344黎啟東於2011年加入警隊，自2020年7月駐守國安處，供稱於2021年2月10日獲指示到警察總部，從《立場新聞》時任總編輯鍾沛權接收一份關於民主動力在《立場》投放廣告的20多頁文件，包括 WhatsApp 對話紀錄、電郵記錄和單據。黎其後與鍾簽收，並要求他就提交物料令落口供，但鍾拒絕。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 問，該份提交物料令是否於2020年12月24日獲得，黎稱「唔好意思我冇呢方面嘅資料啊當時」，並指他沒見過該提交物料令，不知是何時發給《立場》，也不知警方發出後有否與《立場》溝通，亦不清楚為何指明要提交自2020年6月9日起至12月24日的資料。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;國安警稱從獨立媒體及蘋果日報接收資料-有警認不清楚提交物料令資料&quot;&gt;國安警稱從《獨立媒體》及《蘋果日報》接收資料 有警認不清楚提交物料令資料&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於偵緝警員12131王錫輝，於2010年加入警隊，自2020年7月駐守國安處。他同意於2021年2月25日，有律師樓文員為《蘋果日報》和壹傳媒向他按提交物料令交出文件和一隻DVD，內含約200頁文件，包括吳政亨的「三投三不投」頭版廣告和初選投票日的網上廣告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在 Beel 盤問下，黃指「有關提交物料令嘅資料，其實我係唔清楚嘅」，指他僅於當天早上獲指示於相關時間到灣仔警署接收文件，事前「我係唔知道自己會收到咩文件，但知道同35+初選案件有關」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於偵緝警員12381梁晉榮，於2010年加入警隊，自2020年7月駐守國安處，並獲委任為本案調查警員。他確認2021年1月12日在警察總部，接收由獨立媒體董事黃俊邦按提交物料令交出的12頁資料。與上兩名警員不同，作為本案調查警員的梁，盤問下指看過該提交物料令，知道是同年1月6日向獨立媒體發出，但不清楚為何列明要取得自2020年6月9日起的資料，指「呢個唔係我考慮範圍」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;國安警稱從圖書館及報刊辦-搜2019年6月至2020年8月戴耀廷報章文章&quot;&gt;國安警稱從圖書館及報刊辦 搜2019年6月至2020年8月戴耀廷報章文章&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;梁晉榮亦負責取得和保存戴耀廷在報章發表的文章。梁表示於2021年4月8日，警員12656從公共圖書館借來276份從2019年6月至2020年8月的《蘋果日報》，他檢視後選取47份包含戴耀廷發表的文章，進行影印和掃描，其中19篇為控方證物；梁同年4月15日再從電影、報刊及物品辦事處取得一篇《蘋果日報》和兩篇《明報》的文章，包括〈35+已超額完成〉及〈中共對港的戰略及戰術〉。他確認上述文章與他理解戴就35+的概念相符。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問到，梁搜證時有否特定的文章列表，抑或只是搜尋戴耀廷的文章。梁指沒有特定列表，而是知道戴會於網上發文，亦相信他會在《蘋果日報》或《明報》刊登，故到報刊辦和公共圖書館，按2019年的年中到年尾至2020年初選舉行的時限搜尋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 指，除了文章作者顯示為「戴耀廷」，梁並不知道戴實際上是文章作者。梁同意「冇辦法確認」，但認為戴在 Facebook 和記者會的發言，與他文章言論是「大致吻合」。法官陳仲衡問，他是否察覺戴曾投訴《蘋果日報》或《明報》發表冒用他名字的文章，梁指沒有，並指「好多時佢（戴）Facebook 都轉載返呢啲文章」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;國安警指因有藍剔故信是何桂藍fb-官質疑盤問意義-辯方稱獲指示要求嚴格舉證&quot;&gt;國安警指因有藍剔故信是何桂藍FB 官質疑盤問意義 辯方稱獲指示要求嚴格舉證&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;餘下兩人涉何桂藍的案情。其中警長5820梁樂文負責網上蒐證，他2006年加入警隊，自2020年7月駐守國安處，2021年1月升為警長。梁供稱，由於何桂藍是35+初選的其中一個參選人，故在「Google」搜尋「何桂藍」，何的 Facebook 專頁「何桂藍 Gwyneth Ho」為第一個結果，他進入後以「鄧奇」的帳戶將與初選有關的帖文截圖，包括「墨落無悔」聲明、何宣傳謝票的街站和轉發她在《洛杉磯時報》的文章，均於2020年8月截圖。法官陳慶偉一度問Beel 是否挑戰以上證供，Beel 回應他獲指示要求控方嚴格舉證（put to straight proof）。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在 Beel 盤問下，梁確認就何桂藍而言，只就此 Facebook 專頁截圖。被問截圖準則，梁指與35+初選案相關就有需要；至於如何得知確實是何的專頁，梁指因看到何的名字後有藍剔，故有理由相信是何使用的帳號。他在法官追問下亦指，對何公開表達的想法「大概有少少認知」，而何的帖文與之吻合，他亦比對過何的相片與專頁吻合。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 完成盤問後，陳慶偉指老實說看不到挑戰相關證供的意義。Beel 指不爭議該些證供本身，只是獲當事人指示就相關證供要求嚴格舉證。法官李運騰指明白他的難處，但若何桂藍其後選擇作供，她也會被問到相關 Facebook 帖文，Beel 重申只是嘗試跟隨當事人指示，他不爭議證物的真確性（authenticity）。陳慶偉指相信 Beel 已向何講述挑戰這些證供的後果。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;警拘捕時指初選目的在達成戴耀廷攬炒十步曲計劃-惟認無獲發文章亦不知是說什麼&quot;&gt;警拘捕時指初選目的在達成戴耀廷攬炒十步曲計劃 惟認無獲發文章亦不知是說什麼&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;負責拘捕何桂藍的偵緝警員18834黃柏烽其後作供，他2014年加入警隊，2021年1月6日駐守新界北總區反黑組。在 Beel 盤問下，他同意當天早上獲警長羅振威（音譯）訓示，稍後會就一宗顛覆國家政權案進行拘捕行動，並按照羅手上文件的內容去進行拘捕，涉及要向被捕人說的話及拘捕原因。黃指當時由探員1080負責處理證物，印象中獲口頭指示要檢取電子儀器，其他則沒印象。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續引述黃的口供，指他拘捕時曾向何桂藍表示：「我而家拉你，罪名係顛覆國家政權罪。因為我有理由相信你喺2020年期間參選一個名為『35+公民投票』嘅初選活動，選出35名或以上初選勝出者，進入立法會議會，目的在於否決政府嘅任何財政預算案或議案，從而迫使行政長官辭職。呢一個行為，在於達成戴耀廷在《蘋果日報》及各大媒體上所提倡嘅『攬炒香港十步曲』計劃，旨在嚴重干擾、阻撓及破壞香港特別行政區政權機關依法履行職能。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃同意，進行拘捕時獲發有上述內容的文件，Beel 問除此之外，他當時還有其他與「攬炒十步」有關的文件嗎？李運騰追問，他當時有否獲提供該「攬炒十步」文章？黃指沒有。Beel 追問，「你當時是否知道這（「攬炒十步」）是關於什麼？（“At that time did you understand what that matter is about?”）」，陳慶偉亦糾正翻譯問：「嗰陣時你知唔知講緊乜嘢嘢？」黃答：「唔知道。」Beel 問，因此若何桂藍問到，他也不能回答？黃同意，亦同意他要請示上級才能回答，不過何桂藍當時沒有問。Beel 表示已完成盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;吳政亨與控方達成新一份同意事實-指曾以李伯盧網名於連登發帖&quot;&gt;吳政亨與控方達成新一份同意事實 指曾以「李伯盧」網名於連登發帖&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，代表吳政亨的大律師石書銘指吳與控方達成新一份同意事實，望能節省傳召兩名證人的時間。庭上讀出該份同意事實，提及吳2021年1月被捕後被警員11632檢取手機，內有與戴耀廷的 WhatsApp 紀錄；而吳的 Instagram 帳號為「@LEEBAKLOU」，與「@legcopetition」相關，吳並曾以「李伯盧」網名於2020年7月17日在連登討論區發表帖文「N之内係正選 N之外係後備 就係咁簡單」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方確認已傳所有證人-尚餘共謀者原則及證人x片段呈堂性爭議&quot;&gt;控方確認已傳所有證人 尚餘共謀者原則及證人X片段呈堂性爭議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方確認已傳召所有證人，並指目前有新一份同意事實。陳慶偉問還有多少份，控方指尚有一份在傳閱，法官着該兩份稍後再一同讀出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;主控周天行確認，控方案情將完結，但此前尚要處理「共謀者原則（co-conspirator’s rule）」的法律爭議，以及 Trevor Beel 就證人X錄影和錄音檔案呈堂性的爭議。控辯雙方同意，就 Beel 的呈堂性爭議，他會於下周一（22日）提交書面陳詞，控方於周四（25日）書面回應；至於共謀者原則的爭議，控方同於22日提交書面陳詞，辯方於25日書面回應，並於5月29日開庭進行法律爭議，預計同日處理剩餘的同意事實。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉一度指，在29日前他們可休息，Beel 指他們會在工作而非休息，李運騰則笑說法庭有其他事務要處理，沒有餘裕放長假。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官關注共謀者原則是否適用於國安法前言行及後來加入的被告&quot;&gt;官關注共謀者原則是否適用於《國安法》前言行及後來加入的被告&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表林卓廷和黃碧雲的大律師沈士文其後表示，辯方團隊正在協調，將就共謀者原則為法庭提供一份聯合書面陳詞，主要法律理據是《國安法》只在2020年7月1日生效，沒有追溯力；個別被告亦會針對其案情提交陳詞。根據該原則，各共謀者的言行均可用來指證所有被告，而控方早前指並非本案被告的蔡澤鴻、黎敬輝和郭榮鏗均是本案共謀者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/b2e6Kfm.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 黃碧雲&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指理解《國安法》並無追溯力，而本案爭議點是共謀者在《國安法》2020年6月30日生效前的言行，是否可納為共謀者原則下的證據。沈回應將就此引用16個案例，並重申《國安法》無追溯力，問題是普通法下的共謀者原則會否被《國安法》所影響。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指，假設共謀者原則適用，尚要考慮被告在加入串謀前，其他共謀者所作的言行能否用來指證他，因被告於不同時間加入串謀。沈回應，不少案例均支持原先共謀者的言行並不會影響後來加入的人。陳慶偉最後指，就共謀者原則做決定後，辯方才可說明是否要求毋須答辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件押至5月29日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

What would it take to make them fit for current and future challenges?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;executive-summary&quot;&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report is part of the CSIS project Transforming European Defense. The goal of the project is to leverage the strengths of CSIS in political-military analysis and defense industry engagement to create a plan of action to rationalize European defense. It will develop specific recommendations for European policymakers to reduce inefficiencies and seek creative joint endeavors for European security. The project also develops recommendations for actionable initiatives that U.S. policymakers can engage with and push European allies to implement. This project thus seeks to impact policy on both sides of the Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the war in Ukraine has put the emphasis on land warfare and the importance of controlling the skies, the naval dimension should not be overlooked. Strategic competitors’ fleets are growing in numbers, in tonnage, and in sophistication, and they increasingly contest maritime borders as well as international laws and customs applicable to the maritime domain. Faced with overlapping challenges, European navies are plagued by a number of issues such as poor availability of assets, lack of combat readiness, aging platforms, fragmentation, and insufficient coordination. This report outlines the main threats and challenges that Europeans face at sea and details the gaps in capabilities before providing recommendations for how to fill those gaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Cold War became history, so did the prospect of conventional conflict at sea against a peer competitor — or so most Western capitals believed. The post–Cold War peace dividend ushered in decades of dwindling investment in naval capabilities and a refocus on low-end missions for Western nations. This contrasted with a massive naval investment by yet-to-become rivals, China and Russia. As Europeans awaken to a new era of strategic competition, they now face a highly threatening maritime environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategic competitors’ fleets are growing in numbers, in tonnage, and in sophistication; further, there is a proliferation of advanced missiles, sensors, and autonomous weapons, along with the application of disruptive technologies such as cyber and artificial intelligence (AI). A more assertive China is now at the helm of one of the largest navies in the world. The war in Ukraine has so far left Russia’s naval capabilities largely untouched. In addition to a buildup of capabilities, strategic competitors increasingly contest maritime borders as well as international laws and customs applicable to the maritime domain. Once unfathomable, modern naval warfare is now not so distant or unlikely of a prospect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the war in Ukraine has put the emphasis on land warfare and the importance of controlling the skies, the naval dimension should not be overlooked. In the first weeks of the conflict, Russia quickly moved to block Ukrainian ports, laid sea mines, deployed its nuclear submarines, and effectively launched Kalibr missile strikes from the sea. Subsequent missile, drone, and autonomous vessel attacks by Ukraine on Russian forces — as well as decisions by Turkey to restrict access to the Bosporus Strait and the Dardanelles — have considerably hampered Russian maneuvers, showing the importance of controlling key choke points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe has an economy equivalent in size to the United States or China, and its members combined have the largest exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the world. More than 75 percent of European imports enter by sea and 99 percent of its data is provided through undersea cables, while Europe’s navies and shipping firms rely on free navigation. Europe is therefore a global economic power with immense interest in maintaining free and open seas and respect for international maritime laws and norms, whether in the Indo-Pacific, the Mediterranean, the Baltic, or the Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet maritime security is now affected by challenges of increasing diversity and intensity. Unfortunately, the state of European navies is largely consistent with the broader state of European defense. Europe’s navies have suffered underinvestment for years, if not decades. The European naval landscape amounts to patchy, isolated, and often unconcerted national efforts. European navies are plagued by a number of issues such as poor availability of assets, lack of combat readiness, aging platforms, fragmentation, and insufficient coordination. Should a scenario of high-intensity warfare arise, European navies would likely be underequipped and underprepared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shown by the EU Strategic Compass and NATO’s Strategic Concept, Europeans are aware of the need to step up to this new strategic environment. Additionally, navies continue to play a vital diplomatic role, whether in the form of ship visits, naval exercises, or freedom of navigation operations. These activities send important messages to allies and partners — as well as to adversaries — about Europe’s strength, its dependability, and its resolve. Conversely, Europe’s lack of naval capacity means that Europe struggles to ensure the necessary level of presence at sea, undercutting its broader diplomatic standing. As Europe focuses on rebuilding its armies and air forces for a Russia contingency, it cannot neglect the naval domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But maintaining a strong naval capacity is a resource-intensive effort, and it comes at a time when every segment of Europe’s militaries calls for renewed investments, putting strain on still limited budgets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European navies are facing several dilemmas. They must deal simultaneously with increased security threats along their shores and the need to increase their presence further away in order to protect sea lines of communication, their key interests, and the interests of their partners abroad, all of which can take them very far from their territory. Currently, due to its shrinking naval capacity, Europe has difficulties ensuring a permanent presence at sea in critical areas, particularly in the Indo-Pacific. It must invest in high-end capabilities to stand up to key competitors, but European countries also cannot afford to relinquish their assets for coast guard functions or neglect daily issues that can disrupt their vital supplies or could result in humanitarian catastrophe. There is a danger, as focus goes to rebuilding Europe’s armies, air forces, and missile defense capacities, that European navies will be deprived of investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, this report explores ways to rationalize efforts to adapt European navies to this new and fast-evolving environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;threats-in-the-maritime-domain&quot;&gt;Threats in the Maritime Domain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Increasingly Intense and Diverse&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While strategic competition on and below the seas is shaping maritime security, lower-end issues such as piracy, migration, and organized crime at sea have not disappeared — quite the contrary. These challenges are compounded by the effects of climate change and overfishing, which have evolved into the top concerns in some areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strategic-competition-at-sea&quot;&gt;Strategic Competition at Sea&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Powers aspiring to contest the world order are investing massively in their navies, equipping their warships with more diverse, advanced, and complex combat systems to gain a capability edge. They simultaneously call into question the laws, rules, and practices applicable to the maritime domain. The increased propensity for uninhibited aggression in sea lines of communication vital for Europe has been underlined by naval “incidents” such as the Iranian attacks on tankers in the Gulf in 2019 or some tense encounters in the eastern Mediterranean and the Black Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RUSSIA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin has long sought to counterbalance the perceived superiority of its peers in terms of tonnage, number of ships, and force projection capabilities. The navy of the Russian Federation (Voyenno-morskoiflot, VMF) has developed highly capable submarines (such as the recently commissioned Project 08851 Yasen-M SSGN and Project 955A Borey-A SSBN) and powerful offensive missile systems with nuclear-tipped torpedo capability. Although it lost its Black Sea flagship — the Slava-class surface ship Moskva — two months into the conflict in Ukraine (the first destruction of a major warship in combat since the British frigate Sheffield during the Falklands war 40 years ago), the VMF is the only corps of the Russian armed forces that remains largely untouched by the war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/TWMpUY7.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: The Russian Threat Axis.&lt;/strong&gt; Note: The threat axis (defined by the red dashed lines) show the routes that NATO and the European Union will need to monitor for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. This will provide critical warnings and indicators of Russia’s maritime activities. Source: Authors’ research and analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, it plans significant additions in the coming years, as it is working on the Surrogate-W unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) and on modernizing the fleet’s anti-ship missile capabilities through a process known as “Kalibrisation”: the widespread equipment of 3M14 Kalibr cruise missiles on a variety of vessels. This adds to the 3M22 Zircon hypersonic cruise missile, which is still in development and allegedly capable of Mach 9 speeds with a 1,000 km range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The VMF is therefore set to evolve as the most critical naval threat to Europeans, with its ability to pose strategic dilemmas, to employ an anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) strategy, and to eventually engage in naval warfare with significant symmetric and asymmetric assets. However, it is unclear whether Russia will be able to maintain its modernization plans. Russia will likely prioritize the war in Ukraine, limiting the availability of certain assets like missiles. Its defense industries might also struggle to access or replace Western parts and components critical to its naval modernization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHINA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has built a modern navy at great speed and now operates the largest navy in the world (in terms of number of ships, not tonnage, in which it remains second to the United States). Contrary to Europeans, the investment in modern capabilities for the People’s Liberation Army Navy has been underway for more than 25 years. It now possesses three aircraft carriers and has been moving rapidly to fill a gap in amphibious capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the U.S. Department of Defense, the overall battle force of China’s navy is expected to grow to 400 ships by 2025 and 440 ships by 2030 (compared to 290 for the United States by 2030), along with 5 aircraft carriers and 10 ballistic missile subs. China’s military modernization effort is aimed at asserting Chinese claims in what Beijing perceives as its hinterland: Taiwan and near-seas regions, particularly the South China Sea. This alone has the potential to affect Europeans, as it would give China leverage over key sea lanes of communication — 30 percent of global trade goes through the South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Challenges posed by China are not limited to the Indo-Pacific. Beijing is also developing vessels capable of sailing far from its shores (a “blue-water navy”). It established in 2017 its first overseas military base in Djibouti, on the Horn of Africa. It simultaneously invests in dual-use infrastructures on key sea lanes of communication along its Belt and Road Initiative and in important ports in Europe (Piraeus, Hamburg), potentially developing facilities that China can use to conduct activities running counter to European interests (from espionage to navigation disruptions). Chinese navy ships are also conducting an increasing number of operations in the waters surrounding Europe, including the Mediterranean Sea and the Baltic Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NORTH KOREA, IRAN, AND OTHERS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other countries overtly challenge the international rules-based order and have also invested in their naval capabilities. The North Korean navy is tied to the nuclear program via Kim Jong-un’s personalized push for a submarine-based second-strike capability. It maintains one of the world’s largest submarine fleets, with estimates ranging from between 60 and 80 vessels, although these are mostly coastal and aging. It cooperates actively with China — notably because the navy plays a preeminent role in fishing, a sector in which Beijing’s interests are enmeshed with those of the Korean peninsula. The Islamic Republic of Iran has embraced a hybrid strategy combining conventional naval power — including capability buildup, such as the delivery of its Shahid Soleimani catamaran missile corvette in 2022 — and asymmetric warfare through thousands of heavily armed speedboats or sabotage activities against commercial vessels or offshore energy infrastructures. It has also instituted joint drills with Russia in the northern Indian Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KEY CHOKE POINTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategic competition at sea is also defined to a large extent by the ability to control critical sea lines of communication and key choke points. Control of the Bosporous Strait is a major asset: for example, during the war in Ukraine, Turkey implemented Article 19 of the 1936 Montreux Convention, restricting warships from accessing the Black Sea. In this regard, the Suez Canal and the Strait of Hormuz are major Achilles’ heels for European countries, especially as rivals and competitors are trying to get footholds in the northern Indian Ocean, through which transits half of the value of the trade between the European Union and Asia. This underlines the importance of relations with countries such as Egypt and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The regional situation in the eastern Mediterranean is also extremely volatile, with competing claims over resources and EEZs opposing all littoral countries (Turkey, Cyprus, Greece, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Egypt, and Libya). Although there have been some diplomatic breakthroughs — such as the agreement between Lebanon and Israel through U.S.-led, French-supported efforts — the majority of maritime boundaries in this region are not demarcated, and those that have been agreed bilaterally are contested by other countries in the area. Renewed tensions could therefore arise, as the situation frustrates the exploration, exploitation, and commercialization potential deriving from the substantial hydrocarbon resources present in this part of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkey, although a NATO ally, has repeatedly provoked diplomatic or security incidents in recent years with other European allies and EU members in the eastern Mediterranean. Turkey has a revisionist vision of its own maritime environment, encapsulated in its Mavi Vatan (“Blue Homeland”) doctrine developed by admirals of Turkey’s navy. It lays claims on a continental plateau and EEZs that are also claimed by Cyprus and Greece; this is exemplified by the agreement with Libya’s Government of National Accord in 2019 to establish a common maritime border, encroaching on Greece’s claimed EEZ. The matter is compounded by the large presence of hydrocarbons in disputed areas, leading Turkey to conduct illegal exploration and drilling — in which operating ships are escorted by Turkish military vessels — as part of a broader pattern of aggressive and assertive behavior at sea to advance its interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With new routes and economic opportunities arising from the receding of Arctic ice, the High North is also set to be increasingly disputed. Russia released a new Maritime Doctrine in July 2022 that presents the region as its most important focus, pledging to protect its waters “by all means.” This includes the introduction of new missile capabilities for its Northern Fleet, an increasing number of exercises, and the buildup of the largest icebreakers fleet, some of which are Kalibr-capable. Russia’s combined A2/AD and new offensive capabilities increase the vulnerability of the Greenland-Iceland-UK gap and expose neighboring Arctic countries such as Norway or Finland. In any NATO-Russia conflict, protecting this sea lane — and therefore the maritime link between North America and Europe — will be vital to the alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europeans also have increasing stakes in the Indo-Pacific, as the region is key for the future of Europe’s prosperity and security. Some countries have direct interests in the region, such as France through its overseas territories and its permanent military bases in both the Indian and Pacific Oceans; others are less directly concerned but acknowledge it as the epicenter of strategic and systemic competition as well as the top priority for their key ally, the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Ekf271j.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Soldiers of the Naval Special Forces Command take part in a boarding demonstration on board a frigate during the inaugural visit of the German defence minister to the German navy (Deutsche Marine) at the naval base in Eckernförde, northern Germany, on February 21, 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent years have seen an unprecedented concentration of European warships in the region, including from “non-usual suspects” such as Germany with its Bayern frigate historical voyage across the region or the Royal Netherlands Navy frigate Evertsen in support of the UK-led Carrier Strike Group in 2021. The geographical immensity of the area and an array of further challenges will represent a litmus test for European assets’ availability and projectability. As emphasized by the simultaneous, uncoordinated announcement of the AUKUS security partnership and the EU Indo-Pacific strategy on September 15, 2021, there are strategic dilemmas for European countries between aligning on U.S. interests and policies in the region or charting an alternative, autonomous path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NON-STATE FACTORS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, piracy and criminality at sea (armed robbery, kidnapping of seafarers, bunkering, etc.) have not disappeared. Hotspots and methods are constantly evolving: while the northern Indian Ocean was the main nest of piracy in the 2010s, notably off the coasts of Somalia, the numbers of attacks has constantly decreased in the region (from 200 in 2011 to only a handful in recent years) with the aid of European action through EU Naval Force (EUNAVFOR) Operation Atalanta, which began in 2008. The new piracy hotbed in the past few years has been the Gulf of Guinea, while high rates of criminality at sea remain in areas such as the Caribbean or the Malacca Strait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, largely driven by Chinese and Asian demand that induces fisheries to look for resources further afield, is also an increasing source of tensions. By depleting fish stocks, it can have a dramatic impact for some local communities that heavily rely on products from the sea for their daily needs (such as those in the Gulf of Guinea, the southern Indian Ocean, or Southeast Asia).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illegal migrations by sea, human trafficking, and smuggling also take a heavy toll: First, in human lives, with deaths in the thousands each year on migrants’ routes to Europe (over 3,000 in 2021). Second, by mobilizing important assets, as well as human and financial resources. Third, because migration disputes can divide Europe and create unease over how to handle the issue, as shown by recurring tensions between France and the United Kingdom over English Channel crossings or between Italy and France over migration rescue operations at sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasingly, climate change transforms maritime spaces and is a threat multiplier. If climate adaptation and coastal protection efforts fail by 2100, approximately 48 percent of the world’s land area, 52 percent of the global population, and 46 percent of global socioeconomic infrastructures and activities are at risk of flooding. It also results in a growing number of natural disasters, requiring navies to invest in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief assets and operational knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, critical infrastructures at sea are increasingly targeted, as part of hybrid attacks aiming at harming European interests while remaining under the threshold that could trigger a collective response from NATO or the European Union. Energy platforms or undersea cables that are key to the European economy are particularly vulnerable, as shown by the sabotage of Nord Stream pipelines or the mysterious rupture of submarine fiber-optic cables near France and the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These challenges and threats are increasingly severe and diverse, and tackling them all at once is an immense task that creates some dilemmas for European navies. First, they must choose between giving priority to high-end or low-end capacities. Second, there is a tension between focusing on protecting Europe’s shores and surroundings and venturing further away, be it to actively protect key sea lines of communication, to defend the rules-based order, or to appear as credible security providers for partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report argues that European countries do not have the luxury to choose their threats. They should therefore seek ways to rationalize their collective efforts and capitalize on each other’s assets, as well as those of their partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-european-naval-landscape&quot;&gt;The European “Naval Landscape”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Turning the Tide&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between 2000 and 2020, European navies retired a third of their main surface combatants (frigates and destroyers), bringing the fleets to their smallest size in recent history. European countries are now reinvesting, with a view to high-intensity warfare at sea. This includes investments in surface combatants, amphibious vessels, and submarines (see Table 1 below), but it also involves boosting their capacity for logistics, surveillance, and long-range strike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, such capabilities are difficult to develop in the short term due to their technical complexity, long lead times to delivery, and costs. Each country strikes a balance between deploying low-end military capabilities for daily security tasks on the one hand and developing high-end war-fighting capabilities for worst-case scenarios on the other. The following section outlines an overview of priorities, and some capabilities, of the main European navies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE ONLY TWO NUCLEAR, EXPEDITIONARY NAVIES ABLE TO ASSEMBLE COALITIONS: FRANCE AND THE UNITED KINGDOM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France and the United Kingdom are currently the two most important European navies — and they will remain so, considering their investment plans. Their navies share very similar features, being the only two operating nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines for nuclear deterrence and attack submarines able to launch conventionally armed land-attack cruise missiles. They have unique deployment capacity and experience among Europeans, sustained by the possession of overseas territories as well as a wide network of partner nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their strained bilateral relationship over Brexit — which, in the naval domain, culminated in the AUKUS episode which scrapped a monumental submarine deal between France and Australia — has stalled the cooperation between the two neighbors. There is hope, however, that announcements at the March 2023 summit between Emmanuel Macron and Rishi Sunak give new impetus to the relationship. The leaders pledged to fully harness the potential of the Combined Joint Expeditionary Force (a common deployable force that reached its full operational capacity in 2020) to move forward regarding the joint development of the future cruise/anti-ship weapons (FC/ASW) and to coordinate carriers’ deployments “to provide complementary and more persistent European presence in regions of shared interest.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;France:&lt;/strong&gt; The French navy (Marine Nationale) is the only national maritime force besides that of the United States to operate a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, as well as the only European navy to include a catapult-equipped carrier. It has a significant surface combatant fleet, but its vessels are stretched thin over the second-largest EEZ in the world and multiple operational engagements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key priorities for France include contributing to nuclear deterrence through its strategic submarine fleet and nuclear-capable embarked aircraft, protecting France’s sovereignty at sea and in its EEZ (mainly located in the Indo-Pacific), and maintaining power projection capabilities. The navy’s budget is dedicated to large-scale procurement programs such as the next-generation nuclear aircraft carrier to replace the Charles de Gaulle. Commissioning is expected in 2038 and is set to feature an angled light deck and up to three electromagnetic aircraft launch systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France also plans the purchase of six Suffren-class Barracuda nuclear attack submarines (SSN) and five FTI medium-sized frigates, and it has recently received six of its eight — and last — European multi-mission frigates (FREMM). Overall, France is planning to have 15 frontline frigates and destroyers by 2030. France also plans to upgrade 18 maritime patrol aircraft (ATL2s) and three out of five La Fayette frigates. Several of France’s largest, most expensive procurement programs, such as the FC/ASW missile system and a new generation of strategic nuclear submarines, will not be delivered until after 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The United Kingdom:&lt;/strong&gt; London aims to meet its stated ambition of “restoring Britain’s position as the foremost naval power in Europe.” The Royal Navy calls for a doubling in shipbuilding investment over the next five years. The United Kingdom has the ambition to operate its two 65,000 metric ton carriers simultaneously and maintain the United Kingdom’s continuous deterrence posture at sea, increasing the number of deployments at sea by fifth-generation F-35 combat aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the surface fleet, the plan is to increase the frigate fleet from 19 to 24 by the mid-2030s with upgraded versions of the Type-31 and Type-32 frigates and Type-45 destroyer as well as a newly launched Type-26 frigate. The 2022 National Shipbuilding Strategy outlines a pipeline of close to 150 new naval and civil vessels over 30 years. While the United Kingdom plans to invest in a range of new weapons — including air- and sea-launched long-range, anti-ship cruise missiles — these will only enter service after 2030. The United Kingdom is also regenerating its fixed-wing maritime-patrol aircraft capability, essential to protect the nuclear deterrent. Through the AUKUS security partnership with the United States and Australia, the United Kingdom will help develop the SSN-AUKUS for Australia, which will be based upon their next-generation SSN design and will be built and deployed by both Australia and the United Kingdom. Building is expected to start before the end of this decade, for a delivery in the late 2030s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WORLD-CLASS NAVIES: ITALY, GERMANY, SPAIN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Italy:&lt;/strong&gt; The Italian navy (Marina Militare) is one of the most important contributors to NATO and EU efforts in the Mediterranean Sea. The EUNAVFOR-MED Irini Operation is headquartered in Rome, while the U.S. Navy 6th Fleet is based in Naples. Italy operates the Cavour flagship with a carrier wing for F-35Bs, making it the only one in the European Union to have a carrier strike group equipped with fifth-generation aircraft. Below the surface, the backbone of the Italian navy is the four German-Italian Type-212A submarines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Marina Militare is planning to acquire new combat systems that will increase its potential for naval warfare, starting with long-range strike capabilities in the form of cruise missiles fitted onto frigates, destroyers, and submarines. Among the navy’s most important priorities is to strengthen its anti-submarine capabilities, in view of the underwater environment becoming more congested in the Mediterranean. It has therefore ordered two U212 Near Future Submarines. The Multi-Year Programming Document for 2022–2024 also outlines the plans to launch de-risking studies for the two next-generation destroyers (dubbed DDX) to replace the navy’s two Durand de la Penne–class units by 2028. This is only if sufficient funding can be provided. According to the navy, the blurring of the domains’ boundaries requires a new concept for naval combat, which was outlined in some detail by the Future Combat Naval System 2035 in Multi-Domain Operations (FCNS 2035) concept. However, the Marina Militare remains in an early stage regarding sea-based unmanned platforms, as it operates only a modest number of small shipborne unmanned aerial vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Germany:&lt;/strong&gt; While the post–World War II German navy has been mostly dedicated to the protection of German seas and NATO missions, it has recently extended its actions and ambitions, contributing to EU Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) operations in the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean and sending frigates to the Indo-Pacific. Germany boasts the largest number of naval auxiliaries but is far behind the other major European navies in terms of combatant vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the “Zeitenwende” context, the air force and land army will likely be given greater priority. Yet the German navy’s current defense plan includes major investments in new anti-submarine aircraft as well as more combat support ships, including frigates, five corvettes, two submarines, and mine-laying capabilities. Germany also plans to equip its frigates with anti-submarine warfare technologies. It has purchased submarines in partnership with Norway and it is pursuing a deal with India to jointly build six conventional submarines. Concerning its main weapons system, the navy is producing a replacement for its aging Harpoon stock: Kongsberg Naval Strike Missiles. The navy is also working towards acquiring a submarine-based missile, while the so-called Interactive Defence and Attack System for Submarines (IDAS) has been under development for many years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spain:&lt;/strong&gt; Once world-straddling, Spain’s navy (Armada Española) is now modest in size and capabilities, and it very much depends on international operations to maintain its capacity to deploy overseas. It leads EU operation Atalanta, headquartered in Rota since 2019. In 2020, Spain joined the European Patrol Corvette project under the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) scheme aimed at developing corvettes that can serve missions performed by offshore patrol boats and light frigates. In addition to the new Isaac Peral submarine class (S-81), the Spanish navy is expected to receive five F110-class multi-mission frigates by 2031. With looming budgets, however, Spain is likely to find it difficult to support its wide range of capabilities at current spending levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OTHER ROBUST EUROPEAN NAVIES: THE NETHERLANDS, DENMARK, GREECE, NORWAY, PORTUGAL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Netherlands:&lt;/strong&gt; The Netherlands will replace the aging Walrus-class submarines to maintain its high-demand submarine capability within NATO and the European Union. The Royal Netherlands Navy is also upgrading two of its four air defense and command frigates, which should be equipped with a new, more advanced surface-to-surface missile to replace the Harpoon. The Netherlands has also conducted national guidelines for maritime engagement in the Indo-Pacific. The country has an advanced domestic defense industry, including for naval ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greece:&lt;/strong&gt; Athens’ plans for its navy are mainly oriented by Turkey’s growing military posture in the Aegean Sea. The Greek government has approved a multibillion-dollar project to modernize the naval forces. This includes the purchase of three Belharra frigates. Greece has an extensive defense industry focused on the domestic market, capable of manufacturing and developing naval vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Denmark:&lt;/strong&gt; Denmark’s economy relies heavily on the seas and the country boasts the world’s largest container shipping company through the APM Maersk group. The Royal Danish Navy (Sørværnet) is notable for operating the Absalon-class support ship, which is unique for combining the features of a frigate and a landing platform dock. The Danish Ministry of Defence plans to strengthen by investing in new warships. The Iver Huitfeldt–class frigates (also known as the lead ship in the three-ship class of the Royal Danish Navy) have been upgraded with ballistic missile defense and integrated air and defense capabilities.44 In partnership with Finland, Denmark also seeks to improve future mine-laying solutions based on existing capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Norway:&lt;/strong&gt; The Norwegian Fleet is composed of several types of vessels, including frigates, submarines, minesweepers, and service vessels. Some of the major project activities in the upcoming period are the replacement of the current ULA-class submarines with 212CD-class submarines in partnership with Germany and the order of additional Kongsberg fifth-generation naval missiles that represent the navy’s main weapon against surface ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Portugal:&lt;/strong&gt; Maritime security is one of the key tasks of Portugal’s armed forces. The Portuguese navy (Marinha Portuguesa) aims to strengthen its means of surveillance by 2029, with the purchase of six new ocean patrol vessels in addition to the four that are already in service. The Portuguese navy has also launched a new drone mothership project, also known as a multifunctional naval platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sweden:&lt;/strong&gt; Sweden has an active naval shipbuilding industry, able to produce conventional submarines. It has embraced amphibious capabilities for small-scale, special operations forces insertion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE EUROPEAN UNION AND NATO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two main supranational organizations in charge of European security play a key role in supporting the synchronization and coordination of European navies’ agendas and strategies — a purpose they unevenly fulfill. As in other domains, the two organizations also face the issue of avoiding duplications and finding useful complementarities. They will also increasingly seek to be the prime venue to coordinate European involvement in the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NATO,&lt;/strong&gt; by virtue of its mission to defend the Euro-Atlantic area, is the designated venue to coordinate allied navies through its Maritime Command (MARCOM) headquartered in Northwood in the United Kingdom. NATO ensures a permanent presence at sea through its two multinational Standing Naval Maritime Groups (SNMG) and their two mine countermeasures equivalents (SNMCMG); it also plans major military exercises, such as Dynamic Manta, Dynamic Guard, and Dynamic Mongoose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, however, since the end of the Cold War NATO has followed the general European movement toward low-end missions, launching its own counter-piracy effort in the Indian Ocean (Ocean Shield, 2009–2016) and maritime security operations in the Mediterranean (Operation Sea Guardian, launched in 2016 to take over from Operation Active Endeavour, which had been set up in the wake of the 9/11 attacks and is now largely moribund).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alliance is now trying to adapt to ongoing trends toward naval warfare, especially following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. NATO has thus launched initiatives that focus on applying disruptive technologies in the maritime domain, such as the Maritime Unmanned Systems Initiative to enhance the alliance’s capabilities, particularly in the areas of anti-submarine warfare and mine countermeasures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union has accrued experience in deploying naval operations (EUNAVFOR) along non-European shores, such as Atalanta in the Indian Ocean or Sophia (and then Irini) along the Libyan coastline. These have primarily been performing maritime security tasks, countering piracy, and conducting maritime surveillance assignments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union adopted its first EU Maritime Security Strategy and its Action Plan in 2014. The 2022 Strategic Compass puts EU maritime security, joint capability development, and interoperability high on the agenda. The development of an EU Rapid Deployment Capacity reaction force of up to 5,000 troops should include maritime components. The Strategic Compass also commits EU countries to expanding the European Union’s Coordinated Maritime Presence concept, designed to enhance maritime security in fragile areas that are key to European interests. A pilot project has been tested in the Gulf of Guinea and is now fully operational. Consistent with the European Union’s Indo-Pacific strategy, which commits to “a meaningful European naval presence” in the region, member states have agreed to implement a second Coordinated Maritime Presence in the northern Indian Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Strategic Compass also commissioned an update of the 2014 EU Maritime Security Strategy, complemented by an Action Plan, published in March 2023. It commits the European Union to stepping up its action under six strategic objectives: activities at sea, including through naval exercises; partnerships, including deepening EU-NATO cooperation; a leading role on maritime domain awareness; managing risks and threats; boosting capabilities; and education and training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to support joint capability development, the European Union (through its member states) has sought to foster naval cooperation by means of PESCO and the Coordinated Annual Review on Defence. Initial financing is coming from the European Defence Fund as a means to lower development, construction, and maintenance costs while helping the development of harmonized standards. It is in this framework that the project to develop a European Patrol Corvette by 2030 has been agreed upon. Led by Italy, with the participation of France, Greece, and Spain, the project is set to deliver the first “EU-developed” vessel of its kind. Other PESCO projects also aim at developing technologies for the maritime domain. These include the Maritime Unmanned Anti-Submarine System, coordinated by Portugal, along with the project led by Belgium in cooperation with several other smaller navies for delivering semi-autonomous and autonomous underwater, surface, and aerial technologies for mine countermeasures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OBSTACLE: SCARCE INDUSTRIAL AND OPERATIONAL INTEGRATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The naval shipbuilding industry, with more than a dozen shipyards, is still one of the few defense sectors in Europe that has not undergone any major consolidation in recent decades. Industrial cooperation has proven challenging for Europeans eager to defend and promote their national defense industrial base. Each of the large shipbuilding countries has its own industrial champion, often partly owned by the state. Shipyards are usually large employers that generate a high return for the local economies. Disputes over the lead shipyard or difficulties in reconciling national requirements have therefore hampered several projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from PESCO, joint investments, procurement, and projects remain scarce. Europeans operate 29 different types of frigates and destroyers (compared to four in the United States) and 45 different offshore patrol vessels. There are only a few examples of successful integration, mostly between neighboring countries:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;France and Italy:&lt;/strong&gt; In 1992, the two countries launched the Horizon program, which led to the development and construction of nearly identical advanced destroyers for the French and Italian navies, allowing for a high degree of interoperability. They further agreed in 2002 to jointly develop the FREMM, which has become a competitive ship for exports. They also cooperated in the design of the Vulcano and Jacques Chevallier classes of fleet-replenishment oilers. In late 2019, the two national champions, Italy’s Fincantieri and France’s Naval Group, created their joint venture Naviris, which leads the European Patrol Corvette consortium.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Belgium and the Netherlands:&lt;/strong&gt; The countries established a joint naval staff, based on the BeNeSam agreements, signed as early as 1948 and strengthened in 1995. They both operate the same Karel Doorman–type frigates and decided in 2018 to jointly build 24 vessels (including two frigates), worth €4 billion. They also agreed with Denmark to establish a joint command for their special forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The United Kingdom and France:&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to the ongoing FC/ASW project, the two countries have jointly developed the anti-ship missile Sea Venom through European missile manufacturer MBDA.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other significant bilateral projects include the construction by German TKMS of six Type-212CD submarines, of which four will be delivered to Norway before 2030, integrating missiles from the joint venture between TKMS and Norwegian Kongsberg. The Volcano long-range ammunition developed by Italian Leonardo and German Diehl can also be mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The few multilateral examples include the Tripartite or Eridan mine countermeasure vessels developed by Belgium, France, and the Netherlands in the 1970s. Additionally, the small navies of the three Baltic states — Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania — have established a joint naval unit, BALTRON, with small bases in each country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the operational level, the European Union and NATO favor interoperability through their standing groups, operations, exercises, and joint drills. Beyond the European Union and NATO, however, some naval coalitions have been formed on an ad hoc basis. This is the case of the Joint Expeditionary Force ( JEF) assembled by the United Kingdom and based on an agreement with nine other European nations. Another example is the French-initiated European Maritime Awareness in the Strait of Hormuz project. Aimed at ensuring the freedom of navigation in the Gulf, it brings together seven other EU countries and is headquartered in Abu Dhabi, UAE. France also launched the European Intervention Initiative in 2018 in order to foster common strategic culture and develop the ability to jointly deploy quickly in case of crises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, some navies sponsor exercises that usefully put increasing emphasis on high-end and naval warfare, such as the French-led Polaris or Italian-led Mare Aperto. It is worth noting that even though this level of integration between various national navies remains unparalleled when compared to other continents, it is yet insufficient to present a united and fully interoperable European force in case of high intensity conflict at sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;critical-capability-gaps&quot;&gt;Critical Capability Gaps&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many Western European nations are investing in “high-end,” technologically advanced maritime equipment. While these capabilities are important, emerging adversarial cyber and space tactics make European states vulnerable. Traditional maritime assets and “low-end” proven capabilities will be critical in the event of conflict. Additionally, these assets will be able to conduct routine law enforcement at sea — operations such as anti-piracy, anti-trafficking, search and rescue, and sea lane and EEZ patrols — while also providing warnings and indicators to counter malign actions such as tampering with seabed infrastructure or potential gray zone operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe has a broad technological competence and high capability in the integration of complex technological knowledge areas such as sensors, propulsion, electronics, weapons systems, protection technology, and lightweight construction. But due to their tardy awakening to the risk of renewed naval warfare, European navies are lagging in a certain number of critical capabilities and systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anti-submarine Warfare:&lt;/strong&gt; NATO and the European Union need to ensure their anti-submarine warfare capabilities are ready to deter and deny any threat from a peer competitor. Investment in submarines is essential to control the undersea domain, to stand up to the acute Russian threat, and to have the ability to deploy to the Indo-Pacific theater to address the China pacing threat. The United Kingdom is making that investment with the Astute-class submarine, but others need to follow suit to have a critical mass at the European level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The industrial potential to increase undersea capabilities exists, as seven nations have historical roots in submarine production: France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Norway, Sweden, and Spain. France is the only European country to master the technology to build nuclear submarines but refuses to export such submarines for non-proliferation reasons. Industrial support and additional port facilities capable of offering maintenance can provide a much-needed strategic edge and control of the maritime environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In parallel, investments need to be made in undersea monitoring capabilities, following the model of the U.S. Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS) network by placing hydrophone nets near critical infrastructure on the seabed. These networks, coupled with coordinated submarine, surface, and aircraft capable of combined ASW, can be instrumental. The United States will also need to share these warnings and indicators through intelligence centers that contribute to NATO and EU maritime domain awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uninhabited Vehicles:&lt;/strong&gt; In the war in Ukraine, uninhabited aircraft have proven effective on both sides of the battlefield. Expanding this capability in the maritime environment will bridge the gap between the high-end and low-end equipment. Air, surface, and undersea vehicles not only can bring kinetic effects but more importantly provide essential targeting and intelligence. As naval combat maneuvers will be increasingly “uncrewed,” uninhabited vehicles are likely to serve as linchpins for systems integration, including in terms of artificial intelligence, quantum technologies, or directed energy weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With few exceptions (the United Kingdom, France), national investments and PESCO projects are not enough to sustain competition with Europe’s main rivals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Missiles:&lt;/strong&gt; The Ukraine war has revealed the critical importance of munitions stockpiles. According to Jeremy Stöhs, after years of downscaling, navies retain only a limited number of frigates and destroyers designed for air-defense tasks. These warships are comparatively lightly armed and lack the necessary number of battle force missiles and corresponding vertical launch systems (VLS) cells to conduct and sustain high-end naval operations effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seabed Warfare:&lt;/strong&gt; The seabed is critical to the European economy and way of life. NATO and the European Union therefore need to ensure that adversaries do not disrupt the free flow of commerce, energy, and data. Pipelines have already proven a target, but information-sharing networks or communications cables could be next. Admiral James Stavridis, former supreme allied commander of NATO, succinctly captured this resource war at sea: “There is now a vast critical infrastructure at sea, yet the United States and its allies have done precious little to prepare to defend it, including honing offensive skills to create real deterrence in the mind of any potential attacker.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The infrastructure, training, and equipment required to adequately defend this vital network will take years to develop. While Russia has the same problems, it has already started to fortify its energy assets in the Baltic Sea and High North. NATO and the European Union do not carry the same threat to Russian undersea assets that Russia poses to NATO due to the alliance’s respect for the international rules-based order. Russia has been suspected of tampering with seabed lines of communication for years, especially at the transatlantic node that leads into France’s naval base in Brest. Creating redundancy in these vital lines of communication is one investment that could prove effective, especially with the increased accessibility of the Artic. For NATO, investment needs to happen immediately, with clearly defined tripwires across alliances and partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technological Innovation:&lt;/strong&gt; Emerging and disruptive technologies have received considerable attention in the military planning of revisionist powers such as Russia and China, including quantum technology, hypersonic and conventional missiles, and directed energy weapons. The ideal modern warship should be equipped with a great number of cutting-edge sensors, countermeasures, and weapons that increase both its offensive and defensive capabilities, while relying on an advanced combat management system able to manage all systems and the incoming data — and to be connected to an integrated network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mine Countermeasures:&lt;/strong&gt; The use of mines is a tool that leverages uncertainty to deter an adversary with minimal assets. Russia has the largest quantity of mines of any nation — approximately 250,000 munitions — and knows that its Western competitors are bound by a prohibition against the use of mines. Russia would likely attempt to mine the shores of NATO allies in advance of an offensive operation. The alliance must be ready to immediately clear those waters and needs to invest in demining capability to ensure that freedom of navigation is maintained throughout the Euro-Atlantic area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The accession of Finland and Sweden into the alliance will bring two highly capable military forces into NATO, whose strengths include mining and demining capabilities. The Gulf of Finland is a strategic sea lane for Russia into St. Petersburg and a strategic area for contested EEZ operations. Finland, alongside the alliance, will defend those waters and can contain the Russian naval and civilian vessels in port through offensive mining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amphibious Readiness:&lt;/strong&gt; There is little recent familiarity of amphibious deployments among European navies. However, approximately 40 percent of the world’s population, or nearly 2.4 billion people, reside within 100 km of coasts, which will likely increase the needs for deployments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human Resources:&lt;/strong&gt; A widespread issue among European navies is the lack of manpower needed to adequately operate and crew some of their current capabilities, or the ones they are investing in. This can have severe operational impacts as it can constitute an important hurdle to deployment. There is an acute need to plug gaps in terms of numbers and skills, through both recruitment campaigns and training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above elements show that the European navies need to accelerate and expand their efforts, adapt to a rapidly changing environment, and be further rationalized and integrated. This last section lays out recommendations related to capabilities, tools, and governance, and it concludes by looking at what the United States could do to support these needed evolutions. This section purposely does not tackle geographical priorities, since the authors assume that European navies should in any event aim to have a global reach due to the rapidly changing security environment and the interconnectedness of challenges and threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;capacities-robustness-and-flexibility&quot;&gt;Capacities: Robustness and Flexibility&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aim for the higher end:&lt;/strong&gt; The diversification and intensification of challenges at sea call for increased investment in capabilities that will help Europeans cope with the whole spectrum of warfare. When pondering prioritization, this report suggests giving the priority to the higher end, for the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of all the threats identified, “strategic competition” and the ensuing risk of modern naval warfare is the most “capacity intensive” and the one that can have the biggest impact on European navies. To sustain competition, European countries need to be able to have a deterrent presence at sea, and — if needed — to combat and ultimately prevail. High-end capabilities are what strategic competitors will look at when strategizing their approach to Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;High-end equipped vessels are inherently multipurpose and can carry out several tasks. They are therefore fit for various kinds of security environments. In peacetime, they can serve as deterrent; be used for training, exercises, or routine maritime security operations; and easily switch to combat mode if required. Vessels dedicated to lower-end missions do not have this reversibility.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Higher intensity does not necessarily mean higher concentration. There is indeed a risk in concentrating budgets into high-end combat forces: that European navies become even smaller in numbers than they already are. To conjugate robustness and flexibility, modern European capabilities should be easily dispersible, stealthy, and agile.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not underestimate mass:&lt;/strong&gt; Facing the proliferation of combat capabilities coming from competitors and rivals, it is essential that Europeans be able to assemble a robust and deterrent presence in different geopolitical hotspots simultaneously if needed. To concomitantly deploy sufficiently robust groupings in order to efficiently defend their interests in a multi-theater conflict, Europeans need to have a critical mass of available assets — with their partners when possible, but also on their own when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foster multi-domain approach and modularity:&lt;/strong&gt; Naval warfare touches perhaps more physical domains than any other kind of warfare, as it extends from space, through the air, onto the sea surface, underwater, and down to the seabed, not to mention the coastal areas that are stage to amphibious operations. As suggested by Jeremy Stöhs: “Defense planners should consider fusing together sea-, air-, land- and space-based sensors (including unmanned platforms) to establish more comprehensive C2 and Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition, and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) arrangements that allow joint, multinational forces to perform the full array of naval missions.” This multi-domain approach should be tested through training and exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modularity should continue to grow to easily switch between mission sets by bringing on or off compartmentalized capability, such as mission payload kits for specific threats (anti-submarine warfare, surface warfare, electronic warfare/intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance [ISR], air defense, and mine warfare, to name a few). “Bolt on, bolt off” capabilities could be created. For instance, with the changing ISR landscape, different nations can work at the speed of technology to field cutting-edge signals and intelligence-gathering mission systems. Interoperable systems that link into a variety of vessels can increase domain awareness — future capabilities could even see advanced weapons systems with the bolt on, bolt off design — advancing the concepts of containerized vertical launch capabilities but avoiding the legal minefield of making maritime vessels combatants. Modularity and the bolt on, bolt off concept come with their own risks. Primarily, in a contested environment, vessels may lack the ability to utilize facilities capable of changing payload kits. The second risk is that these concepts may not work for legacy platforms, likely requiring time and investment to field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beef up shore-based defense:&lt;/strong&gt; Russian and Chinese examples show an emphasis on land-based A2/AD to advance and secure interests in the maritime domain. As some Black Sea and Scandinavian states are already demonstrating, defense planners should enhance land-based aviation, anti-ship missiles, and coastal-defense missile systems (similar to those responsible for the sinking of the Moskva); sensors (including space-based assets); and cyber capabilities to secure European shores. This particularly applies to smaller states (the Western Balkans or the Baltic states, for instance), which should leverage the potential of AI, semi-autonomous and fully autonomous systems, and other disruptive technologies to deny adversaries sea control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get serious about industrial consolidation:&lt;/strong&gt; Europeans remain highly dependent on the United States for high-end capabilities, sensors, and logistical support. Although it is less a problem to be dependent on an ally than on potential rivals, Europeans first need to take their share of NATO’s combined effort to maintain a competitive edge. Additionally, in case of changes in trade and industry strategies from the United States, they need to be able to produce and procure their own equipment. This requires multiplying bilateral and multilateral cooperation. One key line of effort should be the integration and interoperability of unmanned assets through a “systems of systems,” which will be crucial in future operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make full use of EU instruments:&lt;/strong&gt; The PESCO framework, although still a fledgling project, has already shown its added value — such as with the European Patrol Corvette. This potential should be fully harnessed, especially when EU funds allocated to defense projects such as the recent European Defence Fund and the upcoming European Defence Investment Program are fully available, and hopefully significant enough to drive technological progress forward. New projects in the aforementioned “critical capability gaps” could be prioritized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also applies to projects aimed at enhancing European readiness. As suggested by Daniel Fiott, a specific project could be dedicated to amphibious forces, “linking to existing and future [PESCO] projects such as ‘co-basing,’ amphibious assault ships, precision-guided munitions, high-speed craft, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) and air power capacities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build a European submarine:&lt;/strong&gt; Building on the experience of the European Patrol Corvette, Europeans should step up their ambition and consider the joint development of new critical capabilities, such as submarines. The following options could be envisioned:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A high-end, European-made and EU-funded, new class of submarines.&lt;/em&gt; Industrial powers with a history of cooperation and national know-how on submarines could apply to existing (European Defence Fund) and upcoming (European Defence Investment Program) EU funds and think about the development of new capacities that could become flagships for European defense.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An “AUKUS-like” partnership with a key Indo-Pacific partner.&lt;/em&gt; France and Italy could perhaps harness the close ties they developed respectively with India, including in the provision or development of critical capabilities (e.g., Rafale jet fighters, existing cooperation on submarines between Paris and New Delhi) to develop trilateral security partnerships comprising of an ambitious and meaningful industrial project.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An effort to fill intra-European gaps.&lt;/em&gt; Countries with industrial capacities (Germany, for instance, with the Netherlands or Norway) could build coastal submarines fitted for the member states deprived of such capacities, such as the Baltic states.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;governance-and-institutional-support&quot;&gt;Governance and Institutional Support&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think of an overarching coordinating structure:&lt;/strong&gt; Inspired by the Maritime Areas of Interest Coordination Cell of the EU Coordinated Maritime Presences, a light structure could be established to bring together European countries’ naval staff, along with representatives of NATO and the European Union, in order to coordinate deployments, engage in operational planning, or conduct exercises. It would allow the UK navy to participate in a European organization, and it would also be open for Cyprus and Turkey to join as long as they do not impose restrictions on other members. This body’s main aim would be to synchronize and deconflict respective efforts, with a view to ensuring a consistent and coordinated European presence at sea. Down the road, such a structure could evolve to bring closer doctrines, tactics, and strategic thinking more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expand information fusion:&lt;/strong&gt; Maritime situational awareness is a key enabler for European navies. Integration is underway through the Maritime Surveillance (MARSUR) project, which is a technical solution that allows dialogue between maritime information systems and is provided to 18 member states plus Norway and the United Kingdom. Building on this effort, Europeans should aim at a comprehensive and performative shared platform able to integrate upcoming technological innovations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhance political-military approach:&lt;/strong&gt; Deployment strategies should be more concerted between defense and foreign affairs ministries to maximize their strategic effect. This applies at the national level, as well as for bilateral or multilateral efforts, such as the commitment by France and the United Kingdom during the March 2023 bilateral summit to coordinate their carriers’ deployments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maximize effects through partnerships:&lt;/strong&gt; Investing in navy-to-navy partnerships can prove highly beneficial to Europeans for several reasons. As European nations will struggle to significantly expand their global presence at sea in the short to medium term, engaging in operational cooperation is paramount to develop interoperability, to offset the European absence in certain regions, and ultimately to build new coalitions to tackle shared challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In parallel, European navies still have a lot of expertise to share and should emerge as the key partners of major regional powers, especially those who are wary of too close cooperation with the United States and are being courted by China and Russia — such as Brazil, Mexico, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Indonesia, or Malaysia. Finally, building sound and confident relationships with countries along key sea lines of communication, such as Egypt, the UAE, India, and Singapore, can prove instrumental to providing against potential disruption attempts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-the-united-states-can-and-should-do-to-help&quot;&gt;What the United States Can and Should Do to Help&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States remains the centerpiece of NATO’s maritime forces. It therefore has a pivotal role to play in leading by example and increasing European navies’ joint warfighting readiness. It should at the same time encourage European navies to be more responsible and more credible on their own, to make sure that they are able to do their share in defending the international rules-based order everywhere on the planet. Recently, the U.S. Navy used the Italian FREMM design to invest in the new Constellation-class guided-missile frigate (FFG 62), modifying it to meet U.S. standards and navigating congressional restrictions on utilizing U.S. manufactured frigates. Despite the balance struck, this $5.5 billion contract in collaboration with a foreign ally strengthens the bond between countries, may increase interoperability, and shows other nations that filling critical capability gaps in a timely, cost effective way can outweigh national interests. In the future, that message and encouragement across NATO and the European Union will be critical to ensure that defense spending in European nations remains at a level that can support broader objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（15日）踏入審訊第57天。認罪被告林景楠今接受代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 盤問，同意2020年3月曾獲沈旭暉聯絡邀請參選立法會功能組別，林並曾提名何桂藍參加初選。惟林於6月發文稱「面對制度敗壞」決定不參選進出口界，改為參選新界東，他盤問下指會定義自己為「非建制」，並解釋進出口界選民多為建制派、他勝算不大，支持他的市民亦無法在該界別投票。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方應辯方要求傳召認罪被告林景楠&quot;&gt;控方應辯方要求傳召認罪被告林景楠&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;上周相繼確診的施德來和彭卓棋，今早仍快測陽性，獲安排於延伸庭就坐，3名法官均配戴口罩。主控羅天瑋表示，將應辯方要求傳召林景楠接受盤問。獲准保釋的林景楠戴深藍色口罩、身穿白色襯衫和黑色西裝從正庭門口入庭，延伸庭的黃之鋒、馮達浚均發笑，馮其後不停與袁嘉蔚討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;林在主問下確認他是於香港出生的商人，並已就本案認罪。法官陳慶偉續問誰希望發問，過了數秒後代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 站起身，指正等待看有沒有人會問，但似乎只有他有問題要問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;林同意沈旭暉3月聯絡參選功能組別惟無提初選-後宣布參選進出口界&quot;&gt;林同意沈旭暉3月聯絡參選功能組別惟無提初選 後宣布參選進出口界&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在 Beel 盤問下，林景楠同意於今年1月19日及26日錄取兩份證人供詞。辯方問，他是否於2020年3月獲沈旭暉聯絡參與功能組別初選，他同意，惟在辯方追問下指「我當時嘅認知其實就有關於功能組別，就冇關於初選嘅」，指沈並無提過初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續展示林1月26日供詞，提及「大約在2020年3月，沈旭暉透過 WhatsApp 聯絡我，希望我可以參加初選功能組別」，林主動指供詞亦提到3月28日沈主持的協調會議「主要係傾有咩人出嚟參與初選嘅功能組別」，指此兩處均出現「初選」，解釋相信「當時嘅警員輸入錯咗，而我冇即時提醒返佢」，重申與沈的溝通「冇提過任何初選嘅嘢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;林同意，與沈旭暉接觸後，於2020年3月4日宣布參選功能組別，並於3月28日於新蒲崗出席由沈主持的功能組別協調會議，但除沈外不記得其他與會者。他同意會上討論誰參加功能組別，但無關初選，印象中也沒討論民主派當選後會做什麼；會上也清楚是由他參選進出口界別。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;林同意曾支持何桂藍參選-惟翌日問區諾軒可否轉為選新東&quot;&gt;林同意曾支持何桂藍參選 惟翌日問區諾軒可否轉為選新東&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;林景楠在盤問下同意，於6月18日曾於 Facebook 發文支持提名何桂藍參加初選，他亦有提名何桂藍，而當時他仍有意參選功能組別。不過到了6月19日，林聯絡區諾軒問可否轉為參選新界東。林確認此前與區有聯絡、區知道他有意選進出口界，而林亦知道要有盡量多民主派在功能組別勝出，才能達致立會過半。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問區沒有嘗試游說他繼續參選功能助別？林指「佢有希望我留低，但冇好積極游說」，並同意他其後與戴耀廷就此事討論，區並告訴他可參與新界東初選，着他聯絡趙家賢準備提名，林並於6月20日宣布不會參選功能組別。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;曾指進出口界制度敗壞故不參選-解釋屬小眾選民屬建制派&quot;&gt;曾指進出口界「制度敗壞」故不參選 解釋屬「小眾」、選民屬建制派&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續展示林景楠當日帖文，提及「面對制度敗壞，我決定“不會”參選2020年立法會功能組別的進出口界選舉」，問「制度敗壞」是什麼意思。林解釋，當時接觸到很多地區選民，他們不能在功能組別投票給他，故認為是「制度問題」。法官李運騰問即他在地區直選的勝算比功能組別大？林指「法官大人，係有一定咁嘅諗法嘅」，但重申最主要是支持他的市民不能在功能組別投票，故他選擇參與地區直選，同意他在進出口界沒機會勝出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 追問「敗壞」的意思，是否指制度本質上不公。林指字面上的演繹，就是功能組別「一直以來都係一啲指定嘅、或者合資格嘅選民先可以投票，但只屬於小眾嘅」。Beel 問他當時會否形容自己為民主派，林答「如果要我去定義自己呢，我會定義自己係非建制」。Beel 再問進出口界是否建制派才可勝出？林指據他當時所知，該界別選民基本上都是一些商會的成員，他們都是建制派人士。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;法官質疑敗壞建基政治立場-林指進出口界無競爭下當選因社會氣氛用強硬字眼&quot;&gt;法官質疑「敗壞」建基政治立場 林指進出口界無競爭下當選、因社會氣氛用強硬字眼&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，所以林指功能組別制度敗壞，只是因為選民大部分為建制派，若以同一邏輯，地區直選傾向支持民主派，那也是敗壞了？此時何桂藍微笑。林解釋是考慮到選民的數字。法官陳慶偉續指，林提到制度敗壞，是認為制度不公，因選民大部分來自建制派，林答「係嘅法官大人」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟陳續笑着以法律界為例，指大部分選民來自民主派，多年來亦由民主派當選，他又會否形容該組別為敗壞？林指「我聽到你嘅諗法嘅法官大人，或者我加多少少自己嘅諗法」，解釋當時看到進出口界過去四屆立法會選舉均在無競爭情況下由建制派當選，加上要成為該界別選民並不容易，「唔係自己本身有做相關業務就可以成為選民」，故形容為制度問題。而他當時使用「敗壞」兩字，「我相信都係嗰陣時嘅社會氣氛，所以我用咗一個咁強硬嘅字眼。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;林解釋參選新東因在該區長大與何桂藍同區承認政治觸覺都幾差&quot;&gt;林解釋參選新東因在該區長大、與何桂藍同區承認「政治觸覺都幾差」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;林景楠續同意，於6月20日宣布參選新界東初選。李運騰問這區有他支持的何桂藍參選，他為何選擇參選新界東？林指「首先我想承認自己啲政治觸覺其實都幾差嘅」，並指他參選新界東，是因他自小在該區長大、是該區選民，而他作為商人當時在新界東有約7間分店，故經常會在該區與市民和顧客溝通。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 並指，帖文亦提及「功能組別、議會制度上的不堪」，問是什麼意思。惟陳慶偉打斷指已問過相關問題，不認為需重複，又指知道這基本上是小圈子選舉，而且合資格選民有限，因而有不公的情況，「我想我們全都明白。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續指，林在帖文亦提到「議會上議員放棄投票」是他轉為選地區直選的主因，林解釋是指非建制派議員。他不太記得當時他們就什麼議案棄權，但「我自己覺得議員係應該有佢哋嘅取態，而唔係投棄權票」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;林稱朋友游說下重返進出口界參選-但截止日才獲足夠提名&quot;&gt;林稱朋友游說下重返進出口界參選 但截止日才獲足夠提名&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在 Beel 盤問下，林承認自己在7月初選的成績不佳，得票排名無法進入頭7位，其後他在7月27日於 Facebook 再宣布參選進出口界。李運騰問到，為何選擇重返他早前形容為「敗壞」的進出口界？林解釋，因獲身邊其他朋友游說，「既然都無人參加，而我有資格參加，咁不如試一試啦。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李再追問，林認為最重要的是否勝出，而非制度是否「敗壞」，林表示重返進出口界參選「係唔容易嘅」，因「我印象中到（發文）嗰一日，其實我都未有足夠提名票」，並在截止報名日期前才剛好獲得足夠的10票，即10個提名人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;林認自己無機會於進出口界勝出不曾出席地區協調會&quot;&gt;林認自己無機會於進出口界勝出、不曾出席地區協調會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到進出口界約有多少個選民，林表示應該有數千個選民或團體合資格投票。Beel 問到林參選時，是否現實地（realistically）認為自己不會勝出，林回答：「我認為自己係冇乜機會勝出嘅」，Beel 表示已完成盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，在李運騰提問下，林確認於6月20日才決定由功能組別轉為於地區直選參選，而在這天之前他並無出席任何地方選區的協調會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;林作供約50分鐘便由警員護送離開法庭，並乘車離開，他在不足一小時內曾9度稱「法官大人」。控方其後傳召證物鏈相關警員作供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/buMBb1S.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（15日）踏入審訊第57天。控方傳召負責網上蒐證的國安處警員馮小敏作供，她供稱2020年7月初選舉行前獲指示調查網上有關35+初選的資料，並因過程中知道戴是初選的「主要人物」而着重調查他。馮同意，其隊伍共用一個名為「鄧奇」的 Facebook 帳戶，「鄧奇」是假名，她並以此帳戶進行截圖。辯方展示警方截圖，顯示戴耀廷7月回應中聯辦譴責初選違法的帖文下，「鄧奇」曾留言「唔犯法都等天收啦你!!!!!」，馮指沒印象發出此留言，但承認該帳戶只是由警員使用。法官問，該留言是否可引致和激起（provoke）其他人的留言，馮答「冇錯」。不過據記者觀察，相關帳戶在馮作供後數小時已變為無法查看。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;女警指初選前獲訓示調查網上資料-但無提及特定人物&quot;&gt;女警指初選前獲訓示調查網上資料 但無提及特定人物&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;林景楠今早接受辯方盤問後，控方傳召負責網上蒐證的國安處偵緝女警員16117馮小敏作供。馮供稱，她於2013年加入警隊，自2020年7月駐守國安處至今，就本案她獲指示到網上搜集有關社交媒體及影片的證據。她確認自己負責下載及保存相關記錄，當中包括媒體報道和戴耀廷的文章，如戴在《蘋果日報》撰寫的「立會奪半」文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馮稱，於2020年7月頭收到女督察訓示，需在網上調查有關35+初選的資料。代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 問到，她接獲訓示時初選已舉行還是正準備舉行，馮回應：「我嘅印象係進行式，即係35+選舉同時間進行緊。」李運騰問到是於7月11至12日的初選之前或之後，馮表示是之前。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 追問督察的訓示內容是否予她印象有罪案發生（a crime has taken place），馮表示督察只是叫他們「多加留意」35+初選，並需要他們在網上各方面的媒體調查，以看看有否違反《國安法》。被問有否指定看《國安法》前或後的內容，馮指有關初選的資料都要搜查；亦無獲指示調查特定的人物名字，只要是與初選相關的任何人物都會調查。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;女警指得知戴耀廷為初選主要人物故着重調查&quot;&gt;女警指得知戴耀廷為初選「主要人物」故着重調查&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 其後問，馮有沒有獲指示調查與戴耀廷相關的資料，馮表示起初只是調查35+初選的相關人物，而在調查期間知道戴是初選中的「主要人物」，因此就着重調查有關資料，但她並無檢視屬於戴的電子器材。馮曾檢視戴的 Facebook 帖文，但無聯絡 Facebook 服務商以調查帖文。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到有否搜集證據顯示戴是帖文的作者，馮表示因見到戴耀廷的帳戶名後面有藍剔，以其理解是代表官方身份認證，但同意若任何人有戴的帳戶資料，該人可以登入其帳戶。馮亦負責搜集《蘋果日報》電子版中戴所撰寫的文章，但她沒有聯絡《蘋果》以確認文章作者是否戴。馮另確認不知道 YouTube 等網上影片是如何出現，以及內容有否經過編輯或改動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;女警確認隊伍共用fb帳戶鄧奇-截圖顯示曾於戴耀廷帖文留言唔犯法都等天收啦你&quot;&gt;女警確認隊伍共用FB帳戶「鄧奇」 截圖顯示曾於戴耀廷帖文留言「唔犯法都等天收啦你」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在代表陳志全的大律師馬維騉盤問下，馮確認她並非調查網上資料的唯一警員。馬問到「鄧奇」這個名字會否喚起她的記憶，馮表示記得這是她用作截圖時的 Facebook 帳戶，只是「暱稱、假名」，這時延伸庭的被告起哄並互相討論。馬問其同事會否使用「鄧奇」的帳戶截圖，馮表示有機會出現這個情況，「因為呢一個係我哋隊共用嘅一個 Facebook 帳戶嚟。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬其後展示警方於2020年7月31日對戴耀廷 Facebook 帖文的截圖，截圖右上方顯示帳戶為「鄧奇」，馮承認自己會登入帳戶截圖。截圖顯示戴於7月14日發帖文，內容為：「中聯辦的聲明指我協調此次民主派初選是『典型的涉嫌犯法』，我必須嚴正地指出這指控是完全不合常理的。」馮確認是由她截取。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬其後展示該帖文留言一欄，顯示「鄧奇」於截圖的「一週前」發出留言：「唔犯法都等天收啦你!!!!!」，並置於留言欄的最頂。延伸庭的被告看到後驚訝高呼：「嘩！」，譚凱邦「哈哈」地大笑出聲，並一直瞪大雙眼，至於黃之鋒則震驚「O嘴」，袁嘉蔚及吳敏兒亦有大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問留言是否可激起他人留言-警冇錯&quot;&gt;官問留言是否可激起他人留言 警：冇錯&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬問到這句留言是否由馮發出，馮立即回應：「我無印象」，但她承認只有警員而非其他人會使用這個帳戶。法官陳仲衡續問，該留言是否可激起（provoke）其他人進一步留言，馮答「冇錯」。馮作供完畢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;翻查戴耀廷相關帖文，顯示相同字眼的留言於2020年7月17日下午11時32分，由帳戶「鄧漢其」發出，該帳戶有5名朋友，報稱於2014年9月開始在理工大學「建築科技及管理學（BTM）」就讀。不過據記者觀察，相關帳戶在馮作供後數小時已顯示為「目前無法查看此內容」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（15日）踏入審訊第57天。時任新界東選舉主任楊蕙心接受盤問，指2020年立會選舉提名期前，曾獲官員「特別提點」要考慮參選人言行會否令人懷疑不會真誠擁護《基本法》及效忠香港特區；而她在何桂藍報名後，獲政制及內地事務局提供其FB帖文，提及「義無反顧」反對《國安法》等，楊發信要求何解釋，何回應《國安法》多處牴觸《基本法》、衝擊司法制度和侵犯港人自由。楊指何的答覆「冇所謂啱定錯」，她亦沒有考慮參選人政治背景，但認為《國安法》已加入保障權利自由的條文，何桂藍的解釋不成立，亦清晰顯示她並非真誠支持特區維護國安，故決定DQ她。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方一度提出，政府有意DQ所有民主派，惟法官質疑問題誤導，因並非所有參選被告均被DQ。楊其後同意，就新東8名參選被告，她裁定楊岳橋等3人提名無效，其他人則因選舉延後而未作出決定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;選舉主任楊蕙心稱獲提點-留意參選人言行會否令人懷疑擁護基本法的真實性&quot;&gt;選舉主任楊蕙心稱獲提點 留意參選人言行會否令人懷疑擁護《基本法》的真實性&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今早傳召認罪被告林景楠及負責網上蒐證的國安警馮小敏後，下午應辯方要求傳召時任新界東選舉主任楊蕙心接受盤問。楊於1998年加入政府，2020年7月任離島區民政事務專員，並於6月19日獲時任選委會主席馮驊委任為2020年立會選舉新界東的選舉主任，於7月接任。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 盤問下，楊確認此前沒做過選舉主任，只在立會功能組別選舉及區議會選舉擔任過助理選舉主任；並指2020年立會選舉提名期開始前，選舉事務處曾向所有參與的工作人員發出手冊，清楚解釋根據相關法例他們在選舉中需擔任的工作，事前亦舉行解說會解釋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問楊就參選人根據《立法會條例》第40(1)(b)(i)條，作出擁護《基本法》及保證效忠香港特區的聲明，有否接獲特定指示。楊表示「記憶唔係真係好清晰或好仔細，唔係完全記得好清楚」，只記得手冊有提醒他們依照法例要求工作。法官李運騰追問，就何謂擁護《基本法》及效忠香港特區，當局有沒有提供具體例子？楊表示以其記憶所及，沒有特別精確地提及如何處理該要求，但相關官員曾於簡介會「特別提點」他們，要考慮參選人言行有否令人懷疑其聲明的真確性。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊收何桂藍提名表3日後發信要求翌日回覆-不覺時間不合理因要徵詢法律意見&quot;&gt;楊收何桂藍提名表3日後發信要求翌日回覆 不覺時間不合理因要徵詢法律意見&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在 Beel 盤問下，楊蕙心確認於7月22日收到何桂藍的提名表格，她3日後發信要求何就兩條問題作回應，涉兩則 Facebook 帖文，並要求她翌日下午兩時前回覆，否則會據相關資料決定提名是否有效。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問給予這麼短的時間參選人回覆是否正常，楊指「呢個時間其實都唔係一個唔合理嘅時間」，因提名期於31日截止，「我哋剩低嘅時間都唔係太多啦」，而提問的內容也「頗為清晰」。楊又指，參選人回覆後也只剩數天時間，她除了自己考慮，亦要視乎情況徵詢法律意見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊稱從政制局獲何桂藍fb帖文強調無考慮參選人背景只考慮言行&quot;&gt;楊稱從政制局獲何桂藍FB帖文、強調無考慮參選人背景只考慮言行&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問如何獲得何桂藍的 Facebook 帖文，楊表示收到其提名表格後就徵詢同事，包括選舉主任辦事處、政制及內地事務局等；而何的帖文應是從政制及內地事務局所得。楊表示不記得政制及內地事務局提供文件的數量，但肯定全部都是可從公眾平台獲得的公開文件，並同意在她審視的材料中，只找到兩則是「有問題（problematic）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊供稱，在新界東的28份提名表格中，曾向4名民主派參選人發信查詢。Beel 問有否發信給建制派，楊強調「我冇考慮過個候選人背景是否民主派或者建制派」，只會考慮其公開言行會否令她認為沒有客觀意圖符合聲明的規定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊多番追問下同意裁何桂藍提名無效文件由他人草擬-自己同意並簽署&quot;&gt;楊多番追問下同意裁何桂藍提名無效文件由他人草擬 自己同意並簽署&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，楊蕙心就取消何桂藍資格的決定有否索取法律意見，惟陳慶偉指不認為與案件相關，指現在並非對選舉主任決定進行司法覆核。Beel 其後展示由楊簽署、裁定何桂藍提名無效的信件，問是由她抑或他人所撰，楊指「文件係我參考咗法律意見之後，由我發出」。Beel 追問是由她發出還是撰寫，李運騰亦問是否由她草擬，楊僅重覆：「我只可以講，係參考咗法律意見之後由我去發出。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李遂問，即有人草擬並由楊簽署？楊指「係嘅，可以咁講」。李再指，即有人草擬、楊閱畢後同意並簽署？惟楊指「我唔能夠直接咁講係定唔係」，指因草擬前亦有就個案的資訊、包括從參選人拿到的資料，與律政司和相關人士作詳細討論，惟李打斷稱不是指她簽署前無討論，只是想問是否有人草擬然後由楊簽署，楊再答：「個文件嘅內容係根據我嘅決定作出同考慮而草擬。」李不耐煩指兩者並無衝突，亦不是說她做錯，只是想節省時間，楊道歉稱：「係，對唔住，呢個我誤解咗你嘅意思。」李最後語氣稍重指問最後一次，不想再問，並問是否有人草擬文件後，楊同意並簽署，楊答「係」，鄒家成和何桂藍等發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;被問是否反對維護國安-何桂藍不同意惟指國安法衝擊司法制度侵犯港人自由&quot;&gt;被問是否反對維護國安 何桂藍不同意惟指《國安法》衝擊司法制度侵犯港人自由&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 其後展示楊蕙心向何桂藍發出提問的信件，以及何的回覆。其中問題一有關何於7月發表的「抗爭派立法會參選人立場聲明」FB帖文，提到「義務反顧的反對國安法」，楊問是否顯示她原則上反對人大常委通過《國安法》，及反對香港特區履行維護國安的憲制責任。何回應不同意，並稱由於《國安法》「內容多處牴觸《基本法》條文，衝擊獨立司法制度、侵犯香港居民受《基本法》保障的各項自由，因此反對《國安法》的單方面頒布及執行」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問，楊曾否考慮何的關注是合理（legitimate and valid）的，惟陳慶偉認為與案無關。Beel 指是關於其證人當時的思想狀態（state of mind），指何當時關心並認為要捍衛（upheld）《基本法》，惟陳慶偉指可留待陳詞，李運騰亦指選舉主任如何理解《國安法》無證據價值，她亦不能得悉何的想法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;選舉主任不信納何桂藍真心誠意支持維護國安但強調答案無分對錯&quot;&gt;選舉主任不信納何桂藍真心誠意支持維護國安、但強調答案無分對錯&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續指，楊曾於DQ何的信中表示，認為她就問題一的回答並不真誠（genuine），問是什麼不真誠？楊解釋，因何表示「不同意」問題的前設，但之後的解釋完全走向另一方向，指《國安法》牴觸《基本法》條文、衝擊法治和侵犯人權自由；但正如楊在信中解釋，《國安法》已加入第4及5條保障香港居民據《國際公約》享有的權利自由、亦確保施行法例時會維護法治原則，因此不認為何的解釋成立，亦不信納她有客觀意圖真誠支持特區在一國兩制方針下維護國家安全。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰表示，所有人都有機會犯錯，包括法官、律師及政務主任，楊是指何在理解《國安法》上有錯，抑或指這並非其真誠的想法？楊強調選舉主任職能是裁定參選人是否合乎資格，而她發信就是想從何獲得直接資訊，以考慮她是否真誠擁護《基本法》，因此何的答覆「冇所謂啱定係錯」，只是看能否從她的答覆信納她有「誠意客觀的意圖」去符合聲明要求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指民主派會全被dq-官稱可指政府有秘密議程-惟其後指說法誤導&quot;&gt;辯方指民主派會全被DQ 官稱可指政府有「秘密議程」 惟其後指說法誤導&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 指問題是楊認為何的答案是否真確，惟主控萬德豪指與案無關，法官着楊避席。陳慶偉問 Beel 的用意，指即使楊的評估完全錯誤，那又怎樣？陳仲衡亦指本案並不取決於其決定是否正確。Beel 回應，想指出何桂藍的DQ是無可避免，因政府會DQ所有民主派，沒有人能成功參選，林卓廷說「吓」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續指，辯方可直接向楊指出其案情，即政府有一個秘密議程（secret agenda），要DQ所有民主派參選人，Beel 指他會這樣做。不過陳仲衡指楊蕙心只曾向4人發信，與 Beel 稱所有人都會被DQ的說法不同；Beel 回應據楊的供詞，是因選舉押後一切才停止。法官指那是另一議題並下令休庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;休庭後，陳慶偉指 Beel 提到政府DQ所有民主派的秘密議程，「我認為不僅問得太遠，更是完全誤導（completely misleading）。」李運騰亦指 Beel 的說法與何的同意事實稱33名參選被告中，只有9人被DQ不符。Beel 重申由於選舉延期，大部分被告的資格尚未確定，李運騰指那是揣測，陳慶偉亦着 Beel 只問相關的問題，不要以誤導的方式指出案情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍此時走近被告欄，法官向 Beel 指其當事人似乎有話想說。Beel 索取指示後轉述何稱，「秘密議程」的說法並非由辯方提出，而是由法官提出。陳慶偉指他的確有用該字眼，但 Beel 當時也同意。何繞着手並一度搖頭，再步回座位。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊指何桂藍就問題一回覆已清晰顯示非真心誠意擁護基本法-故無需考慮問題二&quot;&gt;楊指何桂藍就問題一回覆已清晰顯示非真心誠意擁護《基本法》 故無需考慮問題二&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 其後再展示楊蕙心DQ何桂藍的信件，問她為何說明DQ理由時沒提及問題二。問題二是問何6月發表「墨落無悔」聲明書，呼籲公開簽聲明「會運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案，迫特首回應五大訴求」，是否代表除非政府回應訴求，否則她會聯同其他議員否決所有政府法案及財政預算案。何回應「否」，並指自己將按《基本法》及《立法會條例》等履行議員職務。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊解釋，當時是想何提供資料讓她考慮是否有真實客觀意圖擁護《基本法》和效忠特區，而何就問題一的回覆已非常清晰顯示，她不支持政府根據「一國兩制」方針履行維護國安的憲制責任，因此楊信納何並非真心誠意擁護《基本法》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊並指，何就問題二的回覆「非常之簡短」，若要確立其意圖便要請她進一步提供資料，但由於問題一的答案已「好明顯印證咗我就住呢方面嗰個疑慮」，認為若再追問只是浪費時間，也不會影響其結論，故沒追問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊指不能單憑在fb說話沒考慮仔細解釋下判定意圖&quot;&gt;楊指不能單憑在FB說話、沒考慮仔細解釋下判定意圖&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰關注，若參選人就問題二答「是」，會有什麼後果，楊指會令她信納參選人有意聯同他人為了推行政治訴求而濫用《基本法》賦予立法會的權力。Beel 問是否如任何人持有該聲明的立場就會被DQ？楊不同意，指因此要向何發信提問，清晰了解其真實意圖，因她不能單憑她在 Facebook 的說話、沒考慮她仔細解釋下判定她沒有此客觀意圖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊確認新東曾dq三人-其餘5人提名未完成處理&quot;&gt;楊確認新東曾DQ三人 其餘5人提名未完成處理&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就被DQ的參選人數量，Beel 展示楊今年1月的供詞，提及有8名來自新界東的參選被告，包括劉頴匡、何桂藍、楊岳橋、陳志全、范國威、林卓廷、鄒家成和馮達浚。李運騰關注馮達浚並不屬新東，劉偉聰指馮轉為報名新界東。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊確認，她曾向劉頴匡、何桂藍、楊岳橋和陳志全4人發信查詢，最終DQ頭3人，而陳的提名則處理中（pending）；至於後4人，楊指因選舉中止運作，故未就他們的提名是否有效作出決定，也未向他們發信查詢，指他們應較遲交提名表格，有部分表格甚至未完成初步審核。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;被問有否考慮陳志全其他場合發言-楊稱只掌握墨落無悔聲明&quot;&gt;被問有否考慮陳志全其他場合發言 楊稱只掌握「墨落無悔」聲明&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後由代表陳志全的大律師馬維騉盤問。楊同意，於7月22日收到陳志全的提名表格，5日後向陳發信，要求他翌日5時前回覆；至於另外收信的何桂藍、劉頴匡及楊岳橋3人，楊蕙心同於22日收到提名表格，3日後發信，3人翌日回覆，並於30日獲截提名無效。而選舉提名期於7月31日下午5時截止，政府同日晚上約8時半宣布立法會選舉延期。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊同意，當時尚未就陳志全的提名作出決定，而她只曾就「墨落無悔」聲明向陳發問，關注他是否有意無差別否決政府議案及預算案，同意這是唯一一份她掌握的文件令她有此疑慮。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬問，楊當時有否考慮陳在其他場合如記者會、選舉論壇的發言，楊指她有留意到，但「我當時掌握嘅呢只係呢份文件」，並未參考其他場合或詳細研究陳的言論。她又指其他場合言論均由第三者或媒體傳達，未必很準確表述其意向，加上她沒辦法將參選人所有言論「全部睇晒」才提問，故認為「倚仗參選人第一身所作嘅聲明係最直接同最準確」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊指不會考慮參選人往績-指主要視乎對信件回覆&quot;&gt;楊指不會考慮參選人往績 指主要視乎對信件回覆&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉其後展示陳的回覆，提及「我會沿用過去八年任期內的嚴謹態度，處理未來的財政預算案」。楊指知道一些陳的往績，但不是全程留意他在立法會的言行。被問決定參選資格時會否考慮往績，楊指不會，指她主要都是看陳就她提問和相關議題的回覆。馬問為何不考慮往績，楊未有正面回應，僅引上述句子指這是陳所聲稱的往績，「喺咁嘅基礎之下，我都冇任何理由要因為呢樣嘢而覺得佢冇呢個真實意圖去符合（擁護《基本法》的要求）」，並指就要否取消陳的資格「我未作到呢個結論」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳回應中亦提及，從來沒有說過會否決政府所有法案及議案，又指若政府願意訂立落實真普選的法案、全民退休保障條例、性傾向及性別認同歧視條例和同性伴侶法案等，「本人定必投票支持。」被問該部分是否也與往績有關，楊指不肯定，因這是假設的情況，惟相關法案並沒有出現過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方沒有覆問，楊作供完畢後由便衣警員護送離開。警員一度阻止記者跟隨楊進入升降機，楊其後疑乘車離去。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明早續審，控方將續傳召證物鏈相關警員。&lt;/p&gt;

It provides an unclassified overview of recent U.S. official force planning and intelligence data on U.S. Russian, and Chinese nuclear forces; and compares summary estimates of global nuclear and related missile forces by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), the Federation of American Scientists (FAS), Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, House of Commons Library, U.S. Congressional Research Service (CRS), Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, Roual United Services Institute (RUSI), and Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its final section contains summary data on U.S. force improvement plans taken from the testimony of General Anthony J. Cotton, commander of the U.S. Strategic Command, before the House Armed Services Committee on Strategic Forces on March 8, 2023, and on U.S. plans and strategy on the aspects of missile defense that affect the strategic balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its main purpose is to illustrate the extent to which nuclear forces have again become a key factor shaping international security, and some of the different ways that experts now portray the changes taking place in nuclear modernization and in the balance between the major powers. It shows that the balance between the major powers has shifted from the nuclear balance between the United States and Russia to one where China is emerging as a nuclear great power; and where important shifts are the shifts taking place in the strength and modernization of other nuclear forces like those of the United Kingdom, France, North Korea, Iran, Israel, India, and Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, its summary comparisons of different expert assessments highlight the many areas where key data on nuclear forces and nuclear warfighting are not available or present major issues in terms of uncertainty or conflicting data. Such summary data can only illustrate a limited number of the different ways in which experts now estimate the nuclear balance, but the analysis draws upon some of the most respected unclassified sources now available to illustrate the range of data now available and its limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This survey has been substantially updated and expanded as of May 2023 in response to outside comments and suggestions that reviewed an earlier draft, but the estimates it summarizes continue to change and evolve, and the updated data on force strengths in 2023 and on future modernization are especially uncertain. However, even a book-length comparison totaling some 200 pages must ignore much of the work done by the experts it draws upon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The source of each estimate is listed at the end of each summary, and full text of the work by national governments, Hans M. Kristensen. Matt Korda, Robert Norris, and others in the country-by-country Nuclear Notebooks published in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, in the SIPRI annual yearbooks, the various reports by the Congressional Research Service, and the reports by Claire Mills for the House of Commons Library are particularly helpful in comparing different countries, understanding the limits and uncertainties in such data, and the extent to which many estimates are dated, uncertain, or based on uncertain sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;limits-to-the-coverage-of-this-analysis&quot;&gt;Limits to the Coverage of this Analysis&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other key limits to the data presented include the fact that the official data on U.S., Russian, Chinese, British, and French programs have consistently tended to underestimate the costs, technical, and delivery date risks in the actual modernization efforts. They also understate the probability of major changes in major national programs as countries deploy new systems warfighting capabilities and change their strategies. Estimates of future forces are also based on current plans that do not reflect in the impact of the war in Ukraine, the collapse of many arms control efforts, and ongoing increases in Chinese forces and tensions over areas like Taiwan and the Koreas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These serious uncertainties in the data that are available on nuclear weapons and delivery systems. Many of the data on the type of non-U.S. nuclear weapon — fission, boosted, or thermonuclear — and its yield are uncertain. So are the background data on the level of technical sophistication in designing the weapon, upgrades and serving of weapons over the years, and its reliability in a real-world delivery on target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data on the actual level of success in each country’s explosive tests of nuclear weapons and progress in weapons design are often uncertain, and so is progress in testing weapons designs using simulated weapons with low levels of enrichment remain classified — although both India and Pakistan are reported to have used such methods. The readiness of stored weapons is not assessed, and the ability to use existing weapons assemblies in missiles and other delivery systems that are normally assessed as having conventional warheads is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More generally, the summary estimates of existing forces generally only reflect a limited portion of the history of their development, changes in declared national strategy, long-standing questions about the real-world success of given powers in developing advanced systems, the history of arms control efforts, and national nuclear politics. Many of these details are uncertain and debated at the expert level. The narrative summaries of national nuclear efforts in Wikipedia often provide extensive background in these areas but also have serious gaps, are often badly dated, and vary sharply by country in their coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;uncertainties-in-data-on-delivery-systems&quot;&gt;Uncertainties in Data on Delivery Systems&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are few reliable estimates of the changes that most nuclear powers are making to their delivery systems, and much of the data focuses on the performance of individual missiles, aircraft, SSBNs, and potentially dual-capable systems, rather than the numbers to be deployed, actual deployment, and impact on war fighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the data on non-U.S. missiles are based on estimates of range based on the type and size of the missile rather than actual flight test data. Estimates of accuracy are often based on the maximum capability of the guidance platform rather than actual missile tests; accuracy is not tied to reliable estimates of nuclear weapons yield, and no reliability data based on actual tests of even the missile system alone are normally available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data are lacking on the targeting and retargeting capabilities of given countries, and on their ability to retarget, launch on warning, and accurately detect and characterize nuclear strikes on their own territory and enemy territory, and characterize the difference between counterforce strikes on nuclear and other military forces, and countervalue strikes on civilian populations, key economic and infrastructure targets, and other critical nonmilitary and recovery capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;failing-to-examine-changes-in-warfighting-capability&quot;&gt;Failing to Examine Changes in Warfighting Capability&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, the unclassified data now available on nuclear capabilities focus almost exclusively on nuclear delivery systems and nuclear weapons, rather than analyzing actual warfighting capabilities, and the results of a possible nuclear conflict. The unclassified data on nuclear strategy often consists of little more than national political statements about no first use, a desire for arms control, and a focus on deterrence rather than war fighting — none of which may apply in a crisis and at a time when most of the U.S. and Russia nuclear arms control efforts have been canceled or have an uncertain future, China does not participate in meaning arms control negotiation, and smaller nuclear power make statements that are ambiguous and given no clear picture of what might happen in a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open-source efforts to analyze the warfighting impact of actual nuclear exchanges largely ended after the collapse of the former Soviet Union, as most tactical and theater nuclear forces were withdrawn from active service, and as arms control seemed to create a truly stable balance of strategic nuclear deterrence. As a result, there are only a handful of credible data on how a nuclear war might now lead to given patterns of counterforce strikes against an opposing side’s nuclear and other military forces, and the impact of fall out and the countervalue impact of counterforce strikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is little recent unclassified analysis of how a nuclear war might lead to countervalue strikes against populations, economies, and recovery capabilities, and of the levels of damage and casualties that might result in a world with radically different economic structures and target bases from that exist at the time of the Cold War. There is also little meaningful open-source analysis of the shifts taking place in key aspects of vulnerability to nuclear attacks, like dependence on imports, manufacturing capability, and changes in the economic value of given cities, key infrastructure targets, and key industrial centers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, only limited data are available on the major changes that have taken place in the ability to use space and other assets to provide reliable warning of attacks, analyze nuclear engagements in near real-time, change counterforce and countervalue targeting dynamically in near real time to reflect the actual course of nuclear exchanges, and assess the value of given counterforce and countervalue targets in both warfighting terms and in terms of recovery capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lack of open-source analysis of the changing nature of actual nuclear warfighting seems increasingly dangerous. China is emerging as a major nuclear power and radically changing the potential nature of nuclear warfare between the major powers. Past efforts to actually analyze nuclear warfighting ignore the fact that there are now three major groups of nuclear forces: the United States, France, the United Kingdom, Russia, and China. This not only presents major problems in modeling the possible patterns in nuclear warfighting and escalation, but it also presents the problem for the United States that any exchange with only Russia or China would make the power that stayed out of the conflict the de facto winner in a major nuclear exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;dual-capability-and-a-return-to-theater-nuclear-warfare&quot;&gt;Dual Capability and a Return to Theater Nuclear Warfare&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has shown that Russia is willing to make nuclear threats, and much of the arms control efforts in Europe and between the United States and Russia have now ended or have an increasingly uncertain future. China has so far refused to engage in arms control negotiations. The end result is that there is a major risk that the deployment of theater nuclear weapons, dual-capable delivery systems that can be armed with nuclear or conventional warheads, and strategic nuclear warheads with yields suitable for theater warfare will increase steadily in the near future. The analysis shows that smaller nuclear powers have remained a relatively limited global threat but pose a steadily growing strategic threat to given nations in their region. Proliferating states like Israel, North Korea, India, and Pakistan are modernizing and increasing their forces, and the potential nuclear efforts of nations like Iran illustrate the rising risk proliferation may pose in the future. North Korea has also been reported to have declared that it has already deployed delivery systems that have both nuclear and conventional warheads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;other-key-areas-of-uncertainty&quot;&gt;Other Key Areas of Uncertainty&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several other major areas of uncertainty that affect the estimates of nuclear forces in this summary analysis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One is proliferation. Key cases involve the steady rise in Indian and Pakistani near force capabilities, the uncertainties surrounding the real-world nuclear capabilities of Israel, North Korean efforts to develop and deploy ICBMs, and the risk of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons and its impact on the development of nuclear forces by Iran’s Arab neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another is the ways in which nuclear forces can be used in combat and the extent to which the ability to manage a nuclear war in near-real time is becoming far more dynamic. There has been almost no open-source discussion of the potential impact of space sensors, AI, and big data in radically changing the current and future ability to provide reliable launch-on-warning capability and real-time data on the exact nature of nuclear strikes and their effects.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These advances in technology may allow the managers of an actual nuclear war to rapidly retarget, shift in near real-time from counterforce to countervalue targets, and fight even the highest levels of nuclear combat dynamically in near real-time. These issues are now being publicly explored in designing forces for advanced forms of conventional Joint All-Domain Operations, but there has been little public discussion of how they might change the modernization of nuclear war fighting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A third area of uncertainty, as the 2023 edition of the ODNI’s Annual Threat Assessment highlights, is the risk that new forms of biological warfare pose a rising strategic threat and one that could be used anonymously and to produce a wide range of lethalities and economic and social effects.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A fourth is the fact that most existing U.S. and Russian, and NATO and Russian, arms control agreements have either been halted or suspended, while China has not engaged in arms control negotiations with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A fifth is the fact that the number of precision-strike theater and tactical missiles that are dual capable is steadily increasing, but there is no indication of whether U.S. and Russian tactical and theater nuclear weapons will be returned to active deployment in Europe or elsewhere, and whether today’s U.S., Russian, and Chinese “triads” will become a “quad” that includes theater and dual-capable nuclear forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similarly, no reliable estimates exist of the future development and deployment of missile and air defense weapons capable of intercepting nuclear delivery systems, or of cyber, antisatellite, and other systems that can degrade the ability to escalate and conduct nuclear warfare.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, as noted earlier, no reliable unclassified estimates seem to exist of the impact that counterforce strikes launched to destroy an opponent’s nuclear forces would have on the opponent’s civil population, economy, and recovery capabilities. Past studies indicated that the real-world difference between counterforce and counter value could be limited by fall-out and longer-term weapons effects in major counterforce exchange, but they are now seriously outdated. It should be noted that the comparative summary analysis in this report shows that few nuclear powers provide full national statements of their nuclear modernization efforts, the full spectrum of their current and future nuclear capabilities, and actual warfighting capabilities. Statements like “no first use” are matters of doctrine that any nation can declare and ignore in a crisis, and no nuclear state has declared possible limits to its uses of nuclear weapons, possible ways in which it might agree to halt nuclear escalation once it begins, and limits to its countervalue targeting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;us-strategic-command-summary-of-us-nuclear-modernization-priorities&quot;&gt;U.S Strategic Command Summary of U.S. Nuclear Modernization Priorities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adapted from statement of Anthony J. Cotton, Commander, U.S. Strategic Command, before the House Armed Services Committee on Strategic Forces, March 8, 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NUCLEAR COMMAND, CONTROL, AND COMMUNICATIONS (NC3):&lt;/strong&gt; The NC3 enterprise is essential to the President’s ability to command and control the Nation’s nuclear forces. Acknowledgement of this vital mission and the unique challenges facing NC3 modernization were the impetus behind the Secretary of Defense’s establishment of my role as the DoD NC3 Enterprise Lead in 2018. With these responsibilities and authorities, we are taking a holistic enterprise approach to develop and deliver the next generation of NC3 — a flexible, resilient, and assured architecture spanning all domains and enhancing strategic deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NC3 Next Generation / Modernization:&lt;/em&gt; The modernization of the NC3 enterprise underpins the nuclear triad and sustains assured command and control capabilities in the evolving threat environment. We are partnering with NC3 stakeholders in the Office of the Secretary of Defense and levying requirements on the Services to modernize all NC3 capability areas, integrating global nuclear forces with the means to provide strategic deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next five years, we will transition from Milstar to the Advanced Extremely High Frequency satellite constellation, gaining greater capacity, survivable worldwide NC3 reach, and the ability to provide direction to our forces in degraded environments. Our national leadership conferencing, currently using a voice-only legacy technology, will transition to voice and video displays. In our warning layer, we are moving away from the Defense Support Program and towards the Space Based Infrared System to maximize warning time. Efforts are already underway on our submarines, E-6B aircraft, and bombers to replace previous generation radios with improved systems that are more resilient to jamming and other electromagnetic effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next ten years, the launch and use of Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared geosynchronous and polar satellites will replace legacy systems with a space-based missile warning constellation to detect and track threats around the globe. The Space Development Agency’s Proliferated Warfighting Space Architecture is aimed at building a constellation of satellites in low and medium earth orbit that can monitor maneuvering hypersonic missiles flying below the range of today’s ballistic missile detection satellites and above the radar of terminal-phase targeting systems. These satellites will complement other efforts to detect and track maneuvering hypersonic missiles that are difficult targets for current missile warning capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we will use polar satellite communications capability with the Enhanced Polar System Recapitalization program to provide message relay. Our submarines, E-6B aircraft, bombers, and missile fields will receive communication systems that increase survivability of weapon systems in a crisis situation. We are focused on achieving our vision — a modernized NC3 &lt;em&gt;enterprise that remains resilient, reliable, and available at all times and under the worst conditions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NC3 Cybersecurity and Technological Improvements:&lt;/em&gt; We have confidence in our ability to protect, defend, and execute the nuclear deterrent mission. The resilience and redundancies of the systems comprising the Nuclear Command and Control System, combined with ongoing cybersecurity enhancements, ensure our ability to respond under adverse cyber conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;E-4B Nightwatch:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The E-4B Nightwatch aircraft serves as the National Airborne Operations Center and is a key component of the National Military Command System for the President, Secretary of Defense, and Joint Chiefs of Staff. The E-4B recapitalization program — the Survivable Airborne Operations Center — will serve as the next generation airborne command center platform. In case of national emergency or destruction of ground command and control centers, the aircraft provides a highly survivable command, control and communications center to direct U.S. forces, execute emergency war orders and coordinate actions by civil authorities. For these reasons, we must continue to develop and deliver this platform on time to prevent any capability gaps associated with this important national asset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;E-6B Mercury:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The E-6B Mercury accomplishes two missions: Emergency Action Message (EAM) relay to all legs of the nuclear triad (Take Charge and Move Out/TACAMO) and an alternate USSTRATCOM command center providing EAM origination and ICBM secondary launch capability (Looking Glass). E-XX is the follow-on platform to the E-6B airframe and will execute the TACAMO mission only. In coordination with the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment and the Joint Staff, USSTRATCOM and the NC3 Enterprise Center are conducting an evaluation of alternatives (EoA) to consider all missions and platforms to deliver the Looking Glass capabilities currently performed by the E-6B. Recommendations from the EoA should be available by mid- summer. We must complete recapitalization by the E-6B’s projected end of service life in FY38.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;RECAPITAIZATION OF TRIAD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a once in every-other-generation event that will ensure we have capable forces into the 2080s to defend the U.S. homeland and deter strategic attack globally. I am closely monitoring the transition of our major programs: OHIO to COLUMBIA, D5 LE to D5 LE2, Minuteman III to Sentinel, B-2 to B-21, Air Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM) to LRSO, and modernization of NC3 capabilities. It is essential to sustain our current platforms until new systems are at full operational capability. Correspondingly, we are coordinating with the Services on efforts to mitigate operational impacts should delays occur in the delivery timeline for new capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;LAND-BASED TRIAD COMPONENT:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The ICBM remains our country’s most responsive option for strategic deterrence. The Minuteman III (MMIII) force provides a responsive, highly reliable deterrent capability, supported by a secure command and control system. Geographically dispersed ICBMs deny potential adversaries the possibility of a successful first strike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MMIII’s weapon system replacement, the LGM-35A Sentinel ICBM, will deliver MMIII’s key attributes while enhancing platform security, streamlining maintenance processes, and delivering greater operational capability needed for the evolving threat environment. Sentinel’s program scope and scale cannot be overstated — our first fully integrated ICBM platform includes the flight system, weapon system, C2, ground launch systems, and facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sentinel program is pursuing mature, low-risk technologies, design modularity, and an open system architecture using state-of-the-art model-based systems engineering. Sentinel will meet our current needs, while allowing affordable future technology insertion to address emerging threats. USSTRATCOM is actively supporting the Sentinel engineering and manufacturing development process and looks forward to the first Sentinel developmental flight test. Sentinel will deploy with numerous advantages over MMIII and will provide a credible deterrent late into this century. Sentinel fielding is a whole of government endeavor. We appreciate continued Congressional support, both for Sentinel and sustainment of MMIII.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEA-BASED TRIAD COMPONENT:&lt;/strong&gt; The Navy’s OHIO-class SSBN fleet, equipped with the Trident II D5 SLBM, patrols the world’s oceans undetected, providing an assured second strike capability in any scenario. Our SSBN fleet continues to provide a resilient, reliable, and survivable deterrent. However, the life of the OHIO-class SSBN fleet has been extended from a planned 30 years to an unprecedented 42 years. The average age of the SSBN fleet is now 32 years. As the hulls continue to age, the OHIO-class will face sustainment and readiness challenges until it is replaced by the COLUMBIA-class. Similar to Minuteman III, we must maintain OHIO-class hulls until the COLUMBIA is available. The Navy has already invested in the Integrated Enterprise Plan to shorten construction timelines for COLUMBIA hulls two through twelve to meet USSTRATCOM at-sea requirements. Continued investment in revitalizing our shipbuilding industry is a national security imperative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first COLUMBIA-class&lt;/em&gt; submarine must achieve its initial strategic deterrent patrol in FY31 with an initial loadout of D5 LE missiles and a steady transition to the D5 LE2. The program of record delivers at least twelve SSBNs — the absolute minimum required to meet sustainment requirements. A life-of-hull reactor and shorter planned major maintenance periods are intended to deliver greater operational availability. COLUMBIA will deliver improved tactical and sonar systems, electric propulsion drive, and advanced hull coating to maintain U.S. undersea dominance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Trident II D5 LE2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; program will field a modern, reliable, flexible, and effective missile capable of adapting to emerging threats and is required to meet COLUMBIA-class SLBM loadout requirements. Stable funding for D5LE2 is vital to maintaining program benchmarks and ensuring a viable SSBN deterrent through the 2080s. COLUMBIA’s ultimate success depends on a missile that is both capable and flexible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, shore infrastructure readiness is fundamental to supporting current OHIO-class SSBN and future COLUMBIA-class SSBN operations. Provision of military construction and operation &amp;amp; maintenance funding facilitates the Navy’s modernization of shore infrastructure supporting the nuclear deterrence mission. One immediate example is the modernization and expansion of the SSBN training and maintenance facilities in Kings Bay. These facilities are critical for maximizing the combat readiness of SSBNs and their crews daily, requiring a commitment to multiple years of funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anti-Submarine Warfare:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Anti-submarine warfare threats continue to evolve. The Navy’s Integrated Undersea Surveillance System (IUSS) provides vital information concerning adversary submarine and surface ship operations, enabling U.S. forces to maintain favorable tactical and strategic positions while supporting deterrent patrol operations. Surveillance performed by IUSS also provides the theater undersea warfare commander situational awareness required for maritime defense of the homeland. Advances in adversary submarine stealth underscore the importance of IUSS recapitalization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our submarines are formidable weapon systems; however, we must address potential adversaries’ anti-submarine warfare advances to maintain an effective and viable SSBN fleet well into the future. Adversary investments in submarine quieting, acoustic arrays, and processing capabilities may challenge our acoustic superiority in the future and consequently, SSBN survivability. Development and employment of advanced sonar sensors, advanced materials science and coatings, and other efforts within the Navy’s Acoustic Superiority Program are vital to maintain our undersea advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AIR-BASED TRIAD COMPONENT:&lt;/strong&gt; The bomber fleet is our most flexible and visible leg of the triad. We are the only country with the capability to provide long-range bombers in support of our Allies and partners, enabling the U.S. to signal resolve while providing a flexible option to de-escalate a conflict or crisis. In a force employment model known as the Bomber Task Force (BTF), USSTRATCOM supports global deterrence and assurance objectives. BTFs allow dynamic employment of the Joint Force and clear messaging as potential adversaries watch these missions closely. As bombers conduct missions throughout the globe, they enhance national objectives by demonstrating unity with Allies and partners, and testing interoperability. As a complement to the Air Force’s Agile Combat Employment (ACE) concept, we must consider increasing forward-based maintenance capability to support persistent, episodic global presence while retaining the ability to increase nuclear readiness posture as needed. As we sustain legacy systems and field new capabilities, it will be important to invest in bomber support forces and infrastructure to adequately sustain flexibility and effective nuclear deterrence posture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;B-52H Sustainment:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The B-52H continues on as the workhorse of our bomber fleet. The B-52’s longevity is a testament to its engineers and maintenance professionals, but it must be modernized to remain in service into the 2050s. Essential B-52 upgrades include the Commercial Engine Replacement Program (CERP), Radar Modernization Plan, global positioning system military code signal integration, and survivable NC3 communications equipment. These improvements will keep the B-52 flying and able to pace the evolving threat. CERP will replace the B-52’s 1960s-era TF-33 engines, which will enable longer unrefueled range, reduce emissions, and address supply chain issues afflicting the legacy engines. The B-52’s very low frequency and advanced extremely high frequency modernization programs will provide mission critical, beyond-line-of-sight connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;B-2 Sustainment:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The B-2 fleet remains the world’s only low-observable bomber, able to penetrate denied environments while employing a wide variety of munitions against high-value strategic targets. The DoD must protect this unique operational advantage as the Air Force transitions from the B-2 to the B-21 fleet. Successful transition requires full funding for B-2 sustainment and modernization programs until the B-21 completes development and certification for both conventional and nuclear missions, and is fielded in sufficient numbers to preclude any capability gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;B-21:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The B-21 Raider will provide both a conventional and nuclear-capable bomber supporting the triad with strategic and operational flexibility across a wide range of military objectives. The program is on track to meet USSTRATCOM operational requirements, and continues to successfully execute within cost, schedule, and performance goals. The B-21 will be the backbone of our future bomber force, providing a penetrating platform with the range, access, and payload to go anywhere needed in the world. Consistent funding of the Air Force’s B-21 program is required to prevent operational shortfalls in the bomber force and ensure delivery of this critical combat capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Air-Delivered Weapons:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The air-delivered weapons portfolio consists of the ALCM, the B83-1 gravity bomb, and the B61 family of weapons, providing a mix of standoff and direct attack munitions to meet near-term operational requirements. The ALCM provides current stand-off capability to the strategic bomber force, but is reaching its end-of-life. LRSO will replace the ALCM as our country’s sole air-delivered standoff nuclear capability. It will provide the President with flexible and scalable options, and is capable of penetrating and surviving against advanced air defenses — a key attribute and important component in USSTRATCOM operational plans. The LRSO is complementary to the ICBM and SSBN recapitalization programs and an important contribution to strategic stability. The B61-12 will soon replace most previous versions of the B61, providing a modernized weapon with greater accuracy and increased flexibility. Finally, USSTRATCOM is actively supporting the National Defense Authorization Act requirement to conduct a study on options to hold at risk hard and deeply buried targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tanker Support:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; A robust tanker fleet is essential to sustaining global reach for all USSTRATCOM missions. The 65 year-old KC-135 is the backbone of the Air Force’s air refueling force but is facing increasing maintenance and sustainment issues. Limited air-refueling aircraft increases bomber response timing and constrains bomber deterrence posture agility. Concurrent mission demands between strategic, theater, and homeland defense require continued tanker modernization and expansion efforts. USSTRATCOM fully endorses and supports the Air Force’s effort to modernize and sustain the tanker fleet, including certification of the KC-46 to support the nuclear mission. A conflict with a peer adversary would put previously unseen demands on the tanker force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WEAPONS INFRASTRUCTURE AND NUCLEAR SECURITY ENTERPRISE (NSE):&lt;/strong&gt; Today’s nuclear weapon stockpile remains safe, secure, and effective. However, our country has not conducted a large-scale weapons modernization in over two decades. Stockpile and infrastructure modernization must ensure our systems are capable of pacing and negating adversary threats to our Nation, Allies, and partners. Over the past five years we have made significant investments in the NSE, but most programs take a decade or longer to field a meaningful capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NNSA, as part of and informed by the Nuclear Weapons Council (NWC), has developed a comprehensive plan to put these identified capacities and capabilities in-place. When realized, it will enable our country to sustain and modernize the nuclear weapons stockpile to meet strategic deterrence needs. In the interim, I look forward to working with NNSA and other NWC partners to find the best solutions to mitigate operational risks. I commend Congress for its support of the NNSA’s budget for weapons activities for FY23. Stockpile and NSE programs can take a decade or more to deliver and will require consistent, uninterrupted funding to provide the needed capacities and capabilities on time to sustain and modernize the strategic deterrent force. We must continue to look for ways to accelerate our stockpile and NSE modernization and recapitalization programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we shift focus beyond life extension to modernizing existing weapons and fielding new systems, we must overcome challenges that delay program execution. There are many NSE programs with just-in-time schedules or that are late-to-need, including pit production, uranium processing, and radiation case manufacturing. Failure to execute and deliver timely NSE modernization programs results in accumulation of operational risk by requiring the retention of aging weapons and components in the stockpile decades longer than intended. In FY22, the NSE took action on a number of issues impacting the readiness and modernization of the nuclear deterrent force. Some areas — for example, the W93, B61-12, and W88 Alt 370 — saw progress, while others such as the W80-4 and W87-1 stockpile modernization programs are experiencing milestone delays and increased schedule risk. I look forward to working with NNSA and other NWC partners to improve our rates of success in these latter areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Production of essential components is a critical issue. NNSA has identified critical capability gaps affecting components essential for stockpile modernization. It is also vital that the NSE re-establishes a plutonium pit manufacturing capability of no less than 80 pits per year as close to 2030 as possible. Weapon production is a multi-decade task that must address current enterprise limitations as we simultaneously modernize the stockpile, infrastructure, and platforms while sustaining the current force until it can be replaced. For over a decade, our adversaries have dedicated significant resources to modernizing and expanding their nuclear capabilities. As our systems continue to age, funding a modern stockpile, supporting infrastructure, and a robust science, technology, and engineering base is essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NUCLEAR SECURITY:&lt;/strong&gt; Nuclear security continues to be one of my top priorities; we will commit the resources required to protect our fielded weapons, weapon platforms, and personnel. Adhering to the Nuclear Weapon Security Standard ensures denial of unauthorized access to nuclear weapons and prevents loss of custody. A defense-in-depth strategy starts at every nuclear weapon and builds outward with a cohesive design to deter, detect, delay, deny, and defeat security threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;MH-139A Grey Wolf Replacement Helicopter:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The Joint Force achieved a significant ICBM security milestone with the Air Force’s award of a contract to replace the UH-1N helicopter fleet with the new MH-139A “Grey Wolf.” The MH-139A offers enhanced speed, range, endurance, payload, and survivability versus the UH-1N. We will continue to work with the Services to deliver this capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countering Small Unmanned Systems: The rapid proliferation and growing technological sophistication of small unmanned systems is an increasing threat to the nuclear enterprise. To counter the threat, the Department continues to field Counter-small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (C-sUAS) capabilities and is refining tactics, techniques, and procedures. Similarly, the advancement of unmanned surface and underwater vehicles may soon emerge as a threat to our SSBNs and supporting infrastructure, requiring a comprehensive force protection system to defend both pier-side and in-transit SSBNs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Weapon Generation Facility (WGF):&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; As we modernize nuclear weapons and platforms, the Air Force will replace aging weapon storage areas with new WGFs which are vital to security, sustainment, and fielding of the Sentinel, B-21, and LRSO triad modernization programs, and their associated weapons. The Air Force will conduct weapon maintenance, storage operations, and (as required) weapons generation activities in a single reinforced WGF facility at each strategic base. This will further increase security, recapitalize aging infrastructure, and enhance efficiency throughout the mission. The WGFs are a critical part of the larger nuclear modernization effort and must be fully funded to deliver on time in support of each program of record delivery schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JOINT ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM OPERATIONS (JEMSO):&lt;/strong&gt; Per the Unified Command Plan (UCP), CDRUSSTRATCOM is responsible for advocating for JEMSO and electromagnetic warfare capabilities, providing contingency electronic warfare support to other CCMDs, and supporting CCMD joint training and planning related to controlling the EMS. Potential adversaries understand our dependency upon the EMS and have developed technology to effectively contest our use of it. Additionally, increased civil and commercial use of spectrum bandwidth significantly congests the EMS and constrains DoD use. Multiple USSTRATCOM assessments have identified JEMSO readiness shortfalls, which are growing. Our adversaries have dramatically increased their offensive and defensive capabilities in recent years; the DoD must similarly improve our ability to operate in a degraded electromagnetic warfare environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must continue to pursue a DoD-wide effort to achieve EMS superiority and mission. To support the goals of the DoD EMS Superiority Strategy, USSTRATCOM is executing twelve assigned tasks, including establishing an organization, led by a 2-star, called the Joint Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations Center (JEC). The JEC will lead execution of the eleven other USSTRATCOM assigned DoD EMS Superiority Strategy tasks. Additionally, USSTRATCOM has led development of JEMSO cells at other CCMDs to enable these functions. We are also working with the DoD Chief Information Officer to develop a software system for use by CCMD JEMSO cells in planning, coordinating, and controlling the EMS. Following multiple assessments from Northern Edge — USINDOPACOM’s tier 1 exercise — USSTRATCOM is pursuing accreditation authorities for Joint Force EMSO readiness that will help close capability gaps. USSTRATCOM is also establishing an EMSO training and education capability to coordinate DoD EMS joint training, streamline training processes, and promote standardization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MISSILE DEFENSE:&lt;/strong&gt; Missile defense capabilities are a key part of integrated deterrence to deny our potential adversaries coercive abilities or the benefit of attacks against the homeland, Allies, and partners. The proliferation of missile technology and employment techniques designed to circumvent missile defenses demands a Department-wide missile defeat approach with continued investment in systems integration and collaboration with Allies and partners. This comprehensive approach uses the entire range of available activities to counter the development, acquisition, proliferation, and use of adversary offensive missiles of all types, as well as limiting damage from such use. An important element of this approach is integration of space- and terrestrial-based sensors for warning, attribution, and tracking of ballistic, maneuvering, hypersonic, cruise missile, and UAS threats to optimize the effectiveness of our limited inventory of kinetic interceptors. A comprehensive sensor architecture that gives commanders and civilian leaders situational awareness over all threats and incursions to our air and space domains is imperative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MMIII’s weapon system replacement, the LGM-35A Sentinel ICBM, will deliver MMIII’s key attributes while enhancing platform security, streamlining maintenance processes, and delivering greater operational capability needed for the evolving threat environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sentinel’s program scope and scale cannot be overstated — our first fully integrated ICBM platform includes the flight system, weapon system, C2, ground launch systems, and facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sentinel program is pursuing mature, low-risk technologies, design modularity, and an open system architecture using state-of-the-art model-based systems engineering. Sentinel will meet our current needs, while allowing affordable future technology insertion to address emerging threats. USSTRATCOM is actively supporting the Sentinel engineering and manufacturing development process and looks forward to the first Sentinel developmental flight test. Sentinel will deploy with numerous advantages over MMIII and will provide a credible deterrent late into this century. Sentinel fielding is a whole of government endeavor. We appreciate continued Congressional support, both for Sentinel and sustainment of MMIII.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HYPERSONIC WEAPONS:&lt;/strong&gt; Long-range conventional hypersonic weapons will provide senior leadership additional strike options to hold distant and/or defended high-value, time-sensitive targets at risk without crossing the nuclear threshold. Conventional HSWs ensure long-range power projection in contested environments and enables more efficient and effective application of the nuclear force. While HSWs are not a replacement for nuclear weapons, these systems show promise as the conventional complement that the nuclear force needs to expand integrated deterrence options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to quickly strike defended targets at long range is an important capability that the Joint Force and multiple CCMDs require. Rapid development and fielding of conventional HSWs is a top USSTRATCOM priority. The goal of fielding the first offensive hypersonic strike system is on the horizon with the Army scheduled to field a Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon battery in late 2023, followed by the Navy Conventional Prompt Strike program beginning in the mid-2020s. The Air Force has demonstrated successes in the Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon program and hypersonic cruise missile technology pathfinder efforts. A robust scientific and industrial base is vital to ensure that HSWs are fielded in sufficient quantities. Additionally, a program for continuous technological improvement is important to meet the evolving security environment over the coming decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;USSTRATCOM is committed to ensuring HSWs are ready to employ on day one of fielding as these weapons directly contribute to USSTRATCOM’s UCP-assigned strategic deterrence and global strike responsibilities. To operationalize these new capabilities in the near term, we are working across the Department to develop a concept of operation for HSW support to integrated deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;USSTRATCOM is working through policy, planning, and C2 processes, and — in conjunction with the Services and other CCMDs — is testing HSWs through a rigorous exercise program. Hypersonic weapons will have an immediate impact to operational plans by deterring and holding adversaries at risk while providing the nation with credible, strategic, non-nuclear response options when faced with armed conflict. Additionally, HSW-related agreements with Allies will further reinforce collective security, promote interoperability, and facilitate optimal deployment of these capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;us-nuclear-strategy-and-missile-defense&quot;&gt;U.S. Nuclear Strategy and Missile Defense&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. Missile Defense Strategy and Nuclear Forces: 2022 Missile Defense Review.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://media.defense.gov/2022/Oct/27/2003103845/-1/-1/1/2022-NATIONAL-DEFENSE-STRATEGY-NPR-MDR.PDF&quot;&gt;Department of Defense: 2022 Missile Defense Review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As outlined in the NDS, integrated deterrence is a framework weaving together all instruments of national power — with diplomacy at the forefront — to work seamlessly across warfighting domains, theaters, the spectrum of conflict, and our network of alliances and partnerships. Tailored to specific circumstances, integrated deterrence applies a coordinated, multifaceted approach to reducing competitors’ perceptions of the net benefits of aggression relative to restraint. Integrated deterrence is enabled by combat-credible forces and backstopped by a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Missile defenses, as one component of this integrated, multilayered framework, are critical to the top priority of defending the homeland and deterring attacks against the United States. Whether protecting the homeland, deployed U.S. forces, or our Allies and partners, missile defenses deny the benefits of an attack by adversaries and limits damage should deterrence fail. The continued evolution and progress of missiles as a principal means by which adversaries seek to project conventional or nuclear military power makes missile defense a core deterrence-by- denial component of an integrated deterrence strategy. Missile defense capabilities add resilience and undermine adversary confidence in missile use by introducing doubt and uncertainty into strike planning and execution, reducing the incentive to conduct small-scale coercive attacks, decreasing the probability of attack success, and raising the threshold for conflict. Missile defenses also reinforce U.S. diplomatic and security posture to reassure Allies and partners that the United States will not be deterred from fulfilling its global security commitments. In the event of crisis or conflict, missile defenses offer military options that help counter the expanding presence of missile threats, and may be less escalatory than employing offensive systems. Damage limitation offered by missile defenses expands decision making space for senior leaders at all levels of conflict, and preserves capability and freedom of maneuver for U.S. forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the framework of integrated deterrence, missile defense and nuclear capabilities are complementary. U.S. nuclear weapons present a credible threat of a robust response and overwhelming cost imposition, while missile defenses contribute to deterrence by denial. If deterrence fails, missile defenses can potentially mitigate some effects from an attack. Missile defense contributes directly to tailored U.S. deterrence strategies to dissuade attacks on the United States from states like North Korea, and contributes to extended deterrence for U.S. Allies and partners, and our respective forces abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address intercontinental-range, nuclear threats from Russia and the PRC, the United States will continue to rely on strategic deterrence — underwritten by safe, secure, and effective nuclear forces — to deter such threats as outlined in the 2022 Nuclear Posture Review (NPR). Ensuring the continued credibility of this deterrent will require investments in missile warning, missile tracking, and resilient NC3 to keep pace with the evolving PRC and Russian threats, and avoid the possibility of evading U.S. sensor networks in a surprise attack. For states like North Korea, missile defenses and the U.S. nuclear arsenal are complementary and mutually reinforcing, as both capabilities contribute to deterring an attack against the United States and our Allies and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Homeland Missile Defense.&lt;/strong&gt; The Department’s top priority is to defend the homeland and deter attacks against the United States. For the purposes of this review, homeland missile defense refers to the defense of the 50 states, all U.S. territories, and the District of Columbia against missile attacks. Missile defenses can raise the threshold for initiating nuclear conflict by denying an aggressor the ability to execute small-scale coercive nuclear attacks or demonstrations. Further, the presence of missile defense complicates adversary decision-making by injecting doubt and uncertainty about the likelihood of a successful offensive missile attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Missile defense systems such as the GMD offer a visible measure of protection for the U.S. population while reassuring Allies and partners that the United States will not be coerced by threats to the homeland from states like North Korea and potentially Iran. In the event of crisis, globally integrated domain awareness capabilities increase warning and allow for flexible decision-making to respond, as necessary and appropriate, with escalatory options such as kinetic strike. Should deterrence fail, missile defenses can help mitigate damage to the homeland and help protect the U.S. population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. homeland ballistic missile defense architecture centers on the GMD system, consisting of interceptors emplaced in Alaska and California, a network of space-based and terrestrial-based sensors, and an integrated C2 system. Together, these U.S. homeland defense capabilities provide the means to address ballistic missile threats from states like North Korea and Iran. Though the United States maintains the right to defend itself against attacks from any source, GMD is neither intended for, nor capable of, defeating the large and sophisticated ICBM, air-, or sea- launched ballistic missile threats from Russia and the PRC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States relies on strategic deterrence to address those threats. As part of an integrated approach to deterrence, the United States recognizes the interrelationship between strategic offensive arms and strategic defensive systems. Strengthening mutual transparency and predictability with regard to these systems could help reduce the risk of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As North Korean ballistic missile threats to the U.S. homeland continue to evolve, the United States is committed to improving the capability and reliability of the GMD system. This includes development of the Next Generation Interceptor (NGI) to augment and potentially replace the existing Ground-Based Interceptors (GBI). In addition to the GMD system, the United States will leverage and improve its full spectrum of missile defeat capabilities, complemented by the credible threat of direct cost imposition through nuclear and non-nuclear means, to continue to counter North Korean missile threats to the homeland. To deter attempts by adversaries to stay under the nuclear threshold and achieve strategic results with conventional capabilities, the United States will examine active and passive defense measures to decrease the risk from any cruise missile strike against critical assets, regardless of origin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the context of homeland defense, an attack on Guam or any other U.S. territory by any adversary will be considered a direct attack on the United States, and will be met with an appropriate response. Additionally, Guam is home to key regional power projection platforms and logistical nodes, and is an essential operating base for U.S. efforts to maintain a free and open Indo-Pacific region. The architecture for defense of the territory against missile attacks will therefore be commensurate with its unique status as both an unequivocal part of the United States as well as a vital regional location. Guam’s defense, which will include various active and passive missile defense capabilities, will contribute to the overall integrity of integrated deterrence and bolster U.S. operational strategy in the Indo-Pacific region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regional Missile Defense.&lt;/strong&gt; The United States will continue to strengthen defenses for U.S. forces, and with Allies, and partners against all regional missile threats from any source. As part of an integrated, interoperable, and multi-layered approach to deterrence, IAMD capabilities need to keep pace with expanding regional missile threats, while protecting and enabling U.S., Allied, and partner maneuver forces to conduct operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regional missile threats continue to expand in capability, capacity, and complexity, challenging existing U.S., Allied, and partner regional IAMD capabilities and placing all at risk. Likely designed for employment below the U.S. nuclear threshold, adversaries are pursuing and demonstrating advanced, long-range space and missile systems capable of traversing entire Combatant Command Areas of Responsibility (AORs). Attacks from these systems could increasingly blur the line between regional and homeland defense and challenge existing IAMD architectures. In addition to missile threats, U.S. forces, Allies and partners also face the proliferation of lower-tier threats (e.g., rockets, armed UAS, etc.) as adversaries seek to take advantage of these relatively inexpensive, flexible, and expendable systems while exploiting inherent difficulties with attribution and its implications for deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cooperation with like-minded nations is crucial. The United States will continue to seek ways to integrate and interoperate with Allies and partners as well as encouraging greater integration among Allies and partners to fill gaps against the increasing spectrum of regional threats. Additionally, as the ability to share sensor information and data is critical to regional defense, the United States will continue to streamline processes for information and data sharing, while encouraging Allies and partners to enhance their information protection posture and cyber security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States will also continue to develop active and passive defenses against regional hypersonic missile threats, and pursue a persistent and resilient sensor network to characterize and track all hypersonic threats, improve attribution, and enable engagement. Acquisition strategies for new sensors, interceptors, and C2 systems must be fully aligned — with sensors as the priority. As appropriate, the United States will pursue joint research and development on hypersonic defense programs with key Allies and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IAMD.&lt;/strong&gt; Nested within our broader missile defeat approach, IAMD is the integration of capabilities and overlapping operations to defend the homeland, Allies and partners, protect the Joint and combined forces, and enable freedom of action by negating an adversary’s ability to create adverse effects with air and missile capabilities. IAMD represents an effort to move beyond platform-specific missile defense toward a broader approach melding all missile defeat capabilities — defensive, passive, offensive, kinetic, non-kinetic — into a comprehensive joint and combined construct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing and fielding IAMD systems is a complex problem set. To address the rapidly evolving threat, the acquisition community must continue to exploit adaptive acquisition approaches to ensure the timely and cost-effective development, procurement, sustainment, and improvement of IAMD systems, while providing a clear investment strategy over the near-, medium-, and long-terms. The Department must develop, design, acquire, and maintain Joint IAMD systems that are integrated, interoperable, and sufficiently mobile, flexible, and affordable to protect the homeland and dispersed joint and combined maneuver forces from the full spectrum of air and missile threats. Interoperability breeds efficiency and economy of resources. To enhance this effect in IAMD, the Department must develop and exercise innovative combinations of Service, national, and Allied and partner capabilities to meet mission needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One area of importance related to IAMD is the increasing challenge of counter-UAS (C-UAS). UAS are an inexpensive, flexible and plausibly deniable way for adversaries endeavoring to carry out tactical-level attacks below the threshold for major response, making them an increasingly preferred capability for state and non-state actors alike. UAS capabilities are also growing in variety, quality, and quantity. The homeland and regionally forward deployed forces require the fielding of technical and integrated C-UAS solutions with cross-DoD and interagency synchronization to ensure they can meet the range of threats and appropriately hedge against future advancements. Within the homeland, protecting the population from UAS threats is a combined interagency mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future Technologies.&lt;/strong&gt; The United States requires responsive, persistent, resilient, and cost- effective joint IAMD sensor capabilities to detect, characterize, track, and engage current and emerging advanced air and missile threats regionally, and to improve early warning, identification, tracking, discrimination, and attribution for missile threats to the homeland. Sensors must be integrated into a cohesive architecture with increasingly capable C2 in order to provide leaders with a maximized decision space for informed actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sensors should be able to seamlessly transition from theater-level threats, to homeland defense, to global threats, by sharing and transmitting data with C2 as threats move in and out of the atmosphere. Because of their global nature, persistence, and greater access to denied regions, resilient space-based infrared, radar, and associated data transport systems will be critical to any future integrated sensor network. Likewise, modern over-the-horizon radar capabilities are essential to improving warning and tracking against cruise missile and other threats to the homeland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advanced sensor capabilities need to facilitate different mission areas simultaneously. These include strategic and theater missile warning and tracking to: alert national leadership and cue missile defenses in the event of a missile launch; offer space domain awareness to provide indications and warning of threats; support mission assurance of the space architecture; and prompt ISR to provide persistent, and often unwarned, global information essential to the whole of government. Therefore, the ability to operate these sensors through common, joint and combined all-domain integrated and survivable C2 networks and architectures is paramount. The United States will continue to leverage industry, academia, government, and allied and partner solutions to augment existing Department of Defense capabilities and foster rapid future capability employment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advanced and innovative technologies and more effective battle management will be crucial to moving the United States towards a cost-effective and integrated set of offensive and defensive capabilities. To cope with rapidly increasing adversary development of missile-centric Anti-Access/Area-Denial (A2/AD) threats, the Department must seek new technologies and hedge against continuing adversary missile developments and emerging capabilities such as hypersonic weapons, multiple and maneuvering warheads, and missile defense countermeasures. Future air and missile defense capabilities must also be more mobile, flexible, survivable, and affordable, and emphasize disaggregation, dispersal, and maneuver to mitigate the threat from adversary missiles. Finally, these technologies and platforms — including those enabling NC3 — must be inherently cyber-secure, joined by resilient, redundant and hardened networks, and monitored by an agile defensive cyber force operating under a clear, unified C2 construct.&lt;/p&gt;

It raises awareness of the societal reintegration preparations needed by the countries of origin for the mental, physical, and potentially ideological challenges these foreign volunteers may have faced while responding to the defense of Ukraine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, there was an outcry across Europe, the West, and nations globally, questioning the legitimacy of the war. Although there had been Russian occupation of Ukrainian territory and associated conflict since 2014, the invasion sparked a new, distinct phase of interstate conflict with geopolitical considerations and socioeconomic impacts. Initially, there was relatively wide-ranging support of the call from Ukraine for foreign volunteers to join its military efforts based on nations’ perceived alliances to Ukraine, considerations of European security, and concerns over threats from Russia and its interests and allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the initial days of the conflict, however, with official processes to join the International Legion of Defence of Ukraine still not fully in place, there was confusion over the legality of this type of active participation in a foreign conflict. For many, this dynamic resonated with the topical issue of foreign fighters, who traveled to fight with Daesh in Syria and Iraq, and the challenges of how to handle their status and return or perhaps with the less-discussed status of those who traveled to fight against Daesh outside of sanctioned military operations. Thus, it is important to clarify the distinctions among types of individual participation in foreign conflicts under the international legal system set up to govern armed conflict, including categories of foreign terrorist fighters, foreign fighters, foreign volunteers, and mercenaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine worked quickly to establish a process by which foreign volunteers could officially and in a widely and internationally sanctioned manner join the ranks of the International Legion, a division of its national military. Even with this process of volunteering to fight as part of a national military rather than joining paramilitary groups in place, questions remain around the legality of this process and how much process and preparation, which would normally be a part of military engagement, has been put in place to prepare foreign volunteers to fight. Additionally, due to the ideologically charged nature of the invasion, justification narratives from Russia, and the historical context of the conflict, there are concerns of exposure to far-right ideological influence for those traveling to participate. The pre-invasion context from 2014 to 2022 was certainly imbued with ideological threats, with thousands traveling to fight there in support of far-right ideological purposes. Although paramilitary units often encouraged this kind of participation, they largely have now been absorbed into the official military establishment, and the far-right ideological narrative has been discouraged. Nevertheless, there remains a concern that foreign volunteers may be exposed, due to the conflict context itself or through the belief systems of their comrades, to extremist ideologies that they may carry home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brief addresses the implications and impacts of the call to fight in Ukraine in order to gauge potential threats and to encourage preparations for the successful return and reintegration of volunteers into civilian life. Reportedly, there have been more than 20,000 volunteers from 52 countries,  but other estimates suggest that the number of those who entered Ukraine with the intention of fighting is closer to 2,000. Therefore, this brief provides an overview of the status of those fighting in the Ukraine conflict because this impacts potential responses, such as tracking, monitoring, and engaging with these individuals. Finally, it raises awareness of the preparations needed by the countries of origin for the mental, physical, and potentially ideological challenges these foreign volunteers may have faced while responding to the call to defend Ukraine to ensure their successful societal reintegration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because these private citizens are traveling to fight in an armed conflict outside of their domestic military services, they could be left without a range of support that would be available to them as domestic military veterans. Without these services in place, they face potential challenges with a civilian system largely ill-equipped to understand or address their needs. The counterterrorism community has focused on disengagement, deradicalization, rehabilitation, and reintegration of those classed as foreign terrorist fighters. Yet, there is seemingly little preparation in place at the national government level for assessment and provision of similar services, where needed, for foreign volunteers returning from the conflict. Especially due to the emergency nature of this call, processes of predeployment training, mental and physical well-being monitoring, or event postdeployment support for those who have been involved in combat are unclear. It is therefore essential that countries with citizens who have volunteered to participate in this conflict are preparing for their return and providing services to them in support of their mental and physical well-being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;definitions-of-participation&quot;&gt;DEFINITIONS OF PARTICIPATION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the current counterterrorism policy focus on the return of foreign fighters, in relation to returning those who traveled to fight with Daesh in Syria and Iraq, it becomes important to clarify the distinctions among foreign terrorist fighters, foreign fighters, foreign volunteers, and mercenaries under the international legal system set up to govern armed conflict. In order to be prosecuted as a foreign terrorist fighter, which is a legal classification established in response to the large number of individuals traveling to fight with Daesh, an individual must be fighting on behalf of a proscribed terrorist organization. In the international framework, this classification was established by UN Security Council Resolution 2178 in 2014. It remains controversial, however, with many still opting to retain use of foreign fighter versus foreign terrorist fighter because it binds member states to criminalize a wide range of activities related to foreign fighting and blurs the distinction between terrorism and participation in armed conflict that may be legal under international humanitarian law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who traveled prior to the establishment of a defined pathway for volunteering for Ukraine’s International Division qualify for penalization as foreign fighters, which is often subject to national legal interpretation and influenced by political appetite. The individuals who joined as foreign volunteers with the International Legion under national constitutions that allow citizens to fight in foreign militaries have entered the conflict legally and would not be subject to prosecution for participation within the boundaries of international humanitarian law. Regardless of the legality under international humanitarian law, however, foreign military volunteering remains illegal under the national constitutions of some countries. Mercenaries are those who are contracted to fight in a foreign country for pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concern this raises with regard to individuals who traveled prior to the official pathway to volunteer is that those who fought with paramilitary groups prior to February 2022 have been prosecuted in some cases for crimes as foreign fighters and linked to far-right ideological threats of violent extremism. Some countries (e.g., the Czech Republic, Germany, the United Kingdom) have acted to criminalize participation in the 2014–2022 conflict. Yet, some countries, often those with less political will or well-defined far-right–focused laws, chose to largely ignore this participation. For example, as application of U.S. counterterrorism law was dependent on the legal definition of the group they were joining as a foreign terrorist organization, thousands of Americans traveled to fight with ideologically far-right paramilitary groups between 2014 and 2022 and often were not prosecuted or provided with services or deradicalization programming after their return. This was seen by some counterterrorism professionals as a fault in the counterterrorism framework’s design, with its myopic focus on Islamist violent extremism and in stark contrast to those prosecuted as foreign terrorist fighters due to the designation of organizations such as Daesh and al-Qaida as foreign terrorist organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With it being legal under international humanitarian law to become a foreign volunteer and with relatively open and easy travel to the conflict zone, tracking those who have gone to fight might be difficult, especially if they traveled prior to the formation of the formal process. Travel outside the formal process of volunteering for the International Legion raises the legal question of foreign fighter status rather than foreign volunteer status, which adds the difficulty of whether to prosecute these individuals. Also, even for those who volunteered through the official avenue, there will inevitably arise situations of illegal battlefield conduct in violation of international humanitarian law, which will present complex legal challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications-of-the-appeal&quot;&gt;IMPLICATIONS OF THE APPEAL&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it would be incorrect to assume that everyone who traveled to fight from 2014 to 2022 did so for far-right ideological reasons or that everyone who has traveled to fight after February 2022 would come into contact with these ideological influences, it is important to acknowledge that far-right influences present in Ukraine have not disappeared. For example, the Azov Battalion, which formed in 2014 and was later integrated into the Ukrainian National Guard, and the Azov Movement, a far-right nationalist network of military, paramilitary, and political organizations that grew out of the Azov Battalion, have extensive ties to the transnational far-right ecosystem. Also, the narratives surrounding the initial Russian invasion were highly ideological. Although these narratives were largely wielded as a political tool, there have been or are far-right ideological motivations on both sides of the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As has been discussed in research on extremism within the security forces, there is a potential vulnerability created in environments of extreme in-group/outgroup formation, such as in the case of the military unit bonding experience. Research has shown this can especially be true in combat-focused units, often elite military units subject to intensive unit building, with a dehumanization of the enemy out-group potentially encouraging ideologies of superiority (e.g., white supremacism, ultranationalism, misogyny). The combination of these “othering” narratives, individual expectation, and the physical and mental toll of combat environments could potentially increase the appeal of far-right ideologies and decrease resilience to radicalization or recruitment. Additionally, the combat and weapons skills obtained by these individuals make them a high-value target for those trying to recruit individuals into violent extremist groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In relation to this, it is important to note the highly gendered narrative of the conflict and of the appeal for volunteers. The rhetoric of this conflict, although varied, in the case of appealing to foreign volunteers often focused on a sense of hypermasculine patriotism, with a call for men with combat experience to take up arms in defense of those who could not defend themselves (e.g., pregnant women being bombed). Largely due to the perception of military service being a masculine space, the call clearly was aimed to appeal to the gendered essentialisms that able-bodied men should protect women and children and that it is their duty to fight and die to defend the oppressed. This creates an environment in which the hypermasculine definition of patriotism becomes an impossible bar for performance. Expectations such as this and the mental pressures that they place on an individual can result in a spectrum of dangers—at one end, hypermasculine conceptions of patriotism that radicalize individuals to misogyny, ultranationalism, and xenophobia and, at the other end, feelings of inadequacy and failure that can fuel radicalization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implications of the call to arms are significant in the aftermath of a conflict and to an individual fighter’s pathway to postcombat rehabilitation and reintegration into civilian life. The realities of combat environments, whether an experienced professional or not, are unpredictable and often different from the expected experience. Many different elements can make the point of separation from a militarized identity and the transition to civilian life a point of concern. Sometimes, such a strong identity is formed with the military/unit group that it becomes difficult to regain individual identity; sometimes, traumas experienced during conflict leave lasting physical and mental (e.g., post-traumatic stress disorder) scars; and sometimes, failed expectations of heroism or of lack of a resolution to the conflict can damage individual identity. Additionally, in some cases, these concerns will be compounded by the fact that some of those who traveled were veterans who were already struggling to form a civilian identity and seized on the opportunity to participate again in the military environment. This could potentially compound existing challenges if they do not feel adequately satisfied by their participation or if there is an undesired or unresolved end to the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;impacts-of-combat-and-necessary-support-systems&quot;&gt;IMPACTS OF COMBAT AND NECESSARY SUPPORT SYSTEMS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joining the military in times of crisis or conflict impacts the environment, tempo, and conditions into which individuals enter, even in the case of individuals joining their own standing national militaries, demanding that service members integrate, adapt, and prepare quickly. These effects would be amplified exponentially when a volunteer joins an international division of a foreign military during an active conflict. In most cases, the support systems in place as part of national military training, welfare, and so on would be much more comprehensive than what the foreign volunteers received, and it is essential to be aware of the impacts of the environment in which they enlisted after their return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the military, there is normally a “boot camp” environment at the entry point in which unit formation is emphasized. This may exist in a limited fashion for the foreign volunteers, but it would presumably be a truncated experience due to the pressing nature of the conflict dynamics. This could have implications in relation to the dangers presented earlier. Additionally, in the military there is often a focus on predeployment training and preparation or, in some cases, mission training and preparation. These systems are in place to ensure a clear understanding of purpose; a time for mental preparation, if possible, for what is to come; and an understanding of roles and responsibilities within the unit, among other things. For a quickly deployed international division, it is likely that these systems were limited and often challenged by the different backgrounds, languages, ranks, and expectations represented by the influx of volunteers from numerous countries and from various backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There would likely be a stark contrast between those volunteering with previous military service and those who might have come from backgrounds with less, little, or no organized combatant training. Organized militaries are required to train their service members on international humanitarian law and the codes that govern interstate conflict and armed combat, but not all the volunteers may have received that training. This type of training often also focuses on preparation for the traumatic nature of combat, including preparation of individuals mentally and physically for responding to torture or being captured or held as prisoners of war. Without this, the volunteer’s experience might be exponentially more traumatic, they could endanger themselves or their unit, or they could engage in war crimes or illegal battlefield conduct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there is a question of the volunteers returning to their civilian lives without a postdeployment debrief and physical and mental health check and without clear access to support services of which they might be in need. Most militaries have put these systems in place, either through military systems for those remaining on active duty or through veteran’s programs for those leaving service. To varying degrees, these programs monitor the physical and mental well-being of these individuals and help them to process the impacts of combat. Also, even though these efforts are often much less substantial than they should be, there is the onus on these systems to assess service members as potential security threats, in cases in which radicalization or recruitment may be happening or they may commit acts of violence, such as domestic violence or self-harm. The military jurisdiction over these support systems is often separated from civilian social care services and is especially equipped for the needs of those who have participated in combat. So, if foreign volunteers are returning to their home countries but do not qualify for support systems associated with domestic military service, there is a clear danger that they might go unmonitored or not be able to access through civilian pathways the type of services that would be best acclimated to meet their needs and understand their risks and vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the implications and impacts of the call to fight in Ukraine, it becomes apparent how important it is to ensure that there is preparation at the national level for the return of citizens who have traveled to participate. Some lessons on monitoring, rehabilitation, and reintegration concerns and programming can be taken from the adjacent contexts of services that militaries provide after combat or to veterans or in some cases services that counterterrorism or civil society organizations are preparing or implementing for returning foreign fighters. Yet, many different dynamics to this interstate conflict must be fully considered to ensure that the law has been upheld and that the transition of these individuals back to civilian life does not present a danger to themselves or to society. There should be preparations made now, presumably to address some individuals who have already returned and to have support systems in place for others who are yet to return from Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted, transition points between military and civilian life can be especially vulnerable. No matter the experience of individuals, there will undoubtedly be physical and mental implications of participation in an active combat zone; left unsupported, these can quickly present challenges that turn into security threats to the individuals, their families and friends, or even to society in cases of radicalization. There are often service systems in place with established national militaries that would normally oversee the pre- and post-deployment needs of those participating in combat. In the case of the pressing needs of Ukraine and the hasty establishment of their volunteer International Legion in the conflict, however, responsibility for these types of services will likely fall largely on the national governments of the countries to which these volunteers might return. Therefore, awareness of potential concerns must be raised, including devising who can best offer the most effective and appropriate services, so that preparations can be made to support these individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wherever possible, the traveler and legal status of participants in the conflict should be established. Policy and necessary resources should be in place to track their return so that there is a clear process for relevant security, health, legal, and other actors and a point of contact for the individuals after their return.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consideration should be given by national authorities to who would be the relevant and responsible authorities in the case of these individuals, especially for those who have traveled legally as foreign volunteers, and how much oversight there can be of their postdeployment debrief or assessment in coordination with offering of services.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For those who did not travel legally, either based on their national laws or their traveling prior to the establishment of the official process for foreign volunteering, or for those who may have committed battlefield crimes, agreements should be established by which it will be the national responsibility to investigate and prosecute or where this would fall under the remit of an international tribunal. Some lessons could be taken from evidencegathering techniques applied in other contexts (e.g., the prosecution of foreign fighters).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Communications policy should be put in place to govern the public governmental response to the participation of individuals from their country, whether this participation is considered to reflect positively or negatively, and to moderate any public response. This is to ensure coordination but also the well-being and safety of the individuals returning (e.g., to ensure coordinated governmental voice and lack of dynamic politization on support for volunteering or support for rehabilitation and reintegration of these individuals or to avoid negative or harmful stigmatization of returning fighters in countries where public opinion might be less supportive or divided).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jurisdiction of relevant physical and mental health and other support services should be considered because often the types of services that would be best equipped and knowledgeable about the needs of these individuals would be under the military or veteran services rather than civilian services. If these individuals are to be connected with civilian service providers, sufficient training should be given to these providers on the impacts and implications of participation in active combat zones.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Awareness should be raised among policymakers, security actors, and service providers on the context of the far-right ideological dynamics espoused as part of the narrative of this interstate conflict to avoid stigmatization of those who have volunteered to fight and to help anticipate any potential threats of fighters returning radicalized or with links to transnational far-right networks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

How effective have the Taliban’s efforts been and whether has IS-K been able to adapt?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It assesses the performance of the Taliban in one case study of counterterrorism (IS-K activities in the campuses) and the adaptation of IS-K in response. It is based on a series of 25 interviews with IS-K militants, Taliban security and intelligence officials, and university staff and students, carried out after the regime change in Kabul in August 2021. In order to set out the operating environment of Taliban counterterrorism, the paper also describes in detail, with new evidence, the sophisticated IS-K approach to recruitment on Afghanistan’s university campuses, combining face-to-face and remote techniques. IS-K’s recruitment is aimed at a relatively small niche, largely Salafi and Salafi-leaning students, and can yield only a limited number of recruits, certainly not exceeding the low hundreds annually. Nonetheless, these are high-quality recruits, on which the highly ideological and disciplined IS-K must rely to sustain its operations. Indeed, the Taliban seem to have paid considerable attention to the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By denying the space they once had on the campuses to IS-K activists, the Taliban have constrained IS-K’s ability to recruit, but this could well be only temporary, especially as IS-K adapts and refines its recruitment techniques, relying more on private social media channels, moving more of its social media activists abroad, and warning its members and sympathisers about the risk of Taliban infiltrators and provocateurs. Moreover, the underlying conditions favouring IS-K recruitment persist, including serious harassment of Salafi students by some of their Hanafi colleagues; heavy-handed treatment of suspects by Taliban police and intelligence; widespread student frustration at their conditions and lack of prospects; and Taliban pressure on non-violent extremist groups that have roots among students, such as Hizb ut-Tahrir, Jami’at Eslah and others, which might drive some of their members towards IS-K.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taliban’s approach to counterterrorism on university campuses has, in other words, been focused on repression, with seemingly little, if any, effort towards prevention. The ability of the Taliban to reduce IS-K activities using heavy-handed measures runs the risk of delivering both short-term positive results and long-term counterproductive ones, not least because the Taliban struggle to restrain the behaviour of their sympathisers and indeed anyone holding anti-Salafi views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The branch of the Islamic State for Central and South Asia, which calls itself Islamic State in Khorasan (IS-K) and is also known as the Caliphate’s Wilayat (Province) Khorasan, might have been eclipsed from UK media, but it remains a major terrorism concern in South and Central Asia, because of its highprofile attacks, mostly involving the ruthless slaughter of civilians. Over the years, IS-K has taken heavy casualties from both the Taliban and the US, but has been able to (at least in part) regenerate its force, drawing from limited but rather loyal constituencies both inside and outside Afghanistan. The role of the group’s once dominant Pakistani component has been reduced by the establishment of Wilayat Pakistan, a new ‘province’ of the Islamic State that effectively competes with the Caliphate’s original branch, Wilayat Khorasan, for funding and recruits. Another development that reduced the number of IS-K’s Pakistani recruits present in Afghanistan was the leadership’s decision to transfer of hundreds of them to the former tribal areas of Pakistan, where they have been increasingly active against the Pakistani security forces. As a result, the group’s sources of recruits inside Afghanistan have become more important than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two main such sources have so far been the Salafi community and university students (there is some overlap between the two). The Islamic State is today essentially a Salafi organisation, so it is not surprising that it primarily attracts Salafis in Afghanistan too, the more so as there has been friction for years between Salafis and Hanafis, especially Deobandis like the dominant faction of the Taliban, and Sufis, who are also well represented among the Taliban. Until the 1970s, virtually all Afghanistan’s Sunnis had been Hanafis. The arrival of strictly ‘fundamentalist’ Salafi missionaries from Pakistan gradually led to the conversion of much of the population of eastern and northeastern Afghanistan. Among the Hanafi, traditionalist currents such as Sufism and less strict ‘fundamentalist’ tendencies such as Deobandism were especially antagonised. This paper examines the hitherto understudied IS-K presence in Afghanistan’s university campuses and the counterterrorism effort that the Taliban regime has mounted against it, asking how effective the Taliban’s efforts have been and whether IS-K has been able to adapt. The focus is on the Taliban’s counterterrorism, as opposed to the wider Taliban counterinsurgency effort, because the tools the Taliban deployed against IS-K in the campuses have been typical counterterrorism ones: policing rather than fighting, with infiltration and intelligence gathering being prominent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taliban’s counterterrorism efforts focused on IS-K after their return to power in August 2021 are a rather unexplored field. There is little evidence that the Taliban’s approach to counterterrorism has drawn on Western understandings, even if there is some superficial overlap in tactics. Counterterrorism tactics shared by the Taliban and Western authorities include intelligence-driven raids, infiltration of extremist groups and manipulation of media reporting, among other things. Nevertheless, as the Taliban’s Emirate (the Taliban’s de facto government, established in August 2021) does rely on a number of advisers who served in the previous government, some indirect influence cannot be ruled out. The lack of desire to take inspiration from Western counterterrorism is unsurprising, given that the Taliban were the target of Western counterterrorism efforts for almost 20 years, and that those efforts are seen by the Taliban as having failed to keep them out of power. Since the first Taliban Emirate (1996–2001) did not experience a terrorist threat (although it did face insurgencies), and the challenge posed by IS-K to the Taliban in 2015–21 was of a different nature – clashes between the two groups’ armed units – the second Emirate’s counterterrorism effort had to start with a blank slate when IS-K resumed terrorist attacks a couple of weeks after the Taliban had taken power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, the character and effectiveness of Taliban counterterrorism is important in determining both the fate of the Emirate and state resilience in Afghanistan in the near term. Another reason for examining this area is to assess the impact and effectiveness of an approach to counterterrorism that, if not necessarily consciously designed as an alternative to Western doctrine, is certainly not directly shaped to conform with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper is part of a wider effort to gather data on and analyse the Taliban’s counterterrorism and counterinsurgency efforts, and it does not presume to offer a final and complete analysis of the subject. The intent is to contribute data and emerging thoughts on a regime that had no incentive to adopt Western counterterrorism doctrine or practice (or that of any other power). Instead, the Taliban have had to find their own way in dealing with a terrorist threat. Why is their experience relevant to anybody interested in counterterrorism? Concern remains, in the region and beyond, about the existence of a local branch of the Islamic State. Further, non-Western practice in counterterrorism is an emergent field of study and this paper aims to contribute to it. Afghanistan under the Taliban can be taken as an exemplary case study of a regime confronting terrorism (and specifically IS) while lacking any external backing (financial or otherwise), having little resources of its own, and suffering from a lack of specific skills and knowhow. This will be a not-so-rare state of affairs in the future, and studying emerging counterterrorism practices is bound to yield useful insights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that this paper does not discuss Taliban counterterrorism doctrine, which may well not even exist, but rather their practice as it has been emerging. Indeed, the Taliban appear to be moving tentatively through a trial-and-error process, often driven by provincial-level officials, with limited intervention from the centre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;METHODOLOGY&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper examines IS-K’s campaign in the campuses and how the Taliban have been responding to it, and offers an assessment of the impact of the two campaigns (terror and counterterror). Given that the Taliban’s counterterrorism campaign is still underway, any findings of this paper can be only partial and preliminary. There are also obvious limitations to the research methodology adopted, with research by necessity limited to oral sources, with limited support from news reports and no access to primary written sources, assuming there are any. It is not clear to what extent the Taliban have a formal decision-making process in counterterrorism, and they cannot be expected to share any documents that they might have seized from their enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper seeks to sketch developments in one particular (but important) aspect of Taliban counterterrorism, a new art with which they have been busy since taking power. Researching this topic required a number of methodological compromises, as reaching out to sources in the context of Afghanistan under the Taliban is extremely difficult. IS-K recruiters and members were, of course, the most difficult ones to speak to. As a result, the body of data collected is inevitably incomplete; gaps abound and following up on specific themes was often not possible. The analysis contained in the paper inevitably reflects this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper is primarily based on 20 interviews with students, university staff and Taliban security officers, all carried out in October and November 2022, as well as three interviews with IS-K militants, carried out in June 2022, and two interviews with Taliban intelligence officers, carried out in November 2021. The interviews were conducted by three researchers who did not know each other, in order to avoid the risk of collusion in manipulation of the content of the interviews. The interviewees were told that their answers would be used in a publication, the type of which was not specified. All the interviews have been anonymised and all data that could lead to the identification of interviewees has been removed. The risk that respondents could use the interviews to influence or misrepresent the facts was assumed from the start as a precautionary measure. This risk was mitigated by using different types of sources, representing contrasting points of views, by interviewing individuals separately and without them being aware of other interviews taking place, and by inserting questions where the answer was already known. Public-domain sources have also been used, where available, to check the credibility of interviewees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper is organised into five sections. The first briefly discusses what is known about IS-K activities on university campuses before regime change in 2021. The next section discusses IS-K activities after regime change, up to autumn 2022, when research for this paper was completed. The third section is dedicated to Taliban counterterrorism efforts on campuses, and is followed by a fourth section, on how IS-K adapted to the Taliban’s repression, and the prospects of IS-K overcoming the obstacles placed by the Taliban in its path on Afghanistan’s university campuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;is-k-activities-on-university-campuses-before-15-august-2021&quot;&gt;IS-K ACTIVITIES ON UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES BEFORE 15 AUGUST 2021&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recruitment of Afghan university students by IS-K was an established fact before the fall of Kabul to the Taliban in August 2021. In 2015, at least two students were reported to have volunteered to fight in Syria with IS. One was a computer science student, allegedly radicalised while attending an Islamic culture course at Kabul University. Then, in 2018, some students in the economics department were detained by the security services of the previous regime. In 2019, the National Directorate of Security detained three lecturers from the Sharia faculty and two former students on charges of recruiting for IS-K. The confession of one of the former students appears to show that the lecturers first tried to attract students towards Salafism, and only once that was achieved would they try to recruit them into IS-K. IS-K has long been attracting recruits from Kabul University’s Sharia faculty. Recruitment has been facilitated by the poor quality of university education in Afghanistan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ramin Kamangar, a researcher based in Kabul, said that historically many extremist groups had deep roots in Afghan society. The academic curriculum was designed in such a way that every group could manipulate academic textbooks, including Sharia law textbooks, which are mandatory courses for every faculty across the country. ‘The textbooks of Islamic law are not academic,’ Kamangar said. ‘They present that Islam is the best religion and speak in the form of ideological black and white.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous regime did not clamp down heavily on pro IS-K clerics (ulema) and teachers, for fear of a backlash from the wider Salafi ulema community, whom it considered useful allies against the Taliban.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already in 2020, researcher Borhan Osman found that Kabul University, Nangarhar University and Al-Biruni University (a private university) were major sources of IS-K recruits. The leader of the original IS-K Kabul cell was in fact a graduate of Al-Biruni University, located in Gulbahar, a town split between the provinces of Parwan and Kapisa. The dormitories of state universities were a hotbed of IS-K activity, to the extent that the authorities restricted their availability to students. A staff member at Kabul University confirms that under the previous regime (2001–21), recruitment by violent extremist groups was widespread in Kabul’s dormitories. Osman also learned that IS-K in Kabul recruits largely among Tajiks, usually from old strongholds of Jami’at Islami, originally a moderate Muslim Brotherhood organisation that ‘romanticised jihad’ in the 1980s and then exposed itself to IS-K criticism for failing to implement an Islamic regime in the 1990s. Typically, recruits went through Salafi activism first, and/or joined non-violent groups such as the pan-Islamist Hizb ut-Tahrir (HuT) and militant student organisation Jami’at Eslah. A group of female Salafi–jihadist activists sympathetic to IS-K was also identified at a private university in Kabul in this period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;is-k-activities-on-afghanistans-campuses-after-the-taliban-takeover&quot;&gt;IS-K ACTIVITIES ON AFGHANISTAN’S CAMPUSES AFTER THE TALIBAN TAKEOVER&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even before the Taliban took power, tension between Salafi and Hanafi students was running high on campuses, and physical fights were not uncommon. Since the change of regime, the Taliban have been restricting Salafi activities, and Hanafi students have felt encouraged to become more assertive, with some harassing Salafis, and Salafi students mostly forced to keep a low profile and avoid responding. A few Salafi students have continued to quarrel with Hanafis and have attracted the attention of IS-K, which is particularly interested in individuals with a militant Salafi profile. There are also reported still to be several university staff members and students who are active Salafi preachers and proselytisers. Sympathy for non-violent extremist groups, especially HuT and Jami’at Eslah, was widespread among university students as the Islamic Republic was unwinding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-importance-of-students-to-is-k&quot;&gt;THE IMPORTANCE OF STUDENTS TO IS-K&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IS-K sources have been proudly acknowledging their efforts to recruit university students. In the words of a commander:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These university students, whom we call ‘consciousness’ members, are very good in the recruitment of fighters and members through social media because they know Islam very well and are very good at convincing people to join jihad in Afghanistan. We have been very good in recruitment of students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is noteworthy as a statement about the value of educated members to IS-K. Another commander relayed a common IS-K motto: ‘One consciousness fighter or commander is much better than 100 uneducated fighters’. These highly ideological members are considered the backbone of IS-K, because they are very good at encouraging other members to ‘fight for Islam against non-believers and against those who are misusing the name of jihad and Islam for power, like the Taliban’. Interviews showed that the recruitment focus remains on the Sharia faculty, but students coming from other faculties would be approached if they showed strong religious interests, even if they were not Salafis already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A source from the Taliban’s intelligence agency, the GDI, confirmed in November 2021 that IS-K was focusing much of its recruitment effort on Kabul University, in particular the Sharia department, where many had been recruited in previous years. At that time, Kabul University was closed, but intelligence sources were reporting that IS-K was already ordering its teams to resume recruitment activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;is-k-assets-on-campuses&quot;&gt;IS-K ASSETS ON CAMPUSES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afghanistan’s higher education sector includes both public (39 as of 2020) and private (up to 145) universities, with 400,000 students in 2020, about one-third of whom study at private colleges. Numbers are believed to have fallen after the Taliban takeover, even before women’s access to higher education was suspended in December 2022. While public universities are free, admission exams represent an obstacle for many who would like to get a degree. Private universities, by contrast, are only accessible to wealthy families.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GDI believed in late 2021 that there were IS-K cells in Kabul University and also some teachers linked to IS-K. They believed that IS-K was also active in some private universities in Kabul, and viewed blocking IS-K recruitment as a top priority. Another GDI source stated that they had identified three IS-K networks active in Kabul University and in Al-Biruni University. At that time, only the private universities were open, and the GDI was focusing its monitoring efforts on these. The Kabul University networks were allegedly led by Sharia faculty teachers and supported by networks active on social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In mid-2022, sources confirmed IS-K being active in Kabul and Gulbahar but added that Nangarhar University and Badakhshan University were the other recruitment hotspots. It is worth noting the considerable overlap of the findings of this research with Osman’s findings, reported above, and the addition of Badakhshan University. An IS-K recruiter confirmed in November 2022 that IS-K still had many sympathisers in Nangarhar University, even if they needed to lie low to avoid detection. Indeed, at that point IS-K still considered Nangahar to be its main student recruitment ground. According to this source, there were several cells of IS-K recruiters active in the university, each with three members. Considering their respective sizes, Kabul University (with almost three times as many registered students as Nangarhar) appears to have been less affected: the six IS-K cells reportedly operating on the Kabul University campus, with two to three members each, were mostly active within the Sharia department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there might be variations between locations, the IS-K structure on the campuses seems to be organised into the following dedicated sections: ‘targeting’, ‘media and culture’, ‘chatting and inviting’, and ‘face-to-face communication’. The ‘targeting’ section is the largest, in terms of staffing. Most of the cells operate within the Sharia and law faculties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;is-k-recruitment-techniques&quot;&gt;IS-K RECRUITMENT TECHNIQUES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Targeting’, as discussed by IS-K sources, is essentially an intelligence activity, aimed at identifying potential recruits. The targeter’s job is described as being ‘to single out and target the most religious students, who have the greatest interest in religious issues and especially Salafism’. Within this category, the targeters prioritise those known to have suffered at the hands of what a source called ‘extremist Hanafi students’, or whose family members were caught up in the Taliban’s repression of IS activity. Typically, in a class of 40 to 50 students, there will be one to two worth targeting. Once a targeted student is identified, the targeting structure tries to get their mobile number. Then, the ‘media and culture’ section takes over. The job of the media and culture team, who are based outside the university, even as far away as Europe, is to send to prospective recruits videos of ‘cruelties, killing, torturing and arresting of Salafi scholars, common Salafis, women and children by Taliban’, messages about Salafism, and videos and news about the Taliban negotiating with the Americans. Before the regime change of 2021, the propaganda material had been about ‘foreigners bombing Muslims’ and the ‘torturing and arresting of Muslim men, women and children by Americans’. If there is a negative reaction, the ‘invitee’ is immediately cut off from messaging. If the response is positive, WhatsApp and other social media apps start to be used. The media and culture team also adds targeted students to various IS-K Telegram accounts, some of which advertise the activities of IS-K, while others propagate negative propaganda against the Taliban.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next stage, after the ground has been prepared by exposure to ‘media and culture’ work, sees the ‘chatting and inviting’ team take over, opening a one-on-one chat room on Telegram or WhatsApp and tasking its cadres to befriend specific individuals. These one-on-one chats focus on the situation of Salafis in Afghanistan, on the ‘cruelties’ of the Taliban against Salafis, on harassment suffered at the hands of Hanafi students and Taliban on campus, on the ‘jihad’ and the activities and aims of IS-K, and on IS’s ‘Caliphate’, as well as many other issues. During this phase, the recruiter regularly visits the target both on the university campus and outside it, to learn more about their mindset and views, build up trust and develop a friendship. Prospective recruits are directly fed or directed towards hundreds of speeches and lectures by well-known Salafi preachers, for example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sheikh Abu Obaidullah Mutawakil, a member of the Sharia faculty at Kabul University, who was detained under the Islamic Republic for acting as an IS-K recruiter, and abducted and assassinated after the Taliban takeover, in September 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mubashir Muslimyar, also a member of the Sharia faculty at Kabul, assassinated in Kabul in February 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marouf Rasikh, a third member of the Sharia faculty at Kabul, who was detained and released under the Islamic Republic, only to be assassinated in February 2021 in Kabul.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Abdul Zahir Da’ee, another member of the Sharia faculty, Kabul, and the only one of this group still alive and active. He was detained under the Islamic Republic.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the targeted student is familiar with such preachers’ thinking, they are invited by the recruiter to convert to Salafism or, if already Salafi, to adopt a stricter attitude. If this works out well, the target is invited to join openly pro-IS-K private chats on Telegram. Some recruits are ready at this stage to volunteer for IS-K, while others might need more work. In the latter case, targets’ reactions to the private IS-K channels are observed over a period of several days. If the reaction is positive, the targeted individual is invited to join the jihad against the Taliban and anyone else who is opposed to Salafism and the Caliphate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before being invited to join IS-K, prospective recruits are invited to embrace Salafism or, if they are already Salafis, to start practising it more strictly. After a while, the targeted students are invited to join the jihad against the Taliban and anybody who is against Salafism and the Caliphate. If the invitation is accepted, the invitee is offered a face-to-face meeting. This is when the ‘faceto-face’ team takes over. Soon afterwards, this team offers training to the prospective recruit in one of the IS-K camps in preparation for fully joining as a member. The entire process typically takes up to three months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of those who reach the stage of being fed IS-K propaganda agree to join, although not all. Because up to this point potential recruits have only been contacted via social media, they present only a limited risk to IS-K: all they can do is alert the authorities that something is going on, but they cannot compromise any individuals. Most university recruits are not interested in becoming fighters, even if they do join. For this reason, they are often offered roles such as being a support element in a terrorist cell, social media activist, preacher/indoctrinator, working in logistics, or looking after safe houses, among other things. Some do become terrorist cell leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;taliban-counterterrorism&quot;&gt;TALIBAN COUNTERTERRORISM&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;practice-diverges-from-policy-and-principles&quot;&gt;PRACTICE DIVERGES FROM POLICY AND PRINCIPLES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public universities closed immediately after the Taliban took Kabul in August 2021. The Taliban declared that they wanted to determine how to gender-segregate campuses before reopening them. Simultaneously, the Taliban restricted discourse on politics, human rights and Islam. When the universities reopened in February 2022, the Taliban knew they were going to face trouble on the campuses, because as a movement they always had little appeal among university students and were perceived as hostile to secular education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their approach to the IS-K presence on university campuses should be viewed within the context of the Emirate’s wider approach to counterterrorism. The Taliban do not appear to have formulated any specific or explicit counterterrorism policy. The previous government, the Islamic Republic, did formulate policies, but it did not implement them systematically. Those policies were based on ‘Western’ counterterrorism concepts, of which respect for the rule of law and human rights were, in theory, essential elements – notwithstanding the fact that, in practice, Afghan security forces and Western actors might often disregard such elements. Indeed, the security forces of the Islamic Republic by and large maintained a high degree of scepticism about these policies. The following summary of their critique derives from a series of interviews with Afghan enforcement officials, carried out in 2015–21, during the years of the Islamic Republic:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rule of law slows the counterterror effort and wastes precious time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rule of law, with the high standards of evidence required, makes it difficult to convict.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In terror emergencies, qualified relevant personnel, such as adequately trained police officers, are scarce and it is very hard to gather sufficient evidence for a conviction, the more so in Afghanistan, where qualified personnel were scarce even before the insurgency began.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Torture and physical pressure deliver quick results during interrogation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Highly motivated terrorists are not going to be deterred by the threat of ordinary custodial sentences and are unlikely to be convinced to collaborate without extreme forms of pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Media freedom is not useful when tackling terrorism, as it advertises the achievements of the terrorists while embarrassing the authorities with the exposure of their failures and/or ruthless methods.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Civilian supporters are a key asset of insurgents and terrorists and must be targeted aggressively as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussed below, the Taliban, while not deliberately intending to imitate the former regime’s critics of Western counterterrorism, in many cases shared these attitudes to varying degrees and incorporated them (either individually or as an organisation) into their own practice once they rose to power, despite their commitment to operate under the Sharia and therefore under a type of rule of law. The adoption of counterterrorism practices based on the above assumptions could be a consequence of having been on the receiving end of such practices, of a shared cultural understanding of what effective counterterrorism should be or of any number of other reasons. Determining the cultural and political sources of the Taliban’s approach to counterterrorism is beyond the scope of this paper. What is important to note here is the presence of specific attitudes, operating at either individual or organisational levels, that – as in the time of the Islamic Republic – influenced the counterterrorism effort of the Taliban’s Emirate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerning the rule of law (points 1, 2 and 3 above), while the Taliban are in principle committed to introducing their own version of the rule of law, based on Sharia, they have often been wary of applying the protection afforded by the religious texts to rebels, especially IS-K ones. Whether as a result of a deliberate policy or uncontrolled rhetoric freely flourishing in Talibancontrolled media, the term ‘Kharijites’ (khawarij), implying an extreme and even heretical approach, has been in regular use when referring to IS-K. This disparaging term has often been used by governments of countries affected by Islamist insurgencies to justify reliance on extreme measures against seditious elements, who are essentially treated as apostates and therefore worthy of indiscriminate repression. Certainly, the use of such a term can only encourage Taliban practitioners of counterterrorism to bypass whatever Sharia-based rule-of-law constraints may be there in principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taliban have, in fact, been inconsistent in the way they deal with IS-K militants, sometimes treating them and suspected supporters as ‘Kharijites’ and sometimes using more standard sanctions against them, even on some occasions attempting to use negotiations and political agreements to draw community elders away from IS-K and undermine it. As far as university campuses go, the treatment of Mutawakil is a good example of arbitrary treatment: as noted above, he was first abducted and then arbitrarily executed, reportedly by the Taliban, in September 2021. The Taliban denied responsibility but were widely seen as responsible by the media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of torture and physical pressure by the Taliban (points 4 and 5 above) have been noted in a number of reports from international organisations. It was also confirmed as an issue in interviews for this research. An IS-K member noted that he joined following a direct clash with one of his teachers, who was strongly hostile to his Salafist views. He was then detained by the Taliban for two days and tortured and threatened. He was released after promising to change his ideology and then suffered harassment by Hanafi students. When IS-K approached him, he was ripe for recruitment and became an IS-K recruiter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of the Taliban adopting an inconsistent approach is their handling of media reporting (point 6 above). Despite verbally committing to ‘media freedom’ from the start of its second Emirate, the Taliban have been sporadically banning reporting of violent incidents and counterterrorism activities in the belief that it would play into the hands of IS-K if its actions (and the subsequent repressive measures) received media exposure. This also applied to reporting detentions of suspects on the campuses. The Taliban have not been keen to advertise the extent of their repression there. A dozen students and staff on different campuses (out of 15 who were contacted) had the feeling that the Taliban were withholding information regarding arrests of students or staff. At other times, however, the Taliban have used their media apparatus to describe IS-K as ‘Kharijites’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Related to point 7 above – and again seemingly in breach of Sharia – is the Taliban’s approach towards radical groups that in the West might be described as ‘non-violent extremists’ and that the Taliban describe as ‘Salafileaning’ or ‘pro-Caliphate’. Groups such as HuT, Jami’at Eslah and Najm were banned early on by the Taliban and some alleged HuT members were even detained. Although these groups do not support IS-K or IS Central, the Taliban appear concerned that HuT, for example, advocates the advent of the Caliphate worldwide, and is an international organisation. In the words of a member of the GDI: ‘They advocate the Caliphate in the entire world but we want Sharia only for Afghanistan and we don’t want to interfere in the internal issues of other countries’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That the Taliban’s jihad is a national one is now a key claim of the Emirate’s foreign policy effort, although the Taliban continue to host foreign jihadist groups such as the Pakistani TTP (Tehrik Taliban Pakistan, or Movement of the Pakistani Taliban), Al-Qa’ida and others. Jami’at Eslah has also been viewed with suspicion because of its Salafi influences, which make its ideology ‘closer to Daesh’ (or IS-K). Especially in Badakhshan University (Faizabad), there is a belief that HuT – reportedly quite popular there – facilitates, directly or indirectly, recruitment into IS-K. However, one student at the private Al-Biruni University (in Gulbahar) noted that HuT continued to operate freely there, despite Taliban control, and that the group did not hide its online recruitment activities. He also noted that online activism by HuT was undertaken secretly before the Taliban takeover, but then began to be conducted more openly. A Taliban security source disputed this, saying that HuT and Jami’at Eslah had been active at Al-Biruni, but that neither was still able to operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, in its online propaganda, HuT appears to have adopted a line of ‘constructive criticism’ of the Emirate, and certainly does not endorse violent opposition to it.56 Overall, the Taliban’s approach seems to have varied from location to location, often involving attempts to distinguish in practice between members of non-violent extremist groups who establish links to IS-K, and those who do not, even if the standards of proof for charging and detaining individuals are never clear. At the end of November 2022, the Taliban reiterated their ban on organisations suspected of Salafi sympathies or of advocating the Caliphate, suggesting an awareness that the ban was being only loosely enforced at the grassroots level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;impact-mixed-results&quot;&gt;IMPACT: MIXED RESULTS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of stopping IS-K recruitment on campuses, the Taliban have faced a serious challenge, strapped as they are for resources, both human and financial. Especially in the early days of the second Emirate, the Taliban lacked suitably trained security and intelligence personnel. In the only publicly available (as of April 2023) breakdown of the Emirate’s budget, released in January 2022, expenditure on security appears at around 40% of the total budget, which would mean up to $800 million per year in 2022. Around 16% of the Emirate’s total budget (about $320 million as of 2022) went specifically to the GDI. This compares unfavourably with the $2.15 billion available to the Islamic Republic in 2021 for defence and public order and safety (54% of the operating budget), on top of billions of US money being pumped directly into the Afghan security forces. While the Taliban have so far confronted a much less threatening situation than the Islamic Republic did in its later years, the salary burden of civil servants alone, inherited from the Islamic Republic, amounted in 2021 to over $170 million per month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judging by the interviews for this paper, it would appear that, by and large, they have succeeded in turning the campuses into significantly less permissive environments for IS-K to operate in, thanks to a mix of intensified intelligence operations targeting what they call Kharijites and takfiri (‘excommunicators’) on campus, strict control over the campus environment, and effective Taliban deterrence against any form of dissent. Students and staff are investigated for even the most indirect links to IS-K or any other group opposed to the Taliban. Harsh punishment for those suspected of supporting opposition groups also acts as an additional deterrent. Although around a quarter of the 20 individuals contacted (students, university staff, Taliban security officers) believed that recruitment by extremist groups had not halted since the Taliban takeover, the group mentioned most often as being active was HuT, not IS-K. Evidence of ongoing IS-K presence on campuses is scant, in contrast to what was happening before August 2021, when extremist groups were able to spread propaganda in the dormitories. As noted earlier, Kabul University’s dormitories had been identified as a previous hotspot for IS-K activity. In 2021, Taliban security sources said that IS-K activities were taking place on the Kabul campus for some time after the regime change in August 2021, but that, following arrests, these activities stopped. However, some evidence suggests that this was a premature assessment. A year later, one Taliban security source confirmed that arrests of students for IS-K links in university dormitories had occurred in the previous six months. The GDI provided Taliban security officials with a list of students active in takfiri propaganda, who were then arrested. Kabul University students linked to IS-K who came from Logar and Nangarhar provinces were also arrested when they returned to their home provinces, following cross-province coordination between Taliban and GDI officials. This source optimistically stated that no violent extremist activity was ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the optimism of some Taliban officials, others were more worried. This was particularly so in relation to the Faizabad campus of Badakhshan University. Some research contacts, including one in the Taliban’s campus security, believed that recruitment efforts were still going on in Faizabad. Taliban sources have often been evasive about details of arrests, but they confirmed that there had been several. On the Badakhshan University campus, a Taliban source claimed that professors who were inclined toward Salafism and affiliated with IS-K and HuT had been arrested, and that further arrests were likely. He also confirmed detentions of students on the grounds of links to HuT and IS-K. Other Taliban security sources, in Gulbahar and Nangarhar, confirmed arrests on both campuses, but did not provide details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many cases, students or staff have been directly aware of arrests taking place, especially on the Faizabad campus, where all sources knew of regular arrests being made, even if the reasons were not always clear. One student at Kabul University was aware of one arrest of a student on allegations of links to IS-K. At Nangarhar University, in the recent past there have been numerous disappearances of students accused of having links with IS-K.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extent of Taliban success in stifling online IS-K activism is much more questionable. This paper does not draw on direct investigation of IS-K online activities, but rather on interviews and contacts, so any assessment of these activities would be on shaky ground. Moreover, students were unsure about the extent of online activism. One student, for example, claimed that while social networks were a recruitment site for extremist groups, such groups had only a minimal online presence. University staff members offered contrasting views. One stated that the social media recruitment activities of violent extremist groups had increased since the Taliban takeover, but did not give further details or evidence to support these claims. Another, in Badakhshan University, held the opposite view, stating that the Taliban takeover had led to an unprecedented decrease in use of social media by IS-K. Probably the most reliable view is that of one Taliban security officer, who acknowledged that the Taliban were monitoring groups online, and that activism was ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The predominant view was that IS-K online activities have become somewhat riskier but are continuing. Revealingly, IS-K has been warning its followers through its social media accounts of Taliban infiltration efforts, exploiting IS-K recruitment efforts on social media. Another risk factor is that the Taliban regularly search mobile phones and monitor students’ social media accounts on campus. According to one student in Parwan, students were too afraid to carry their phones on campus; any content that could be traced to Taliban opponents (even a single photograph) was likely to result in arrest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IS-K sources claim that, despite the Taliban’s measures, they have still been able to recruit on campuses. Assessments offered by IS-K sources could be questionable, of course, but when cross-checked with each other’s accounts and viewed in the overall context, these accounts do not offer a picture of overwhelming success and seem, therefore, rather plausible. IS-K appears to have coped comparatively well on the Nangarhar University campus. An IS-K source claims that from March to November 2022 the organisation was able to recruit more than 30 students at Nangarhar, most of whom ended up in combat units, with several also joining as preachers and indoctrinators and being dispatched to various locations. In Kabul, by contrast, recruitment into IS-K slowed greatly following the Taliban’s takeover, largely because the Taliban have created an especially thick network of spies and informers there. One cell was reportedly identified by the Taliban but managed to flee before its members were detained. Overall, therefore, considering the distribution of Salafism around Afghanistan (largely confined to the east and northeast) and that Nangarhar University is one of the largest recruitment grounds for IS-K, the yearly recruitment output of IS-K on the campuses could be estimated at not much more than 100 people. These recruits will, however, all be valuable cadres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While recruitment is still going on, the ease with which IS-K is able to attract members should not be exaggerated. One recruiter in Kabul said that of five potential recruits that he chose for targeting and passed on to the followup teams, one joined and four refused; a sixth was being processed as of November 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;is-k-countermeasures-and-prospects&quot;&gt;IS-K COUNTERMEASURES AND PROSPECTS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;adaptation&quot;&gt;ADAPTATION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IS-K has not been idly watching while the Taliban tries to shut down its recruitment networks on Afghanistan’s university campuses. Indeed, the majority of interviewees assumed that IS-K recruitment activities were ongoing on social media, but hidden in private channels, even if most of them claimed not to know how recruitment on social media worked. A Taliban security officer explained that while the Taliban can infiltrate Facebook groups, and the use of Facebook by IS-K has decreased, IS-K has switched to using Telegram, Instagram, WhatsApp and Signal. Growing reliance on private social media channels has thus been an important form of adaptation. A staff member at Parwan University agreed that IS-K does not operate directly through social media networks, because of Taliban scrutiny. He concurred that private channels are used to invite potential recruits, giving the examples of WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. Islamic materials, including innocuous ones such as hadiths (the Prophet’s sayings), are published on these private channels to attract pious students, who are then shown more political material. A student at Parwan University noted that students are added to WhatsApp groups that share a mix of generic religious material and more specific Salafi propaganda, whether they like it or not. These groups are reportedly run anonymously. Another student, in Kabul, claimed that he knew that ‘violent extremist groups’ published material on social media, but since these groups were invite-only and he was not a member, he could not give more information. These accounts corroborate the data that emerged from interviews, discussed above, regarding IS-K activities on Afghanistan’s campuses after the Taliban takeover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another form of adaptation by IS-K has been to move its social media activities abroad, especially to Europe, where there is a large Afghan diaspora. A Taliban security official admitted that even Facebook accounts promoting the downfall of the Emirate are still operated, but by IS-K members based abroad. Following engagement with such outputs, potential recruits could then be passed on to anonymous WhatsApp and Telegram channels, where further vetting takes place before formal recruitment occurs. The Taliban cannot, of course, do much against IS-K propagandists based abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from investing more in reshaped online activities, IS-K might well be still adjusting to the Taliban’s presence on campus. At the time of making these enquiries, only 10 months had passed since the Taliban reopened the campuses, and IS-K may be assessing the new landscape and/or waiting for the Taliban to relax their scrutiny before restarting recruitment activities. To bypass Taliban focus, recruiters could seek to intensify recruitment in Salafileaning mosques that students frequent, for example. The Taliban appear to think the same, and such mosques have time and again been subject to severe restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-promising-environment&quot;&gt;A PROMISING ENVIRONMENT&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;University campuses could again become a favourable environment for IS-K recruitment in the longer term, due to widespread student discontent on campus, anti-Taliban sentiment, and a broad sense of despondency and lack of hope for the future. Judging from 15 interviews with university students and teaching staff on four different Afghan campuses (Kabul, Jalalabad, Gulbahar and Faizabad), students are struggling to adapt to new Taliban rules on campus, such as gender segregation and the need to adhere to Taliban dress codes. The threat of Taliban violence for those not abiding by the new rules and the precedent of the Taliban targeting offenders’ families appear to be a source of distress for many students. Many students also feel patronised by the Taliban’s treatment, with research respondents commenting that they were already committed to Islam before the Taliban takeover and did not appreciate being forced to follow the Taliban’s interpretation of the religion. Students claim that they have been forced to repeat prayers because the Taliban does not believe that they have already prayed; that they have been beaten for falling asleep following prayers during Ramadan; that they are forced to listen to preaching by Taliban-affiliated mullahs after prayer time; and that men are forced to wear traditional Afghan clothing to campus, while women were forced to wear black niqabs (before the ban on women in higher education was imposed). Although frustration deriving from these issues is not likely to drive students towards IS-K per se, it is likely to reduce cooperation with the Taliban authorities among students, and therefore make counterterrorism measures harder to implement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost all students cited pessimism regarding the job market postgraduation. Several students expressed a desire to emigrate from Afghanistan immediately following graduation, because of doubts about their ability to find work in the country. A staff member at a private university in Gulbahar claimed that up to 90% of students in private universities had dropped out due to feelings of despondency about the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five different university staff members agreed that reductions in teachers’ salaries, increased teaching hours and the departure of large numbers of qualified teachers from Afghanistan were affecting the quality of education. University teachers were reportedly unmotivated and overworked, in particular as a result of the increased teaching hours necessitated by gender segregation (before the ban on women in universities came into place). Students also noted a decline in teaching quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the vast majority of students faced with an uncertain future in Afghanistan will seek to emigrate, a minority of more Salafi-oriented students could become susceptible to IS-K recruitment. Students inclined to Salafism are likely to have taken specific offence at some of the Taliban’s practices on campus for religious reasons, as Salafism runs contrary to several of these, such as the Taliban-mandated dress code for men and women. The Salafis have their own interpretation of Sharia, and what might look like minor differences to outsiders would have major implications for those involved. With anti-Salafi practices widespread on campuses, Taliban attempts to dominate the religious discourse in universities, and the targeting of Salafi scholars and madrasas, strong feelings among Salafi students are likely to be still making them susceptible to IS recruitment. One Taliban security source hinted that for a period after the regime change, Salafis had initially been keen to work with the Taliban, after the Taliban had targeted some of their ulema, but he acknowledged that anti-Taliban sentiment had significantly increased on Badakhshan University campus since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper examined the understudied IS-K presence on Afghanistan’s university campuses and the counterterrorism effort that the Taliban regime has mounted against it. It set out to assess the performance of the Taliban in one case study of counterterrorism – against IS-K activities on the campuses – as well as the ways in which IS-K sought to adapt. The research team gathered evidence of a sophisticated IS-K approach to recruitment on Afghanistan’s university campuses, combining face-to-face and remote techniques. It is also clear that IS-K’s recruitment is aimed at a relatively small niche: largely Salafi and Salafi-leaning students. As such, the approach can yield only a limited number of recruits, certainly not exceeding the low hundreds annually. Nonetheless, these are high-quality recruits, on which the highly ideological and disciplined IS-K must rely to sustain its operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taliban seem indeed to have paid considerable attention to the problem. The days of the Islamic Republic’s half-hearted efforts to deal with IS-K are certainly gone. By denying to IS-K activists the space they once had, the Taliban have constrained IS-K’s ability to recruit. However, the underlying conditions favouring IS-K recruitment persist. These are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Harassment of Salafi students by some of their Hanafi colleagues, which reinforces resentment against the dominant Hanafi school.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Heavy-handed treatment of suspects by Taliban police and intelligence, which pushes some towards joining IS-K to seek revenge.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Widespread student frustration over conditions and lack of prospects.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Increasing Taliban pressure on non-violent extremist groups that have roots among students, such as HuT, Jami’at Eslah and others, which might drive some of their members towards IS-K.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taliban’s approach to counterterrorism on university campuses has, in other words, been focused on repression, with seemingly little, if any, effort towards prevention. The ability of the Taliban to reduce IS-K activities using heavy-handed measures runs the risk of delivering both short-term positive results and long-term counterproductive ones, not least because the Taliban struggle to restrain the behaviour of their sympathisers and indeed anyone holding anti-Salafi views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lack of a stable prevention policy means that the IS-K’s pool of potential recruits is likely not shrinking, assuming that drivers of recruitment, such as student frustration and Hanafi–Salafi friction, remain constant. Taliban repression might have reduced IS-K’s ability to tap this pool, but this could well be only temporary, especially as IS-K adapts and refines its recruitment techniques. Indeed, even over the relatively short time elapsed since regime change in Kabul (one year and five months at the time of writing), there were already signs that IS-K was adapting by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Relying more on private social media channels.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moving more of its social media activists abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Warning its members and sympathisers about the risk of Taliban infiltrators and provocateurs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The high level of tension between Hanafi and Salafi on the campuses makes it difficult for the Taliban and Salafi elders to trust each other. Hence, it does seem clear that future prevention policies will be hard to develop and implement. Regardless, without some form of preventive measures, the Taliban might be forcing upon themselves a very long campaign against IS-K.&lt;/p&gt;

In sketching the outline of a U.S. grand strategy in Latin America and the Caribbean, this report provides a framework within which to answer critical questions that remain unanswered in U.S. policymaking circles: which level of Chinese engagement the United States should permit versus what it should seek to curtail, as well as the necessarily circumscribed areas where U.S. competition should be resource-backed, well thought out, and creatively messaged. The report offers three categories for thinking through the terms of engagement with China in Latin America and the Caribbean: insulation, curtailment, and competition.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standard documents that would normally serve as reference points for the terms of engagement—the National Security Strategy and the National Defense Strategy—contain scant mention of LAC. While the Biden administration’s National Security Strategy hits strong notes on “great power competition” with China and a global competition between democracy and autocracy, LAC occupies only two pages of reflection. Further, the section on LAC mentions China only once, in conjunction with Russia and Iran as examples of dangerous extra-hemispheric actors. The National Defense Strategy, meanwhile, contains a mere paragraph about LAC’s important contribution to a stable, peaceful, and prosperous United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet it is critically important for the United States to develop a policy on the terms of engagement with China in LAC that would begin to approximate a grand strategy. This policy should aim to compete with China across multiple domains, in a resource-backed, whole-of-government manner that leverages the strengths of the United States’ democratic partners and allies. However, the policy must strike the right balance and avoid overreach—which, in this case, would be asking LAC partners and allies to forgo the occasional benefits of trade and investment with China. One well-known foreign policy analyst summed up this balance well: “Trying to do it all, everywhere, will produce exhaustion and undermine U.S. capacity to address what matters most . . . If it wants to succeed, the United States is going to have to pick its battles carefully.” This is even truer in LAC, a region that is perennially undervalued and under-resourced by the U.S. government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;levers-of-coercion&quot;&gt;Levers of Coercion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China continues to build upon a formidable set of levers that it can use to coerce countries that challenge it or that pursue policies seen as undermining its core interests. China has become the top trading partner for many countries in South America and the second-largest trading partner for nearly all of LAC. The Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) signature foreign policy program, its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), invests in large infrastructure projects in 21 of LAC’s 34 countries, including sensitive infrastructure such as nuclear power and space stations. More recently, China has commenced a push for its Global Security Initiative. And China has become a key provider of financing to many countries in LAC—to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars—through its state-backed policy banks and its commercial banks. This is to say nothing of China’s growing soft power in LAC through a proliferating number of Confucius Institutes, policymaker and military-to-military exchanges, a presence in multilateral forums such as the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), and the International Liaison Department’s close working relationship with hundreds of political parties in LAC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As China continues to increase its economic ties with countries around the world, it threatens to overtake the United States’ economic partnerships with many countries in LAC. Academic studies show that China has strengthened its ties with countries in LAC where U.S. engagement was weakest; in other words, China fills important vacuums when the United States abdicates regional leadership. Perhaps even more concerning, however, is the idea posited by the political economist Albert Hirschman that increased trade between countries, and the eventual growth of trade dependence between states, tends to forge bonds that can contribute to foreign policy convergence. China-LAC convergence on critical issues would severely hinder the United States and effectively neutralize LAC as a strategic asset in broader “great power competition” with China. Increased trade with China engenders domestic constituencies and lobby groups that allow the People’s Republic of China (PRC) further avenues of domestic policy influence. A recent report by the International Republican Institute found that the presence of these groups can lead to a “weakening of democratic institutions, a reduced inclination to support democratic norms globally, and/or increased support for the PRC’s deeply authoritarian model of governance and global ambitions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China-LAC convergence on critical issues would severely hinder the United States and effectively neutralize LAC as a strategic asset in broader “great power competition” with China.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In China’s case, even as it retains a robust toolkit for amassing influence, trade remains the most important and enduring way for it to influence other countries’ politics. Often, trade is the entry point or gateway for Chinese influence. As China’s economy has grown and other countries have become dependent on it, the CCP has shown a propensity to leverage political and economic interdependence in ruthless and capricious ways. From Norwegian salmon to South Korean tourism and from Australian barley, coal, and wine to Lithuanian furniture, over the last decade hundreds of examples of Chinese coercion abound, sometimes over even the slightest annoyances to the CCP. The political scientists Henry Farrell and Abraham Newman observe that China, as a result of the last two decades of globalization and global governance mechanisms, has “weaponized interdependence.” As one author recently put it, “Beijing’s long-term objective is to force governments and companies to anticipate, respect, and defer to Chinese interests in all future actions.” One could be forgiven for thinking the author was offering a definition of the word “fealty” rather than describing China’s emerging geopolitical strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although China’s predatory behavior predates the more recent examples, Chinese president Xi Jinping provided a theoretical contribution to the CCP’s policy of economic coercion in a set of speeches beginning in 2020, in which he speaks of the “powerful gravitational field” exercised by China’s market behemoth. A series of textbooks for the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) focused on Xi’s ideology, uncovered by Ian Easton, contains further statements of political coercion as official CCP policy: “We must gain a grip on foreign government leaders and their business elites by encouraging our companies to invest in their local economies.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Through massive subsidies, unfair market access, forced technology transfer, and large state-owned enterprises, China aims to reshape much of the global economy, reorient supply chains through China, and rewire much of the world’s commerce in Beijing’s favor.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although overtaking the United States in total economic size remains at least a nominal policy priority, the CCP grasps that minimizing dependence on other countries, while maximizing other countries’ dependence on China, provides it with the most powerful set of short- to medium-term coercive levers. Indeed, one could read China’s recent moves as an acknowledgement that it will not achieve economic supremacy over the United States any time soon, transitioning instead to become a producer of high-value goods for its adversaries and thus maintain the ability to “wield its very large economy as a strategic weapon.” Studies have shown that the most effective way to weaponize economic interdependence is to maintain a dominant position in a hierarchical network structure—akin to what China aims to create with its privileged companies, which enjoy massive state subsidies and protection from competition by foreign firms. Short of constructing an economy capable of driving innovation in the twenty-first century, Xi’s China can still maintain important tools of coercion over developed and developing countries alike. In LAC, China has focused on industries it calls “new infrastructure,” which includes sensitive areas such as 5G, electricity provision, high-speed rail infrastructure, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through massive subsidies, unfair market access, forced technology transfer, and large state-owned enterprises, China aims to reshape much of the global economy, reorient supply chains through China, and rewire much of the world’s commerce in Beijing’s favor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The LAC region is incredibly exposed to Chinese political and economic coercion, and China’s willingness to use its levers of influence has only increased in recent years. Recent examples of coercion encompass pursuing political influence, championing economic interests, reducing Taiwan’s diplomatic allies, and following hard security interests. Even LAC’s largest economies are not immune. For instance, after initial signs that the Bolsonaro administration in Brazil would shut Huawei out of the auction for its 5G spectrum, China threatened to halt Covid-19 vaccinations to Brazil—just as the country was buckling under the weight of a severe pandemic wave. Huawei will now build part of Brazil’s 5G infrastructure. In Paraguay, the last country in South America to recognize Taiwan, China demanded it drop its recognition of Taiwan before it could buy Covid-19 vaccines. In Ecuador, nearly $20 billion in debt taken out by autocratic president Rafael Correa has hamstrung the government for years. Although China recently renegotiated two deals after it came under significant pressure to do so, the damage was already done. For years, Ecuador’s repayment of its unsustainable debt burden to China remained tethered to the performance of its oil industry, and in particular, its state-owned oil company. A congressional committee found that the inability to sell Ecuador’s oil on the spot market had cost the country about $5 billion, while recently renegotiated debt deals permitting more oil to be sold on the spot market would net the country only an additional $28 million in revenues. Ecuador’s debts to China also largely froze the country’s development goals for years as it was forced to double down on commodities production and export. Worse yet, Ecuador was forced to drill for oil in sensitive biozones in the Amazon—areas in which it had previously promised not to drill, in an international effort to preserve indigenous territories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Argentina, indebtedness and Chinese influence in the government of then-president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner paved the way for the Espacio Lejano space station in Neuquén Province, the first Chinese deep space station built outside of China. The center is run by the China Satellite Launch and Tracking Control General, a sub-entity to the PLA, while Argentina has no oversight whatsoever over the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from these highly specific examples of targeted political and economic coercion, there are more general concerns about LAC’s unsustainable indebtedness to China. For instance, according to the IDB, 50 percent of total government-to-government debt is in China’s hands. LAC is also willing to accept shoddily constructed or potential dual-use infrastructure projects through the BRI. So far, China has mostly resisted attempts to force it to write down debt in the developing world, arguing that it, too, is a developing country. Critically, a 2021 report by Aid Data shows that, in addition to the hundreds of billions in publicly known debt, the developing world has nearly $400 billion in “hidden debt” to China—knowledge of debt levels that was not publicly available previously because it did not appear on government balance sheets. Much of this debt is held by LAC countries. In general, Aid Data finds that “for every dollar of aid to low-income and middle-income countries, China has provided $9 of debt. The opposite is true of the US: For every dollar of debt that it provides to low-income and middle-income countries, it provides at least $9 of aid.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a 2021 hearing of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, China’s construction of potential “dual-use” infrastructure through the BRI was a major topic of concern. The PRC counts a total of approximately 40 port-building or upgrading projects in LAC, almost all of them handled by Chinese state-owned enterprises and with some situated in countries geographically proximate to the United States. Further, the PRC has over 150 planned transportation infrastructure projects in the Western Hemisphere that contain some type of port or logistics hub. Despite the purported pacific nature of these facility upgrades, China has been credibly accused in the past—in the United Arab Emirates and Equatorial Guinea—of surreptitiously building military applications into port facilities, later exploited by the PLA. To punctuate the security concern, a recent report by Maritime Executive concludes: “It turns out that one-third of ports in which China made economic investments have hosted and also resupplied military vessels of the People’s Liberation Army Navy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is easy to see how China’s drive for economic and political leverage in pursuit of its wide-ranging interests will have an impact on LAC’s unconsolidated democracies, threaten its democratic traditions, and contribute to a breakdown in rule of law and greater corruption. Whether willful or indirect, China’s increasing engagement has coincided with an uptick in democratic backsliding and a rise in authoritarian governance throughout the LAC region. Any U.S. strategy for the terms of engagement in LAC needs to account for how China’s pursuit of its geopolitical interests may be distorting LAC’s democratic development. The good news is that there are sound strategies to blunt the effects of China’s approach to weaponized interdependence and to “deny, deflect, and deter” its predatory economic policies in a region such as LAC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strategic-contours-past-and-present&quot;&gt;Strategic Contours, Past and Present&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In previous eras, the United States pursued a grand strategy centered on strategic denial against rival powers in LAC. As part of this strategy, the United States sought to prevent powerful rivals from establishing a strategic foothold in the region that might impact the United States’ influence and security. Due to the perceived absence of significant extra-hemispheric actors in the region after the Cold War, for several decades the United States neglected LAC and focused its major foreign policy efforts on other regions. Strategic denial as a grand strategy fell out of vogue. However, China’s decade and a half of deep engagement has put the region back on the radar, even as the United States continues to lack broad strategic guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In thinking through the broad contours of a twenty-first century grand strategy for great power competition in LAC, the United States should seek to shape the environment such that it constrains China’s negative behavior—mostly its appetite for political and economic coercion—and encourages constructive activities that could benefit LAC. By no means should the United States seek to interrupt or interfere in every aspect of China’s multifaceted engagement with LAC. Such a strategy is both unrealistic and likely to generate resentment and blowback from U.S. partners in the region. With respect to some aspects of China’s engagement that have become routine and even welcome from the regional perspective, the United States cannot reasonably attempt to block such involvement without severely damaging its relationships with partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should not stand by idly, either. On the contrary, the United States should pursue an active, muscular, three-pronged grand strategy in LAC focused around three major principles: insulation, curtailment, and competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The United States should pursue an active, muscular, three-pronged grand strategy in LAC focused around three major principles: insulation, curtailment, and competition.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insulation:&lt;/strong&gt; Insulation strategies will be the most commonly employed. The United States should work to help fortify and insulate countries in LAC from the most adverse impacts of China’s continued engagement and ensure that democracy remains the preferred political system in the region. The United States will not prevail in a dollar-for-dollar competition with China on development projects in LAC. As one scholar rightly points out, there is a “self-defeating logic” to transactional diplomacy versus China in LAC. The United States also lacks—for good reason—China’s ability to direct capital from its private sector to mobilize in service of state and party goals. Indeed, China’s mechanisms of party control over the private sector provide strong reason to believe this is an inefficient use of capital. These realities mean that China will, of course, continue to play an outsized role as a partner in LAC’s development strategies and economic growth for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, insulation implies helping LAC countries operate within a framework of transparency, rule of law, and equal opportunity that will ensure that the region remains true to its democratic traditions and obligations under the Inter-American Democratic Charter. Proper insulation strategies will take into account the region’s own institutional weaknesses and corruption and help LAC fortify institutions and get the most out of its engagement with China, all while protecting it from some of the most corrosive effects of that engagement. In short, insulation strategies aim to blunt elements of the large power asymmetry between LAC countries and China, permitting China fewer opportunities to exploit that asymmetry to its benefit and ensuring a more level playing field and greater policy autonomy for LAC countries. Insulation strategies should also protect LAC democracies from turns toward populist governments that invite further involvement by China in problematic ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned already, China is assiduously pursuing advantages in international affairs that will furnish the opportunity to coerce countries economically and politically. Insulation strategies should seek to deter Beijing by puncturing its confidence that pursuing coercion will yield positive results against the United States and LAC countries. Maintaining a favorable balance of dependence and a strong ability and desire to resist coercion in a wide range of areas may be the decisive factor in any strategy aimed at competing against China in LAC. After all, Vladimir Putin’s devastating invasion of Ukraine hinged significantly on his (spurious) belief that Russia had attained enough European dependence on its energy exports that the European Union would not come to Kyiv’s aid. Avoiding similar calculations by Xi’s China will be critical to effective deterrence and grand strategy in all regions of the world, LAC included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Curtailment:&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to helping countries strengthen internal mechanisms and compete on a level playing field, it is also important to curtail certain aspects of China’s engagement that impact democratic traditions and threaten policy autonomy in LAC, such as the increasing involvement of untrusted vendors in the information and communications technology (ICT) sector. Curtailment involves clearly messaging U.S. redlines and holding firm on these redlines. Because of its potential to ruffle U.S. relationships in LAC, curtailment should be selective and pursued only when China’s engagement truly threatens (1) LAC’s policy autonomy, (2) LAC’s democratic traditions, or (3) key U.S. interests in the region. There should be a set of extremely high standards for asking U.S. partners and allies in LAC to bear the costs of forgoing a relationship with China in a particular area. An unnecessarily expansive pursuit of curtailment could not only result in relationship friction but also provide fodder to China’s (debilitating) argument that the United States is interested in LAC only because of China’s presence. Ideally, curtailment strategies would be paired with competition strategies, thus marshaling resources to ensure that a U.S. alternative is made available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Competition:&lt;/strong&gt; Complementary to efforts insulating the region from adverse impacts of China’s engagement and curtailing certain types of engagement, the United States will also need to develop a resource-backed strategy to ensure that viable democratic alternatives are on the table in areas where the United States can effectively compete. As one author recently noted, “the U.S. is well advised to leverage the enormous size, effectiveness, and agility of private-sector capital against China’s substantial but ‘clumsy capital.’” In service of these goals, the United States has free trade agreements with a substantial portion of the LAC region. This architecture, built over decades, gives it advantages over the CCP in furnishing private-sector alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with curtailment strategies, out of both necessity and resource scarcity, the United States should prioritize only a handful of areas in which it can provide a meaningful and competitive alternative to Chinese development and investment in the region. Examples include ICT and digital connectivity, mining and critical minerals, renewable energy, and healthcare systems. To accomplish this, the U.S. government will have to rewrite rules that constrain the agility of agencies like the Development Finance Corporation (DFC) to aid middle-income regions like LAC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, an important note on messaging is in order. In pursuing this three-pronged strategy, the United States should project a desire to enhance the hemispheric relationship and ensure its policy autonomy, rather than present an approach that emphasizes anti-China policies and the dangers of the Chinese Communist Party. The strategy should go beyond China and be aimed at strengthening the region’s democratic institutions, fighting its entrenched corruption, and catalyzing its economic development. Notwithstanding China’s current impact, countries in LAC often have a different perspective than the United States with respect to China’s role in the region. Facing domestic economic challenges, governments in LAC are much more responsive to the immediate benefits of China’s engagement and display ostensibly little concern for the second-order impacts of unsustainable debt, vulnerability to coercion, and democratic backsliding that typically occur on a longer time horizon. Due to these differences in perspective and the importance of allies in shaping effective policy, the United States will need to be more intentional with its public diplomacy to ensure that any new policies in the region are seen in the context of a willing partner ready to help, as opposed to a defensive partner seeking to minimize China’s influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. policymakers generally understand that diplomatic statements criticizing China and suggesting that LAC forgo its relationship with China and align with the United States do not play well in the region. As one scholar observes: “The U.S. must thus work to refine its communication, within the boundaries of honesty, to credibly emphasize its interest in the well-being of the region to which it is connected by geography, commerce, and family.” Particularly, messaging strategy should emphasize preserving the policy autonomy of LAC, as well as a U.S. desire to fortify democratic, market-oriented institutions that will allow the region to engage on a more equal playing field with all countries in the world—not just China. Doubling down on the importance of market-led growth and the U.S. private sector will be even more important in light of China’s push to expand its statist model and the region’s turn to greater state-led policy solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implementing this strategy will require appropriating resources through relevant agencies to insulate LAC more effectively from the most corrosive elements of China’s engagement. Policymakers should understand the importance of pursuing this three-pronged grand strategy so that foreign policy resources in LAC are not outsourced to other regions. Due to the global nature of U.S. strategy, resources are often moved from LAC to other theaters in times of crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key agencies that can ensure that these resource constraints do not present themselves include the National Security Council (NSC), the Department of State, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and the DFC, among others. These agencies are critical to high-level diplomatic engagement, messaging, economic development strategy, and commercial engagement. They are the logical place to begin with the implementation of grand strategy in LAC. Multilateral organizations and the private sector will also be crucial for the United States’ revamped efforts in the region. Beyond highlighting common ground with aspects of the region’s agenda, the United States would be best served by returning to the basics and helping governments remember that the private sector is the best engine of economic growth and human initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The three-pronged approach championed in this report implies deep U.S. engagement and partnership with LAC to an extent that has not existed in the twenty-first century.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of this report proceeds in three broad sections, each corresponding to an element of the three-pronged grand strategy. First, it assesses aspects of China’s engagement with LAC, identifying where the United States should help insulate countries from the riskiest and most adverse impacts of that engagement. Second, it offers recommendations for the aspects of China’s engagement with the region that the United States should seek to curtail—an unsettled debate among policymakers. Finally, the report concludes with an argument for the priority industries in which the United States should seek to engage in competition, those where a fully resourced policy will allow them to furnish viable alternatives to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;insulate&quot;&gt;Insulate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most aspects of China’s engagement with LAC will continue, given the region’s need for economic growth and development. Directly interfering with China’s engagement could also confirm the suspicion of many countries in LAC that the United States is a self-interested hegemon. As such, in these areas, there are ways in which the United States can act to help countries insulate themselves from China’s corrosive impact without appearing to pursue anti-China policies. The United States should ensure that the interactions between China and its partners in the region occur in a transparent fashion and on a level playing field. A recent poll by the International Republican Institute shows that majorities of citizens in four key LAC countries are unaware of the CCP’s influence and China’s investment in their countries. By promoting transparency, providing technical assistance, establishing safeguards against corruption, and strengthening institutional support mechanisms, the United States can enable partners to strengthen their internal frameworks for investment and external engagement. This section proceeds with an analysis of China’s commercial and development engagement followed by its institutional engagement and provides mechanisms for insulating countries from adverse impacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;commercial-and-development-engagement&quot;&gt;Commercial and Development Engagement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s approach toward strengthening its own economy has led it to engage with LAC in many critical sectors. As leftist populist governments emerge throughout the region, leaders are arguably more receptive to increased Chinese engagement as well as to internal policies that may lead to democratic deficits (albeit China’s presence is now hemisphere-wide). Venezuela serves as an illustrative example of ever-closer engagement with China that has coincided with dramatic democratic backsliding. Chinese economic assistance under both Hugo Chávez and Nicolás Maduro allowed Venezuela to maintain authoritarian governance mechanisms that have pulled it away from the democratic traditions and regional institutions of the hemisphere. Backsliding has spread to other countries like Brazil, Colombia, and Peru, which are all increasingly turning to China for economic assistance. Without strong institutions and insulation mechanisms to protect democracy, these countries could witness varying levels of democratic backsliding, given the nature of China’s engagement. Long-term impacts on democracy have been demonstrated to be most prominent in China’s infrastructure investment and within the region’s extractive industry, as well as within its lending practices, violations of labor standards, and laws protecting the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding infrastructure, President Xi Jinping has established ambitious trade and investment goals with the region, embodied by the fact that 21 LAC countries have signed onto China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in just the past three and a half years—with more expected in the coming years. From a U.S. perspective, focusing messaging on the BRI as “debt-trap diplomacy”—irrespective of its veracity—does not find a receptive audience in LAC because investment is urgently needed in the region. Without an alternative, the Chinese offer is the best offer because it is often the only offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the United States cannot and should not attempt to block BRI investment in the region, it can ensure that BRI investments are made in a transparent framework that protects countries from unsustainable debt. While the G7’s Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) is the United States’ recently announced alternative to the BRI, it will take years before it potentially competes with China’s infrastructure investment—if ever. Nonetheless, the United States should fuel investment from PGII to LAC as an alternative to the BRI. Given the level of investment needed, the United States will need to insulate the region from the corrosive impacts that these large infrastructure investment deals can have. For instance, China’s presence in the energy sectors of various countries should be cause for alarm. In Brazil, Chinese companies own or partially own over 300 power plants, accounting for 10 percent of Brazil’s national energy generation capacity. Additionally, Chinese companies own 12 percent of Brazil’s energy transmission infrastructure. Both pose significant points of potential leverage for the CCP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to infrastructure, China has also made large investments in the region’s extractive industries, especially in the critical mineral supply chain. Large investments in this space have allowed China to establish strategic footholds in various countries throughout the region. Just as with infrastructure, however, how corrosive these investments’ impacts on democracy are depends on the stability and strength of a country’s institutions. Chile’s copper and lithium industries, for instance, have been regulated at the national level for several decades, and the strength of its framework for foreign investment has insulated it better than other countries from the negative impacts that could emerge from growing Chinese investment. Argentina, on the other hand, does not have the same institutional frameworks, being governed at the local and provincial level with little accountability; amid economic turmoil and growing commercial engagement with China, the country could witness backsliding from unregulated economic involvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka’s current political and economic crisis demonstrates several key lessons on how the United States can help countries in LAC avoid the most democracy-eroding impacts of increased Chinese commercial and development engagement. While Sri Lanka carries much of the blame for its ongoing debt crisis, China’s lending practices have played an outsized role. Sri Lanka’s experience provides a crucial lesson for the Western Hemisphere: avoid investment deals for both infrastructure and extractive industries that might lead to unsustainable debt burdens and provide countries with the necessary tools for evaluating future deals. Furthermore, it also shows that the United States should work to protect countries from incurring subsequent debt and restructuring existing debt that will not further deteriorate into economic crises. Recent studies on this topic demonstrate that China is likely to respond to overindebted countries either with new lines of credit or, concerningly, currency swap deals that open new avenues of potential political leverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context of increasing Chinese economic engagement, there are several ways in which the United States could move to insulate the region from China’s corrosive influence. Effective solutions include promoting investment principles, providing technical assistance for debt restructuring, offering support for transparency, and strengthening partners’ institutions and transaction processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;1-promote-quality-infrastructure-investment-qii-principles&quot;&gt;1. Promote quality infrastructure investment (QII) principles.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One crucial mechanism through which the United States should insulate the region from China’s BRI investments is by promoting quality infrastructure investment principles. Fortunately, the United States, Japan, and Australia have cofounded a certification mechanism for infrastructure projects that meet robust international quality infrastructure investment principles. This initiative, the Blue Dot Network, should continue to be pursued on a global scale so that the United States can help create more transparency and quality data for development projects in LAC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department of State should aim to make Blue Dot principles a standard for any new infrastructure projects in the region, including those through the BRI and PGII. As an already under-resourced region, LAC should be made a key priority for the United States when pursuing infrastructure investment principles. This will help countries in the region have access to more information on the track record of certain companies when pursuing large infrastructure deals that have the potential to increase their debt burden. In this capacity, the Blue Dot Network serves as an international institutional mechanism that can strengthen commercial and development engagement in the region, thereby insulating countries from the potential adverse impacts of infrastructure investment deals. (The Blue Dot Network is certainly not the only workable framework; there are others that could serve as strong frameworks for insulation mechanisms, such as the United Kingdom’s New Engineering Contracts, which have been used successfully in Peru.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this same workstream, the United States should also work with cofounders Japan and Australia, as well as other allies like South Korea and Taiwan, to contribute to the development of democratic principles in LAC. Bringing allies into the conversation about infrastructure principles in the region may catalyze a larger conversation on how extra-hemispheric actors can provide resources for further democratic development. For instance, both Japan and South Korea have a vested interest in the lithium industry, with companies like Japanese Toyota Tsusho and South Korean steelmaker Posco having large investments in lithium extraction sites in Argentina. It is in the interest of both Japan and South Korea as well as the United States for governments to cooperate to establish stronger investment principles within the lithium industry, for the benefit of both the region and their own companies. As a broader line of work, the United States should engage with allies that already have an economic interest in strengthening democratic principles for commercial and development engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;2-provide-technical-assistance-and-establish-safeguards-for-debt-vulnerable-countries&quot;&gt;2. Provide technical assistance and establish safeguards for debt-vulnerable countries.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another mechanism to help insulate the region from China’s adverse impacts is to help countries restructure debt resulting from Chinese sovereign lending and to protect these debt-vulnerable countries from incurring subsequent Chinese debt by increasing technical assistance and establishing safeguards. The Department of the Treasury’s Office of Technical Assistance (OTA) should increase its engagement with regional partners to ensure that countries do not incur large amounts of subsequent debt on deals that could further disrupt their economies. As a lesson from Sri Lanka’s current debt crisis, the United States should encourage countries to work through the Paris Club and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to restructure their debt and establish this as a safeguard to ensure that countries in the region do not incur further debt. Through the Paris Club, both Argentina and Suriname have been able to restructure their debt in ways that may allow them to address current economic challenges at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the United States should also provide a capital increase for the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) to strengthen its ability to help countries in LAC achieve sustainable and serviceable debt structures. The State Department should advance diplomatic engagement with members of the IDB to work on increasing capital for the explicit purpose of providing safeguards to protect debt-vulnerable countries. By increasing the strength and abilities of the Paris Club, the IMF, and the IDB, the United States can help countries in the region avoid situations like what occurred in Ecuador under President Rafael Correa, when the country had to pay off its Chinese debt with oil. Two presidents later, Ecuador still struggles to pay down its Chinese debt, and direct negotiations with Beijing on debt relief have yielded little in savings on the outstanding debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;3-support-transparency-measures-in-infrastructure-and-extractive-industries&quot;&gt;3. Support transparency measures in infrastructure and extractive industries.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After its withdrawal from the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) in 2017, the United States should reconsider becoming an implementing member once again. The EITI aims to improve transparency standards, strengthen the governance of critical minerals, mitigate corruption risks across the value chain, and increase contract and data disclosure requirements. Only 11 countries in LAC are currently implementing members of EITI: Argentina, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Mexico, Peru, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago. If the United States joined, this could catalyze other countries in the region to strengthen their own extractive sectors. Moreover, while the United States provides support for EITI implementation through USAID, as exemplified by its bilateral assistance to members like Colombia and Guyana, as an implementing member the United States could further demonstrate its work as a partner to countries in the region working to embed transparency in their extractive industries. Increasing the United States’ focus on these standards would help insulate LAC from corrosive impacts to democracy by further protecting industries that will be critical for the future. In this context, the United States should both seek to join EITI and increase USAID funding through EITI explicitly for bilateral assistance to countries in the region as a step for safeguarding institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The region’s vibrant civil societies should be seen as allies in this effort, since one of the most effective ways to expose China’s practices is through public scrutiny. When evidence of corruption, poor labor standards, and environmental abuses have come to light, several Chinese investment projects in the region have been canceled. Basic research and data collection, funneled to watchdog organizations, journalists, media outlets, and academics can help to amplify the denouncement of bad practices. Additionally, such information sharing would have the benefit of making these denouncements take on local character, as opposed to coming from the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another idea worthy of further exploration is the use of state-regulated trust funds for public investments. Trust funds for public infrastructure projects should be managed by private financial entities; in LAC, prudential regulation is strong and one of the best in the developing world. For instance, Colombia has positive experiences with the use of trust funds for public investment to execute projects faster, with higher quality, and largely corruption-free. High transparency standards mean corrosive Chinese investment could be curtailed while simultaneously attracting more Western investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;4-strengthen-institutional-and-transactional-support&quot;&gt;4. Strengthen institutional and transactional support.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s reputation for deploying resources without imposing the slightest conditions can be dangerous for countries in the region. Lax institutions and processes are prone to elite capture, corruption, breakdown of rule of law, and other types of corrosive impacts on large commercial and development deals. Given that China’s engagement with the region is more recent compared to its engagement elsewhere, many governments also lack a depth of skills and knowledge on engaging with Chinese partners. To strengthen institutions and processes, the Department of State could lead programs that would help countries with contract evaluation and broad project planning support. Furthermore, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) should increase its partnerships with countries in LAC to strengthen their own foreign investment review mechanisms. Indeed, the State Department, in combination with regional embassies, could conduct a “CFIUS roadshow” to share best practices with the region’s governments and work with those countries that do not have investment review platforms to create ones that are in line with the national security interests of their countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are strong incentives to reform procurement systems across the region to help build more quickly and protect bureaucrats from legal prosecution. Red tape, the lowest-price criteria to select winners in infrastructure projects, a paucity of bidders in each tender process, and a dearth of human capital in procurement agencies are some of the region’s greatest challenges today. Lowest-price criteria mean that Chinese bids face little competition—often they are the only bids—because the lowest price is established too low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;institutional-engagement&quot;&gt;Institutional Engagement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its institutional engagement, China has aggressively sought to broaden its influence in multilateral institutions across the region. China has forged ties with several regional organizations, including the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), and the Bolivarian Alliance for the People of our Americas (ALBA). It has also gained access to development funds from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), despite not being part of the Western Hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the U.S. perspective, China’s engagement with CELAC is the most concerning of all institutions, as CELAC excludes both the United States and Canada and therefore gives China more leeway in working with countries in the region. Moreover, countries such as Mexico and Argentina have demonstrated a desire to conduct regional matters through CELAC—as opposed to through the long-standing traditional forum, the Organization of American States (OAS), which is committed to defending democracy in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s agenda within institutions like CELAC and the IDB may not necessarily lead to corrosive impacts on democracy, but its ability to frame a more favorable view of Chinese commercial and development engagement could lead to long-term spillover effects for the region’s democracies if they are not insulated prior to increased engagement. While larger countries in the region have led the charge away from the OAS, Central American countries like El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras are backsliding, and a lack of U.S. involvement in the region’s institutions could allow democratic weaknesses to continue festering in these countries. The United States’ current approach of remaining silent and using discreet diplomatic efforts to work with its partners is allowing allies like Mexico to push further against policies that support the region’s democracies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, to the extent possible, the United States should work to insulate LAC from the potential long-term effects of increased Chinese engagement in the region’s institutions. In this regard, helpful solutions might include incentives for conducting regional business through the OAS and shaping the United States’ participation in regional forums as a partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;1-provide-incentives-to-countries-to-conduct-their-most-important-matters-through-the-oas&quot;&gt;1. Provide incentives to countries to conduct their most important matters through the OAS.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure that the United States remains an active leader in the region’s commercial and development engagement, it needs to continue to be a key member of the region’s institutions. If countries turn fully to CELAC to solve regional challenges, the United States will not be able to provide its assistance for ensuring that the region’s commercial and development deals are transparent and democratic. As such, to incentivize countries to commit to the OAS, the United States could offer a reorganization of the institution. For instance, it could create a new council that puts the United States on an equal membership status with large regional players like Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, and Mexico, some of which have been leaning toward CELAC. Additionally, it could offer more U.S. support as it pertains to security cooperation in the region by allocating more resources to the Unites States Southern Command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;2-shape-the-us-governments-participation-in-regional-forums-as-a-partner&quot;&gt;2. Shape the U.S. government’s participation in regional forums as a partner.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the 2022 Summit of the Americas, countries in the region were disappointed with the lack of resources and new initiatives from the United States. Additionally, several countries boycotted the summit—including Mexico, El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala—due to the United States’ decision to not invite Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Cuba. President Alberto Fernández of Argentina delivered a critical speech of the United States’ past policy decisions. The United States will not be able to insulate LAC if the region is not willing to accept its assistance. In this context, the United States needs to be a more active participant in regional forums and needs to deliver on its promises. While the Summit of the Americas may have been a good opportunity for it, the United States should still act to address the concerns of its regional partners. It can do so by increasing resources and acting as a partner for the region’s development. This may include a restructuring of the IDB and the OAS, but the changes that are made must be in conversation with partners in the region if they are to be successful in shifting the institutional climate. The driving question must remain what the United States can do with the region—not for the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;curtail&quot;&gt;Curtail&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given its direct impact on democracy, there are areas where China’s involvement should be curtailed. Many countries in the region face political instability, social unrest, and weakening democracy. In consolidated authoritarian regimes, like Venezuela, China has provided surveillance technologies and other financial support to uphold the Maduro regime. This type of support has also spread to other countries experiencing authoritarian tendencies, such as El Salvador and Guatemala. Further, through its Digital Silk Road, China provided Ecuador with 4,000 Chinese-made cameras for a “smart cities” program aimed at reducing crime—but at the same time shared the video footage with the feared domestic intelligence agency under President Rafael Correa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is in this context that some of China’s engagement needs to not only be insulated but fully kept out in order to avoid a permanent turn away from democracy. This corresponds to the United States’ “redlines” for Chinese engagement in the region. As the United States shapes these policies, it will be important to take into consideration which of its concerns are shared with LAC countries, because curtailing aspects of China’s engagement will require partnership with U.S. allies in the region. From the United States’ perspective, the most pressing aspect of engagement to curtail falls in the ICT sector. Due to the potentially destructive impacts that untrusted Chinese 5G vendors and the use of surveillance technologies could have on governance and democracy, the United States should continue its efforts to curtail them. The most challenging aspect of this part of the strategy is that most countries in the region do not see the negative impacts on democratic governments of China’s ICT engagement the same way the United States does. However, by the time LAC sees these negative impacts, it may be too late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ict-5g-networks-and-surveillance-technologies&quot;&gt;ICT: 5G Networks and Surveillance Technologies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the primary areas of China’s engagement that the United States should seek to curtail is the ICT industry, from untrusted 5G vendors to Chinese-provided surveillance technologies. In established autocracies like Venezuela and Cuba, China has intentionally undermined democracy by providing surveillance technologies to the Maduro Regime and restricting internet service during Cuba’s protests in July of 2021. State-owned enterprises, like China’s National Electronics Import and Export Corporation (CEIEC), and Chinese technology companies, like Huawei and ZTE, are equally as dangerous when it comes to challenging democratic institutions in the region. As it pertains to private investment and corporate relations, China’s state-driven capitalist model has made it difficult to ascertain when and where companies are acting of their own accord or in the furtherance of Chinese state policy. Continued controversy over China’s untrusted 5G vendors illustrates this challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a difficult conversation to have with partners in LAC, as they receive digital services and technologies from China that the United States cannot yet offer. The Clean Network initiative advanced during the Trump administration demonstrates the region’s different viewpoint on this matter clearly. Nearly 60 countries around the world joined the Clean Network. However, only three of those were in LAC: Brazil, the Dominican Republic, and Ecuador. Even though the Biden administration has chosen not to pursue the Clean Network initiative, countries in the region were not very receptive to the original plan. For example, despite Brazil having joined the Clean Network in November 2020, in early 2021 it backed out of its commitment when it allowed Huawei to participate in its 5G auction—in large part because China was withholding vaccines from Brazil during the depths of the pandemic as a bargaining chip. Moreover, Ecuador joined the initiative as part of a deal with the DFC in which it would receive nearly $2.8 billion to pay off Chinese loans (similarly to the Clean Networks initiative, the Biden administration has since abandoned this deal). This context demonstrates that the argument for greater transparency in telecommunications has not worked in the region, as countries merely seek the most effective and cost-efficient option—which in many cases has been Huawei. As countries in the region struggle economically, limiting telecommunications options can be damaging to the United States’ foreign policy if there are no other options that are comparatively similar from a cost standpoint. For this reason, the ICT sector is an area in which the United States should seek to curtail Chinese involvement, but it must also find ways to provide a competitive alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;1-reduce-the-gap-between-huawei-and-other-5g-competitors&quot;&gt;1. Reduce the gap between Huawei and other 5G competitors.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huawei leads the 5G industry in LAC with at least 30 percent of the market share, in large part because of Chinese subsidies that make the cost of infrastructure and network service lower than what unsubsidized competitors can provide. Directly banning Chinese vendors from the region has proven to be an ineffective strategy, and as such, the United States and its allies should work to provide a feasible alternative that would curtail increased Chinese market participation. The United States should consider heavier use of industrial policy in conjunction with the European Union, Japan, Australia, and Korea, among other allies, to help 5G competitors—like Eriksson and Nokia—to reduce the financial burden on countries in LAC if they choose to go with an alternative that is not Huawei. Through reforms to Export-Import Bank (EXIM) rules, such as lowering American content requirements for export credits, the United States would be able to support the development of Eriksson, Nokia, and other trusted vendors in the region, despite them not being U.S. companies. Additionally, through PGII, the United States should prioritize its digital pillar to mobilize investment in the ICT sector with trusted vendors. As part of this effort, DFC funding could be used to bring in trusted vendors into countries like Ecuador, a country with which the DFC already has an agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;2-prevent-the-expansion-of-surveillance-technology-systems&quot;&gt;2. Prevent the expansion of surveillance technology systems.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments in LAC have accepted the use of surveillance technologies at an increasing rate, with many countries citing them as a solution to reducing crime and increasing public safety. In a region where military dictatorships governed in the not-too-distant past, the use of surveillance technologies feeds into a worrying trend of democratic backsliding. Growing use of surveillance presents a dilemma for democratic governments as they seek to make their countries safer at the expense of the privacy of their citizens. The Department of State should convey the adverse effects of surveillance technologies to regional partners and work with them to increase accountability and transparency in deals that countries sign with companies providing these new technologies. In the worst cases, the U.S. government should consider the Treasury Department’s ability to use sanctions—as it has elsewhere—against companies providing surveillance technologies to U.S. allies. However, as long as the region’s homicides continue to represent such an outsized percentage of global homicides—usually around one-third of the global total, despite the region representing just 8 percent of the global population—the temptation for surveillance technology will be strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parallel efforts should be made in the space of data protection. The United States could promote the adherence of LAC governments to the Data Protection Law International Treaty. The treaty, formally known as the Convention 108 and born in the European Union has 55 signatories, three of them in LAC (Argentina, Mexico, and Uruguay). Convention 108 imposes minimum standards for personal data protection to prevent abuses from national and foreign governments. Treaty signatories are required to create an autonomous agency to adhere to its principles. The Treaty is important because China does not recognize personal data protection as a right, and Chinese law states that if a country imposes limits on China’s access to personal data, corrective measures can be taken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;strengthen-regional-ict-and-cybersecurity-cooperation&quot;&gt;Strengthen regional ICT and cybersecurity cooperation.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another mechanism to prevent untrusted vendors from further disseminating throughout the region is to strengthen regional ICT and cybersecurity cooperation. As one of the least developed regions in terms of its digital environment, LAC is struggling to cultivate human capital for cybersecurity. While the OAS’s Inter-American Committee Against Terrorism (CICTE) has experience in developing national cybersecurity strategies, there is no targeted effort at cybersecurity for telecommunications. Through CISA Global within the Department of Homeland Security, the United States could seek to increase capacity building with regional partners as a method for improving the overall digital environment as it pertains to telecommunications. As the ICT sector continues to grow in the region, capacity-building efforts can help protect countries as broadband investment expands. To prevent the further expansion of untrusted vendors, the United States should work with the IDB to establish policies that would eliminate ICT projects with untrusted vendors in the region and help countries institutionalize processes that increase their capacity to screen potential ICT infrastructure suppliers for transparency and privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;compete&quot;&gt;Compete&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since its arrival in the region, China has invested large amounts of funding in both commercial engagement and development assistance with countries in LAC. Through its investments, China has changed the regional status quo and attempted to “rewire” the region’s commerce through Beijing, to the point that it is becoming a more influential geopolitical player than the United States in many respects. For instance, China is the region’s second-largest trading partner after the United States and the number one trading partner when accounting only for South America. These trade relationships are the basis for partnerships in the region, as many other critical policy decisions are made based on their impact on trade with other countries. While some of China’s commercial and development engagement benefits LAC, U.S.-based alternatives that establish democratic safeguards and transparency can help increase the options available to countries in the region as they pursue economic development initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this reason, another crucial component of a revamped U.S. strategy in LAC needs to involve channeling resources into industries where the United States can provide viable alternatives to China. While the United States cannot be competitive in every industry, it should reform its strategy to focus on areas in which competing can create a level playing field and strengthen U.S. participation in the region to showcase the importance of democratic traditions. As the United States seeks to ally-shore and nearshore supply chains, it should do so in the critical industries of the future that will help both the United States and LAC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a region that is unlikely to see a substantial boost in federal funds and policy attention from U.S. policymakers, the United States will be most effective if it chooses a few key priority areas in which to compete with China so that it can make the best use of its limited resources. It is better to understand the domestic and institutional constraints rather than failing to deliver on promises to partners. For instance, the United States has found it challenging to implement new free trade agreements (FTAs) in the region due to domestic constraints. While China is negotiating FTAs with countries like Ecuador and Uruguay, the United States should focus on what it can do in the region, as opposed to promising FTAs that it cannot achieve because of fractious trade politics. In this context, some of the industries in which the United States can and should be competing with China in LAC include ICT and digital connectivity, mining and critical minerals, renewable energy, and healthcare systems. Fortunately, these are also areas in which LAC governments have a strong interest in cooperating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A large part of the U.S. strategy will rely on multilateral engagement and private sector-led growth, which could necessitate a heavier use of industrial policy and the development of attractive investment frameworks to further incentivize the private sector to engage with LAC countries. Increasing ties in these industries will require a whole-of-government approach to allocate additional resources to the region. It will require the DFC, USAID, and other relevant agencies to engage in creating a better investment climate in countries across the area. It will also require leveraging U.S. influence at the IDB and the IMF to bring in resources. Given the aforementioned shortage of federal funds for LAC, to be a competitive player in the region the United States will need a strong policy revamp, with many government agencies, multilateral institutions, and private sector companies playing a role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;1-scale-up-ict-and-digital-connectivity-efforts&quot;&gt;1. Scale up ICT and digital connectivity efforts.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broadband connectivity and digital technologies will increase at a rapid rate in LAC over the next several years, with the 5G market alone projected to generate over $28 billion in revenue by 2030. As the region begins to scale up 5G infrastructure, however, Huawei and ZTE are better positioned than competitors like Eriksson and Nokia due to lower costs and existing infrastructure. Huawei, already predominant, possesses a unique opportunity to further consolidate the market if policies are not established to limit the ability of untrusted vendors to operate in the region. Digital and technological communications need to be at the top of the United States’ national security agenda, especially given the large market opening in LAC to increase broadband connectivity and advance digitalization efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the United States may not be able to compete outright with 5G infrastructure (given the absence of a U.S. company in this arena), it can leverage multilateral engagement and infrastructure investment through PGII in digital connectivity to provide alternative ICT development funding. Through a capital increase at the IDB, the United States can work with other countries to emphasize digital transformation and ICT development throughout the region and increase the institution’s focus on ICT. Moreover, the United States has pledged significant funding through PGII to develop, expand, and deploy secure ICT networks and infrastructure, which includes working with trusted vendors to provide 5G and even 6G technologies. Providing funding for digital infrastructure development in the region will be crucial as an alternative to allowing Huawei to continue to expand its market share. A larger U.S. presence in the ICT sector within LAC can help shape one of the critical industries of the future in line with transparent and democratic traditions that allow for a level playing field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;2-leverage-partnerships-on-mining-and-critical-minerals&quot;&gt;2. Leverage partnerships on mining and critical minerals.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critical minerals are essential to meeting the demands of the clean energy transition, as they will play a large role in decarbonization efforts, including the electrification of vehicles and energy storage technologies. As a region, LAC will be a crucial player in this industry as large reserves of lithium, copper, and nickel—among other critical minerals—are found in large quantities in several countries in the region. Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, and the rest of the Americas possess over 70 percent of the globe’s lithium reserves. Moreover, Chile, Peru, and Mexico hold approximately 40 percent of the globe’s copper reserves. On its own, Brazil also hosts 17 percent of the world’s nickel reserves. Critical minerals will be one of the economically impactful industries of the future as the world decarbonizes, and given Latin America’s natural resource endowment, it will be at the center of this industry. While China has approached this industry strategically for the last decade, it by no means has a chokehold over the entire mining space. As it stands, the demand for critical minerals will outpace supply, which gives the United States ample opportunity to increase its competitiveness in this sector through partnerships with countries in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be more competitive in the critical mineral industry, the U.S. private sector needs to be involved in the early stages of mining and extraction as well as the processing of critical minerals for their downstream end uses. The U.S. government can help to create enabling conditions and de-risking investments so that the private sector can become more involved. This might include financial policies, such as federal grants from the Department of Energy for critical mineral projects in LAC, tax credits for new technologies to increase the productivity of mining processes, and increased loan guarantees and project finance opportunities. The United States can also support greater competitiveness in the critical mineral industry through diplomatic policies, such as by leveraging the Department of State’s Energy Resource Governance Initiative (ERGI) to create regional critical mineral partnerships, expand geological partnerships, improve knowledge-sharing with the private sector on projects in the region, and negotiate trade provisions with regional partners that might increase critical minerals trade. Greater U.S. participation—both in the private sector and from the U.S. government—will help shape the critical mineral industry in LAC to ensure that transparency and standards are in place across the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;3-accelerate-renewable-energy-potential&quot;&gt;3. Accelerate renewable energy potential.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LAC and the United States also share a strong policy priority in increasing renewable energy investment. The United States’ commitment to renewable energy, stronger than China’s, presents an opportunity for increasing collaboration and economic ties with LAC. As recently as 2019, the region launched the Renewable Energy for Latin America and the Caribbean Initiative (RELAC), with the objective of achieving 70 percent renewable energy participation in the region’s electricity matrix by 2030. RELAC brings the IDB and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) together to support the region’s renewable energy transition. Renewable energy will be a crucial sector for LAC as countries seek to bolster their economic development, increase climate resilience, and further their decarbonization efforts. In addition to opportunities in wind, solar, hydro, and geothermal sources of energy, LAC also has the potential to be a large player in green hydrogen. Chile is set to be one of the world’s largest exporters of the green hydrogen that will drive much of the clean energy transition in the years to come. By tying the energy transition to climate priorities, the United States has an opportunity to partner with countries in the region to provide necessary funding and support for increasing economic development and creating a more sustainable future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one of the most promising regions for economic development, the United States should prioritize renewable energy projects in LAC. This will include bringing in resources from the public sector, multilateral organizations, and the private sector, as well as using the influence of the U.S. government to mobilize additional capital and resources into the region. At a high level, the NSC should ensure that LAC becomes a priority under PGII so that funding for climate and energy infrastructure is secured for the region. From the public sector, this will require the DFC to increase financing projects in LAC—such as the $100 million it announced at the Summit of the Americas—that serve to address climate and renewable priorities. Initiatives like the U.S. Caribbean Partnership to Address the Climate Crisis 2030 (PACC 2030) are a crucial step in allocating additional resources to energy security in the region. The United States could consider becoming more involved in RELAC to further support renewable energy efforts. In addition to increasing public sector resources, the State and Treasury Departments should work together to increase access to financing from the IDB and provide incentives for U.S. businesses to make crucial investments in renewable energy. Wherever possible, the United States should tie energy investment to the modernization of regulatory structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;4-strengthen-healthcare-systems-in-the-post-covid-19-environment&quot;&gt;4. Strengthen healthcare systems in the post-Covid-19 environment.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With over 2.7 million deaths since the beginning of the pandemic, the LAC region has accounted for over 40 percent of global deaths related to Covid-19. Given the extent of the Covid-19 crisis and China’s increasing use of “vaccine diplomacy” as a method for expanding its influence in the region, healthcare and vaccine development represent another area in which the United States could offer an alternative so that China cannot use vaccines as a bargaining chip, as it did in Brazil, to extract strategic concessions. As such, the United States should provide increased resources and partner with countries in LAC to help develop better healthcare systems to aid in the region’s recovery from Covid-19 and prepare for future pandemics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration announced action in healthcare for LAC in June 2022, which included initiatives like the Americas Health Corps to provide training to over 500,000 public health professionals across the region as well as expanding USAID’s global health security programs to more countries. These announcements are critical steps to providing increased support to regional partners, and the United States should deliver on these promises—both to increase resilience and, more importantly in the long term, to strengthen LAC’s trust in its ally to the north. Increasing collaboration on healthcare systems and strengthening the region’s preparation for future pandemics will help shape a stronger partnership between the United States and its partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within this bucket, greater partnership must include vaccine development. Production and continuous research on vaccines is a national priority in many countries throughout LAC, as well as a regional priority. Vaccine development can create jobs, promote the sharing of technology, and improve healthcare services. Most importantly, the region is full of strong potential partner institutions owing to its years of research in tropical medicine and emerging diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;toward-a-grand-strategy&quot;&gt;Toward a Grand Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Western Hemisphere will be crucial to U.S. grand strategy in an era of great power competition. It is imperative for U.S. policymakers to have a better understanding of the adverse impacts of Chinese engagement in LAC so that U.S. efforts to safeguard democracy can be incisive and effective. Taking steps to work with regional partners on insulation mechanisms that increase transparency and strengthen democratic institutions will be critical to protecting the democratic traditions of the region in the long term. These actions will further reduce the asymmetries of the China-LAC relationship and allow countries in the region to engage on more equal terms. While most of China’s engagement will likely continue, it will become less and less corrosive to democracy over time. The U.S. government will also need to increase its ability to curtail certain aspects of that engagement, such as the expansion of untrusted ICT vendors in the region. Finally, a critical part of a new U.S. grand strategy will be better prioritizing existing federal funds toward economic, diplomatic, and security initiatives to compete with China and offer credible alternatives that are democracy-preserving in key industries of the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the strategy of “insulate, curtail, compete” is about helping LAC to assert greater policy autonomy, reduce dependency and foreign influence, and to make better choices about the region’s long-term strategic interests. Effectively selling the region on those choices will be a key challenge and require diplomatic finesse to understand that various subregions of LAC may desire different combinations of insulation, curtailment, and competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has long been a partner and ally for countries in LAC. Communication and partnership will be of the utmost importance for a grand strategy built for an era of renewed geopolitical competition, and aiming to protect LAC’s democratic traditions should be a top U.S. priority. Moving beyond the United States’ national security interests to show allies that the United States has an interest in LAC’s economic development can demonstrate to the region that its long-standing partner will continue to be a pillar and source of democratic stability for decades to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（10日）踏入審訊第56天。施德來昨快測陽性，獲安排於延伸庭就坐，其代表大律師黃廷光今指施昨晚確診，獲批4天病假，他今有到庭，惟望押後一天審訊作休息，獲法官批准，辯方指施的事務律師同樣呈陽性。法官關注審訊進度，指控方案情似乎將完結。控方確認已傳召所有主要證人，並將應何桂藍和陳志全要求傳召一名選舉主任，及約10名與證物鏈相關的警察證人，另傳召兩至三名證人讓辯方盤問，法官着控辯雙方善用時間商討能否減省證人數量。傍晚司法機構網頁顯示，案件明天未安排審訊，將繼續休庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施德來確診獲批4天病假-申押後一天審訊&quot;&gt;施德來確診獲批4天病假 申押後一天審訊&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施德來昨早快速測試陽性，獲安排與事務律師到一號延伸庭就坐。代表施的大律師黃廷光今甫開庭便表示，施昨晚求診後確診新冠肺炎，獲批出4天病假。施今晨仍有到庭，惟希望押後一天審訊，以好好休息和康復。他知道情況不理想，會交由法庭決定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;主控萬德豪表示，控方打算應何桂藍和陳志全要求傳召時任新界東選舉主任楊蕙心（Amy Yeung），其證供亦只與兩名被告有關。惟法官李運騰指，問題是他們能否在被告的缺席下繼續審訊，形容是困難的決定，又指在非常例外的情況才能這樣做，這亦不安全。法官陳慶偉指，只是一天的押後，他們亦沒有什麼選擇。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指將傳召約10名證物鏈相關證人-官着雙方善用今天時間商討&quot;&gt;控方指將傳召約10名證物鏈相關證人 官着雙方善用今天時間商討&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續關注案件進度，指似乎控方案情將要完結。萬德豪指，在楊蕙心後尚會傳召多10至11名與何桂藍及吳政亨的證物鏈有關的警察證人，指是有關尚未納入同意事實的證物，此後尚會傳召兩至三名證人讓辯方盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 表示，預計該些證人所需時間非常短，他亦只關注檢取證物的過程，而非之後如何處理證物。李運騰問是否需要10個或以上證人，Beel 指會於早上與控方商討，李着雙方善用今天的時間，Beel 表示明白，指主要關注戴耀廷的證物及從被告檢取的證物，而非移送證物的過程。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方確認已傳召所有主要證人&quot;&gt;控方確認已傳召所有主要證人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，控方是否已傳召本案所有主要證人，萬德豪確認。李續指，辯方是時候要與當事人商討是否要傳召證人或作供，又重申他對案件的進度有點關注。Beel 指知道控方就 Facebook 和 YouTube 等有專家證人，萬回應控方不打算傳召專家證人。李再指，辯方亦要就是否提出無須答辯索指示，Beel 補充指還有「共謀者原則」的陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉最後指，批准案件押後至明天早上，並向黃廷光指，若施德來明天仍不適，需於日內告知法庭。黃表示，施的事務律師昨晚亦呈陽性，李運騰即說「那你一定要保重（“Then you must take care.”）」。審訊約10分鐘結束，散庭時坐在後排的大律師沈士文笑着拿出消毒噴霧四周噴了數下。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;傍晚司法機構網頁顯示，案件明天未安排審訊，將繼續休庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪受審，自周三（10日）起因有被告不適而押後。繼施德來周二（9日）晚確診新冠病毒，法官昨（10日）批准押後審訊；同案獲保釋被告黃碧雲今（11日）表示收到法庭通知，另一被告彭卓棋今亦確診，案件明繼續休庭，暫押至下周一（15日）續審。控方早前確認，本案主要證人已作供完畢，將應辯方要求傳召選舉主任及證物鏈相關警員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃碧雲今午（11日）約5時於 Facebook 發文表示，剛收到法庭通知，除施德來外，彭卓棋今亦確診，法庭宣佈星期五（12日）休庭。黃指，法庭內有百多人，空氣不流通，容易令疾病傳開，望能改善庭內換氣和通風系統。據記者觀察，彭卓棋開審以來均坐在施德來的旁邊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施德來周二（9日）早上新冠病毒快測陽性，原獲安排坐被告欄一角，與其他被告相隔，開庭後獲安排於延伸庭就坐，各被告亦有配戴口罩。其代表大律師黃廷光周三（10日）指施於周二晚求醫並確診新冠病毒，獲批4天病假，向法官申請押後審訊一天獲批，施的事務律師亦確診。法官着施若仍感不適，需及時通知法庭，案件今繼續休庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（9日）踏入審訊第55天。控方匿名證人「X先生」今在屏風後作供，表示曾與戴耀廷討論「35+計劃」目的，戴私下及公開均曾提及望迫特首下台。X並指，於2020年5月8日獲邀出席新界西協調會議，過程中以器材錄音及錄影，並於《國安法》實施後的同年9、10月匿名將檔案寄給警方。被問是否公開錄音，X答「係」，但指他將錄音筆放在袋裏，不清楚與會者是否知情，又指「現場係冇人提過係唔畀錄音呢樣嘢」；至於錄影，他指自己「全程都（將攝影器材）攞喺手度，有擺枱面，之後都有周圍影」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問為何錄音錄影，X否認是為了向警方舉報，並指因戴耀廷曾提及望以「35+」推翻政府，故望「了解吓」、「記錄返畀自己睇吓」、用作「研究」，指是直至《國安法》立法後才決定將檔案交予警方；而他匿名舉報，是想幫警方調查，但「唔想自己身分曝光咁麻煩」。庭上播放X拍攝的片段，戴曾稱新界東共同綱領字眼是「會運用」否決權，認為新界西可採用相同字眼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施德來確診獲安排於無人法庭就坐-官稱除寂寞外不會造成不公&quot;&gt;施德來確診獲安排於無人法庭就坐 官稱除「寂寞」外不會造成不公&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同案認罪被告、時任民主動力副召集人鍾錦麟昨完成作供，控方為下一名證人申請匿名令獲批，該名證人以「X先生」稱呼，獲准在屏風後作供及循特別通道出入法庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;甫開庭，代表施德來的大律師黃廷光便表示，施今早快速測試陽性，他已預約今晚看醫生，並獲安排坐在被告欄最左一側，與其他被告相隔，暫不會申請押後。所有被告今均配戴口罩，林卓廷入庭後除下口罩，撓手聳肩。法官陳慶偉提議，施德來可與律師到無人的一號延伸庭就坐，陳仲衡亦指除了寂寞外他的當事人不會蒙受不公，林卓廷笑着重複「loneliness，loneliness」。法庭其後小休讓施轉往另一法庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;x先生稱戴2019年區選後不同場合提35目的令特首下台&quot;&gt;「X先生」稱戴2019年區選後不同場合提「35+」目的令特首下台&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後傳召「X先生」作供，X於開庭前已到場，被屏風包圍，鄒家成一度問：「吓，喺度㗎啦？」，又雙手作望遠鏡狀。X同意，他沒有政治聯繫，而他早於2020年5月前已認識戴耀廷，並曾與戴討論「35+計劃」的目的，指戴在不同公開場合或私下均向他表示望得到立法會過半後否決財政預算案兩次，癱瘓政府和迫特首下台。X指，不記得戴第一次提及的確實時間，但有印象戴在2019年11月區選後「好有信心」並常提及，並在法官追問下指應是在2019年聖誕和2020年農曆新年之間。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於是什麼場合首次提及，X先生指「都係啲飯局嚟嘅，喺唔同嘅飯局，唔同嘅人，基本上都係啲泛民」。他指不記得誰安排飯局，而飯局上主要邀請「嗰啲泛民嗰啲人士」，戴耀廷經常分享「35+」的概念。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;X供稱，獲人民力量梁家聲邀請出席2020年5月8日的新界西協調會議，他約於2017、18年認識梁，記得梁提過有興趣參加新界西選舉。X指，他和梁當日出席會議，他有留到最後，期間分別用一支錄音筆和「一個細細個嘅攝錄器材」進行錄音和錄影，並在法官追問下指該器材並非電話，但大小與電話差不多，並可將檔案「直接過返電腦」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;X指，當晚有打開聲音和影片檔案，並在《國安法》實行之後的同年9、10月匿名向警方報案，並將檔案燒成一隻光碟寄給警方，包括2段錄音檔案和11段影片。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;x稱公開錄音惟不知其他人是否知悉-被告席爆笑&quot;&gt;X稱「公開錄音」惟不知其他人是否知悉 被告席爆笑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;X供稱，會議於元朗世宙地下的一個區議員辦事處舉行，有數十人出席，辦事處約有三分一個法庭大，有桌子放中間，與會者圍着桌子隨便坐，「我入到去都係隨便搵個位坐。」被問他是否坐近桌子，X指「算係近啦，可以擺到（錄影機）嘅」，控方再問他是否將攝影機放在桌子，X答「有時有，有時揸喺手」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰關注，需否知道片段是公開抑或隱蔽攝錄，羅天瑋指重點應在片段的內容，但李指「我想知道，你會問嗎？」，羅續指他會就此跟進，並問X錄音是否公開進行，X答「係」。李運騰問，因此所有與會者都知道他進行錄音？X指「我就唔知係咪佢哋知道，我就咁擺喺個袋度」，被告席隨即爆發笑聲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰再問，那X是否公開錄音，指「公開」的意思是他沒有嘗試隱瞞錄音的行為，他讓其他人知道他在做記錄，X回應「我記得現場係冇人提過係唔畀錄音呢樣嘢」。李再問，那其他人知道X當時在錄音嗎？X答：「我唔清楚」，林卓廷大聲冷笑。法官陳仲衡問那他有沒有告訴其他人？X答「冇」。李運騰再問，那其他與會者知道他在錄影嗎？X答：「我就唔知佢哋知唔知，不過我全程都攞喺手度、有擺枱面，之後都有周圍影嘅」，林卓廷和鄒家成等發笑，鄒一度舉起雙手模仿攝影機。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;x認選擇不同器材錄音錄影是經深思熟慮&quot;&gt;X認選擇不同器材錄音錄影是經深思熟慮&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，X為何要分別錄音和錄影，為何不只用手機拍攝有聲效的影片。X指因手機若收到訊息有機會暫停錄影，「同埋我唔想將敏感嘅資訊放喺我個人手機。」李問，因此X分開兩個儀器，是刻意（deliberate and conscious）的選擇，他是經過深思熟慮（thought it through）？X答：「係，當時我買嗰兩樣嘢就係為咗清楚睇返，有影像同聲音加深我嘅了解同記憶。」X同意，拍攝的片段也有聲音，李指那他也不需要另外錄音？惟X指「大家都知有時錄影同錄音嘅效果係唔同，錄音筆係會清晰好多」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;x不同意記錄為報案-指只用來研究了解戴耀廷稱搞35想推翻政府&quot;&gt;X不同意記錄為報案 指只用來研究、了解戴耀廷稱搞35+想「推翻政府」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指，控方尚未問X為何進行錄音錄影，指若他不發問，相信辯方也會問。羅天瑋指將會問到，並問X為何錄音錄影。X解釋，因戴在5月8日前於不同場合向他提過望以「35+」推翻政府，而梁家聲（人民力量成員）於5月初邀請他出席會議，「咁我覺得：如果直程討論35+嗰個會，係咪有機會可以做個記錄？所以我就去買咗攝錄器材，等自己有機會記錄返比自己睇吓。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡問，他想透過該些記錄做什麼？X答：「因為了解吓佢提過話搞呢個35+就想推翻政府啊嘛。」李運騰問，所以他出席會議並進行記錄的目的，是為了之後可以以他們來向警方報案？X指只同意前半的描述：「我係自己愛嚟研究，但唔認同係諗住嚟畀警方嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;x稱匿名舉報因想幫警方調查-惟不想身分曝光&quot;&gt;X稱匿名舉報因想幫警方調查 惟不想身分曝光&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;羅天瑋續問，戴此前就「35+」目的的描述，哪部分引起他的關注？X指，戴稱要控制初選人數入立法會，並可透過控制立法會，否決財政預算案，迫特首下台，「咁我就覺得應該就好有問題囉，就唔係為社區做嘢囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指，《國安法》於2020年7月1日才生效，而X自5月已有該些記錄，更曾出席會議知道與會者的發言，但他直至9、10月才向警方報案，為什麼？X指因他是在《國安法》立法後，才決定將檔案寄給警方。羅續問，X為何選擇匿名舉報，X指：「因為呢段嘢畀警方係想幫警方調查，唔想自己身分曝光咁麻煩。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方播新西片段鏡動晃動置枱底-戴耀廷提議新西協議跟隨新東用會運用&quot;&gt;控方播新西片段鏡動晃動置枱底 戴耀廷提議新西協議跟隨新東用「會運用」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，X拍攝的片段全長兩小時，但不會全部於庭上播放，只會播放其中6分鐘的片段，並展示錄音謄本予X確認，惟法官李運騰一度要求關閉螢幕，指顯示了證人的名字，被告席傳出笑聲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後播放數段片段，戴提及已完成了四區的協調，只餘下新西和超級區議會，並指各區除「五大訴求，缺一不可」外，共同綱領亦有「會運用」或「會積極運用」否決權，其中除新東用「會運用」，其他區都用「會積極運用」。庭上可見攝錄鏡頭不斷晃動，一時置於枱底，一時拍天花板，亦曾傾斜和反轉。X認出片中的戴耀廷和黃偉賢，二人均坐在拍片者的對面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;片段又顯示，戴提議新界西文件「就用返新界東嗰個字眼，改動最少㗎嘞，就只係剔除咗『積極』兩個字啫，就係『會運用』咁樣」，即明確意向是「會運用」，「我哋就簡簡單單就表達咗我哋立場。」他又提及否決財政預算案是令解散立法會出現「最緊要」一步，「如果否決財政預算案呢，我哋先至會行到去下一步」，望協議能訂明「會運用《基本法》賦予立法會的權力」否決財政預算案達到「五大訴求」，以爭取「特赦、懲戒警暴同埋重啟政改」。播放片段時，鄒家成一度雙手掩面，搖頭苦笑。控方其後表示已完成主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/82atf5H.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（9日）踏入審訊第55天。供稱於新西協調會議錄音和錄影、《國安法》生效後交予警方的控方匿名證人「X先生」接受辯方盤問，同意沒有問准與會者便進行拍攝，但不覺得是侵犯他人私隱，自言「我就冇話唔想畀人知」、亦「唔係所謂秘密（拍攝）」，指當時「我係好光明正大咁揸住部機周圍影」。被問是否民主派支持者，X指「我有時支持、有時唔支持，我點答呢咁？」，並承認初選舉行數年前，曾任建制派政黨的議員助理，但否認有第三方要求他錄影新西會議、亦否認提供資料有收取報酬，強調記錄是「純粹諗住畀我自己去了解」戴耀廷的計劃有否違法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;X又同意，於2021年4月和5月錄取的首兩份供詞均「唔敢講、唔敢認」自己是攝錄並交新西會議片段予警方的人，但因今年年初知悉身分曝光，遂於本年2月底錄取口供時告知警方。被問未來會否因此獲得報償，X稱：「政府會唔會畀個好市民獎我，我唔知喎。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;稱戴耀廷提及推翻政府-x盤問下指是對戴說法的理解&quot;&gt;稱戴耀廷提及「推翻政府」 X盤問下指是對戴說法的理解&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方匿名證人「X先生」今早供稱，獲人民力量梁家聲邀請出席新西協調會議，期間進行錄音及錄影，並於2020年9、10月匿名將檔案交給警方，解釋望記錄作「研究」。X完成主問後，接受代表鄭達鴻和梁國雄的大律師黃宇逸盤問，同意他並非「35+計劃」的組織者和參與者，而他稱戴曾在不同場合提及「35+」目的時，並不記得趙家賢、區諾軒和鍾錦麟在場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/HNPhlwe.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
▲ 鄭達鴻（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;X在主問供稱，戴耀廷在5月8日前向他提過望以「35+」推翻政府。代表何啟明的大律師阮偉明指，X在2021年4月29日和5月4日的第一和第二份供詞均沒有如此提及，X指「如果你話口供有寫嘅字眼，可能當時冇提到啦」。阮續指，戴其實沒有提過「推翻政府」，X回應，戴在「咁多次傾偈」均提到迫特首下台，「我嘅理解就係覺得迫特首落台就係推翻政府。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/WPXv4DG.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;x同意首兩次錄口供沒告知警方&quot;&gt;X同意首兩次錄口供沒告知警方&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後由代表林卓廷和黃碧雲的大律師沈士文盤問。X同意，兩次供詞都是警方主動聯絡他錄取，他願向警方講述事件，但沒告知警方他曾寄出新西會議的錄音和片段。沈續指，第二次錄口供時，警方曾向X播放該兩段錄音及11段片段，播畢後X沒告知警方自己就是攝錄者，並稱相信片段是有關他有出席的5月8日會議情況，而錄音令他記起會上情況也反映會上內容。X確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;x同意片段晃動-解釋我唔係一個專業嘅攝錄人士&quot;&gt;X同意片段晃動 解釋「我唔係一個專業嘅攝錄人士」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;X同意，片段顯示兩名主持戴耀廷和時任元朗區議會主席黃偉賢均坐在一張枱前，與會者則在枱對面，而片段有時拍天花板、有時拍枱底，而且「郁來郁去（shaky）」。沈續指，片段亦「非常不穩定」，X答「我唔知係咪穩定，因為我係揸住喺手度，我當時冇話特意影邊個或者點樣影，純粹諗住做個記錄」，其後同意片段大部分時間鏡頭也晃動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈續指，X稱望拍片以進行「研究」，他不想片段穩定地拍攝嗎？X答：「我係想希望（穩定），但我唔係一個專業嘅攝錄人士」。李運騰問，X是否不想其他人知道他在錄影？X答：「我就冇話唔想畀人知，當時我攞住部機機，我覺得都算係相對大方啦，就周圍影，擺枱面。」林卓廷面露驚訝，張開嘴巴發出「吓」聲，鄒家成等亦發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;x同意沒問准拍攝-官問是否不想人知-x自言相對大方&quot;&gt;X同意沒問准拍攝 官問是否不想人知 X自言「相對大方」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈再問X是否想片段穩定，X指沒留意是否穩定，僅指他將攝錄器材「揸住喺手度」。沈指當然知道，第三度問他是否想片段穩定？X再答：「我當然係希望想穩定啦，但我冇咁嘅技術去做啊嘛。」沈續問，整個會議期間，X是否沒問組織者或與會者的准許拍攝他們，X指「當時我冇問過，但現場都冇人講呢個唔可以拍攝，現場都有好多人攞住部電話周圍」。李運騰着他直接回答問題，X續答「冇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;x稱錄影後重複看兩三次了解戴耀廷有否違法-上網找尋法律但搵唔到&quot;&gt;X稱錄影後重複看兩三次了解戴耀廷有否違法 上網找尋法律但「搵唔到」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就X稱記錄會議內容是為了「研究」，沈士文問，那自5月8日會議至他於9、10月將檔案交警方前，他為這個「研究」做了什麼？X指「我有重複聽同埋睇嗰啲片同錄音啦」，指「應該起碼睇過兩三次」。李運騰問X指的「研究」是什麼意思，X指戴當時提及否決預算案迫特首落台，故想「了解清楚佢（戴耀廷）咁樣做會唔會有問題」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，除了重複聽和看錄音和錄影，X還做了什麼去了解，X指他並非法律人士，「我就想了解例如睇吓啲法律呀，搵吓啲唔識嘅嘢」，並指當時有政府人士稱初選或違法，他覺得可能真的有問題，加上《國安法》通過，就決定將片段寄出。李指X只是逃避問題、重複所說的話，又指問題簡單，就是X還做了什麼「研究」。X重申有上網找尋相關法律，「但係就唔識呢啲嘢，就搵唔到。」李續向沈指，根據證人回答的方式，不認為能繼續問到什麼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;X續同意，他沒有修讀過政治或法律的課程。沈問，那當他稱為了「研究」而記錄會議時，他是要進行任何有關香港政治狀況的研究嗎？X答：「冇，純粹諗住畀我自己去了解吓啫。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;供詞稱2020年初買器材望日後研究-x否認當時未知新西會議日期&quot;&gt;供詞稱2020年初買器材望日後研究 X否認當時未知新西會議日期&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;X在盤問下同意，戴耀廷2019年尾至2020年初首次向他提及「35+」時，他已懷疑可能違法。沈問因此在2020年初，他已購買錄音和錄影的器材？X指「應該就唔係」。沈續展示X於2023年2月21日，即案件開審後第三周所錄取的第3份供詞，交代涉案的11段片段及兩段錄音均是由他在5月8日新西會議拍攝及錄音，並指2020年初得知戴望透過民主派初選，在立法會否決財政預算案，最終令特首下台，「所以當時我懷疑今次民主派初選係可能會觸犯法例，於是我就喺2020年初就買咗一啲錄影錄音嘅器材，希望第日有機會錄低有關搞初選嘅嘢嚟畀自己研究。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈問，X是指自己於2020年初買器材？X答「可以咁講」，並在法官追問下指肯定是在5月會議之前，但確實日期不記得。沈問，X買器材時是否尚未定下新西會議日期，惟X指當時已知道，並由梁家聲邀請出席。沈指若事實如此，則他會向警方表明他是為了記錄新西會議而買器材。X解釋當時這樣說是因為就當天會議，「可以有機會去，可以有機會唔去」，不同意辯方指他買器材時並不知道將有新西會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈指，X是指當他懷疑「35+」犯法、並希望記錄作研究時，梁家聲「純粹巧合（pure coincidence）」地邀請他出席新西會議？X答：「係」，並指對被邀請「冇話高唔高興」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;x稱沒告知梁家聲攝錄會議-因不了解初選有否違法&quot;&gt;X稱沒告知梁家聲攝錄會議 因不了解初選有否違法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文續問，X打算攝錄會議作「研究」，有否告訴他的「朋友」梁家聲，X指：「唔認為需要，點解要同佢講？」李運騰問，他不擔心梁無意中參與有問題的討論？X指他認為可能有問題，但不是完全了解。李續問事實上梁是否X的朋友，X指與梁在2017、2018年在地區認識，平時地區活動有交流，可說是「認識嘅人（acquaintance）」，平時「有出嚟食吓飯傾吓偈」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡指，問題其實是以X與梁的關係，他會否就懷疑犯法的事警告梁？X重申因為不肯定有否犯法，故沒有告訴他。沈最後再問X當時是否視梁為朋友，李運騰補充朋友的意思是他會關心的人，X說：「咁呀……只可以話唔算囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問梁邀請X出席時，是否知道X無興趣參選，X表示「我由頭到尾都冇講話我有興趣，係佢話佢有興趣，邀請我跟去聽吓」，而他會前已估計和懷疑計劃違法。沈再次問，即使如此，他也沒告知梁他認為初選可能違法？X指「咁我都唔會將我懷疑、都唔確定嘅嘢同人講㗎嘛」，並在法官追問下答「冇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;x指有時支持有時唔支持民主派-曾任建制派議員議助&quot;&gt;X指「有時支持、有時唔支持」民主派 曾任建制派議員議助&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈其後問到X的政治立場，問他在新西會議舉行時是否視自己為泛民主派的支持者。X指「我唔認為我係支持有任何派別嘅」，因他從無參與任何政黨，並在沈追問下指，「如果一定話係咪支持民主派，咁我有時支持、有時唔支持，我點答呢咁？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指，有趣的是他有出席一些泛民人士的飯局，問他是否也有出席建制派飯局，X指「基本上我唔會話特別係支持泛民或者建制」，只是想做地區工作，鄒家成、余慧明等發笑。沈其後問及X此前的工作背景，陳慶偉質疑不相關和不重要，沈指他是在建立案情。X其後同意，於案發數年前曾任建制派政黨的議員助理一段時間，並自行辭職，認識建制派之餘也「識到好多你所謂嘅『民主派』」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈欲繼續就相關背景發問，惟陳慶偉質疑與案無關。沈重申欲質疑證人可信性，指其政治聯繫會影響他供稱錄影新西會議原因的可信性，又指X不僅將所拍攝的片段呈堂，亦有就戴耀廷的說法作供，故就此發問。惟陳慶偉指，除了指戴提過「推翻政府」外，X其他有關戴的證供，法庭已有其他證據；李運騰亦指，他理解X的角色只是協助將證物呈堂。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;x稱不覺得未經批准錄影是侵犯他人私隱&quot;&gt;X稱不覺得未經批准錄影是侵犯他人私隱&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文在休庭後，表示已完成盤問。代表施德來的大律師黃廷光續問，X是否認為沒有得到他人許可下錄影是侵犯他們的私隱？X答：「唔覺得。」黃再向X指出，他錄影是為了「研究」以外的目的，惟法官指已問過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;x否認有第三方要求攝錄新西會議指器材去年已壞咗抌咗&quot;&gt;X否認有第三方要求攝錄新西會議、指器材去年已「壞咗，抌咗」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後到代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 盤問。被問與戴耀廷曾出席多少次飯局，X指不確定，大概約數個，約一至兩個月舉行一次，「主要都係傾吓分享吓當時嗰個政治」，但他沒被要求分享。Beel 問那他為何在場？X指「咁有啲朋友邀請我去」，但不記得是誰，也不記得除戴耀廷以外出席的人士，僅稱「主要係圍繞住一啲泛民主派嘅人士」。Beel 問，這些飯局是否只是他的幻想？X答：「點解要幻想，呢個係事實嚟㗎喎。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就2021年4月的首份口供，被問是什麼情況下錄取，X指是「警方突然上我屋企」，指「有單案件需要我協助調查」，而警方事前沒聯絡他。Beel 續問，是否有第三方要求他攝錄新西會議？X指沒有，同意他是自主行事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 又問及該兩個攝錄器材現時去向，X指「壞咗，抌咗」，余慧明驚訝做口型「嘩」。X在追問下指於2022年丟棄，不記得確實日子，又指曾於一些活動用過，「就覺得係有問題、唔用得，所以就抌咗。」Beel 問為何想記錄活動，X指「既然我買咗個筆就無謂嘥咗」，林卓廷大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;x稱相信第二次會議內容差不多-故沒有再攝錄&quot;&gt;X稱相信第二次會議內容差不多 故沒有再攝錄&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續指，X有出席新界西5月於旺角的第二次會議，X先指不太記得、但肯定沒有，後在法官追問下又指印象中5月8日後有出席另一個會議，內容大概都與初選有關，「但確實係咪新界西，我就唔肯定啦，因為冇記錄」，林卓廷說「吓」。Beel 指，X口供曾提及該次會議與會者與5月8日差不多，但多了區諾軒，X指「嗰陣時份口供可能係咁寫」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，該會議與初選有關，X當時是否有興趣繼續做他的「研究」？X指當時錄了第一次，「之後睇返個畫面係好唔穩定，自己都頭暈，講真」，李指那無阻他錄音，X指「咁既然第一次錄咗，我相信內容都差唔多」，故沒有錄多次，同意沒有錄第二次是他自主的決定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;x稱檢視片段後認為戴有機會違法-仍出席第二次會議因諗住聽清楚&quot;&gt;X稱檢視片段後認為戴有機會違法 仍出席第二次會議因「諗住聽清楚」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就X的攝錄器材，他同意沒有螢幕，需傳送到電腦才能觀看。Beel 問是否不像相機，X答：「我覺得似啦，因為有鏡頭、有開關，點解唔似呢？」，並指是如手機的大小。Beel 問，該攝錄機是否偽裝（disguise）成其他東西的間諜器材，惟李運騰質疑是否需要。Beel 續問，X當時買了兩個器材分別錄音和錄影，是否想在其中一個不能用時，還有另一個備份。X重申錄音筆效果比錄影好，而購買時售貨員亦指錄音筆的錄音效果較好。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問首次會議是否知道正錄取敏感的資料，並相信有罪行將發生，X指「我都講咗我係懷疑囉」，「我唔係一個法律專業人士，我都係估計啫」，並確認會議翌日曾檢視錄取內容。被問當時是否認為有刑事成分，他指「我都係唔了解、唔認識，所以先諗住睇多幾次、聽多幾次了解吓」，而檢視過後，就覺得「可能佢（戴耀廷）咁搞就有機會違反法律」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問既然如此，為何仍出席第二次會議？X重申當時懷疑犯法，故「諗住聽清楚」，而第二次會後「結論都係懷疑、估計（犯法）」。Beel 問既然有此懷疑，為何不立即將檔案發給警方，X指因戴耀廷指自己是「法律專家」，當時指不會違法；而他其後再發給警方，是因《國安法》通過，「有好多啲官話呢樣嘢係違法呀嘛。」Beel 問是什麼違法，X答：「初選。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;x指今年年初被曝光才告知警方他是攝錄者稱光明正大揸住部機周圍影&quot;&gt;X指今年年初被曝光才告知警方他是攝錄者、稱「光明正大揸住部機周圍影」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，X向警方報案時是否知道警方正進行調查，X指他不知道，「不過我估佢應該有（調查）啩，見通過咗個法律。」X同意，在首兩次錄口供時他都「唔敢講、唔敢認」他是拍攝並向警方發送片段的人，他是在今年年初，「我上網見到我畀人曝光出嚟」，才告知警方。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續指，X是秘密地攝錄會議，不想被其他人得知，X答：「頭先我都講過我唔係所謂秘密，我係好光明正大咁揸住部機周圍影。」Beel 最後問，X提供資料有否報酬，X指沒有，Beel 追問那他未來會否有報償（reward），傳譯主任譯為「獎項」，X回應：「政府會唔會畀個好市民獎我，我唔知喎」，多名被告發笑。Beel 笑說或者不會，並指沒有盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;吳政亨、余慧明、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、劉偉聰、陳志全、鄒家成和李予信也沒有盤問，控方沒有覆問。控方最後為X申請證人費，陳仲衡指這並非酬勞，李運騰並解釋任何市民出庭作證人可得到證人費。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方表示，下一名證人是因應何桂藍要求而傳召的選舉主任。案件明早續。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（8日）踏入審訊第54天。時任民主動力副召集人鍾錦麟接受辯方盤問，同意戴耀廷望以「35+」要求政府回應「五大訴求」。被問是否並非無論如何都會「一刀切」無差別否決預算案，鍾表示「為了爭取五大訴求而否決預算案」是「比較貼近實際情況」。鍾亦指，估計民主派較難取得「35+」，指2019年區議會民主派大勝純粹因為單議席單票制，難以簡單推斷2020年立法會選舉也能大勝，自言「我個人睇得保守啲」。法官指這只是鍾的看法，而非戴耀廷看法，鍾形容「佢（戴耀廷）係超級大好友」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，鍾上周稱何桂藍於新東會議自介為「立場姐姐」，何兩度大叫「肯定冇」。鍾今再解釋當時戴耀廷介紹何為「立場姐姐」，何語帶無奈表示大家叫她做「立場姐姐」。在被告席的何擺手和做口型示意她沒有。鍾錦麟今作供完畢，法官批准控方為下一名控方證人申請匿名令，他將以「X先生」稱呼，並獲准在屏風後作供及以特別通道出入法庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾稱民動2月已有共識協助初選眾籌趙家贀退出前不曾提原因&quot;&gt;鍾稱民動2月已有共識協助初選眾籌、趙家贀退出前不曾提原因&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾錦麟繼續接受代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 盤問。鍾同意，於2020年2月與戴耀廷的會面，戴提及民主動力有銀行戶口可協助籌款。被問民動是否於同年5月才正式承辦眾籌，鍾指在2月的會面上已有共識民動可在這方面協助。鍾又同意，趙家賢在6月9日初選記者會後曾表示眾籌進度不理想，找職員草擬 Facebook 帖文宣傳，亦着鍾幫忙轉發，但鍾不清楚帖文由誰所撰，發文前亦沒有細看，「見到入面有關於眾籌嘅詳情我就轉發咗啦」，趙亦沒提過有審批過帖文。此前趙曾就該帖文出現「光復議會」和「對抗暴政」向法官認錯，指帖文由職員所撰，「我冇做好謹慎責任嘅角色。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 亦展示民主動力執委會2019年10月的會議紀錄，提及趙家賢匯報因民動及戴耀廷受國務院及港澳辦嚴厲譴責，民動為免繼續被打壓而退出協調工作。法官早前曾質疑趙沒有提到民動被「騎劫」，趙指雖文字紀錄沒有，但有向執委會提及。Beel 問，會議紀錄有關民動退出的原因是否準確，鍾稱「喺正式退出之前，趙家賢冇同我提出過」，故未能評論哪個原因較重要或不重要，只能確定上述理由是趙在初選活動中的「重要關注」。鍾亦不記得趙會上有提及其他退出的原因。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾同意以往議員反對撥款無後果相信建制媒體報導或影響選舉主任&quot;&gt;鍾同意以往議員反對撥款無後果、相信建制媒體報導或影響選舉主任&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾錦麟在盤問下同意，以往立法會均有議員對撥款條例草案投反對票。Beel 問反對後有否引起迴響（repercussion）？鍾稱「投完個反應唔大嘅」，因他們並非立法會大多數，即使反對撥款條例草案，「本身就冇特別大去影響到政府運作」；而反應較大是視乎審議有否拉布，最大反應一次則是約於2009至2011年間，撥款條例草案正式表決前，臨時撥款被立法會否決。鍾同意，以往議員反對預算案並沒有問題或後果（ramification）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾上周供稱，新東首次會議後曾向戴表達無差別否決預算案或致DQ。他同意因親建制媒體對戴耀廷文章、初選和否決預算案作批評，而他們的報導反映中央政府看法，故當時有此擔心。Beel 續問，鍾是否相信這些文章會對選舉主任產生影響？控方一度指證人未能回答，但法官指是問及他個人的看法，鍾表示同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;被問是否一刀切無差別否決-鍾稱為爭五大訴求否決較貼近實際情況&quot;&gt;被問是否一刀切無差別否決 鍾稱為爭五大訴求否決「較貼近實際情況」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾續同意，「35+計劃」是戴耀廷提出的願景，而戴認為民主派若立會過半，便可向政府就民主派提出的議題包括「五大訴求，缺一不可」施壓。Beel 指五大訴求曾經改變，鍾回應「都喺同一個框架入面」，並同意其中一項訴求是撤回《逃犯條例》，其後已撤回，而特首下台的訴求被爭取雙普選取代。Beel 指，故戴是希望透過「35+」，要求政府回應五大訴求，否則會反對政府議案，尤其是預算案？鍾認同。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 再問，所以當時並非無論如何，都會一刀切無差別否決預算案（not a blanket indiscriminately vote against the budget come what may）？鍾指，「我反而覺得你原先嘅講法，為咗爭取五大訴求而去否決預算案，呢個係比較貼近個實際情況」，又指：「當然我唔能夠講一個平行時空，五大訴求如果得到咩程度嘅回應，而呢個35+選出嚟嘅議員嘅取態又有啲咩唔同，我呢個唔能夠講得到。」陳慶偉問，故是視乎每名初選參與者？鍾指「我只可以講我理解囉」，同意就其他參與者的取態不能回答。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾稱對能否獲35較保守-惟指戴耀廷是超級大好友&quot;&gt;鍾稱對能否獲「35+」較保守 惟指戴耀廷是「超級大好友」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，鍾當時認為民主派是否不可能在2020年9月的立法會換屆選舉取得「35+」，鍾稱「我當時嘅估計係較困難」，指因當時大家是基於區議會「單議席單票制」去評估選情，但據他在2019年區選的經驗，當時反對民主派的票數亦創新高。法官李運騰指他不明白，鍾續解釋表面上民主派當年獲「壓倒性勝利」，純粹因為是單議席單票制，但得票率其實沒有大改變，「所以唔能夠好簡單就去下一個結論，當時嘅立法會選舉亦都一樣民主派會大勝。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉指是因為立法會採取「比例代表制」，鍾同意，並指有功能組別如飲食界，的確在2019年社會事件中生意受到影響，「係咪咁簡單就話2019年嘅選舉結果，就推斷2020年嘅立法會選舉能夠大勝呢？我個人睇得保守啲。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡指，這只是鍾的看法，明顯不是戴耀廷的看法。鍾回應「佢（戴耀廷）係超級大好友」（即指戴對此很樂觀），林卓廷等被告發笑，鍾並指沒有向戴表達過其較保守或悲觀的看法。李運騰問，那新東首次會議上有沒有與會者關注「35+」成功的機會？鍾指沒有，因新界東在2016年立會換屆選舉已取得6席，「喺新界東攞返6席本身就唔係太難嘅」，他擔心的是其他區或功能組別，同意即使地方選區取得23席，功能組別仍需13席才能過半。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾指不知悉初選後有計劃協調民主派行動&quot;&gt;鍾指不知悉初選後有計劃協調民主派行動&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，由於功能組別要考慮生意利益，故相信所有功能組別議員都會否決預算案是「不切實際」的？鍾答「我冇考慮過呢個問題」，但認同據其區議會經驗，成員間有很多內鬥（in-house fighting）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問，那鍾是否知道當時有沒有計劃或制度在初選之後，會就勝出的參選人作協調，統一他們投票？鍾指過往立法會民主派議員有「飯盒會」，其後正名為「民主派會議」，「但我唔肯定如果2020年嘅立法會選舉都係咁樣去選出一班民主派議員嘅話，呢個飯盒會仲會唔會運作到。」李運騰指不是問以往，而是問有沒有將來的計劃，鍾表示不知悉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾稱戴耀廷介紹何桂藍為立場姐姐-何語帶無奈指大家叫她做立場姐姐&quot;&gt;鍾稱戴耀廷介紹何桂藍為「立場姐姐」 何語帶無奈指大家叫她做「立場姐姐」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾錦麟上周五指何桂藍於4月14日的新東首次會議自我介紹為「立場姐姐」，何兩度大叫「肯定冇！」。Beel 今向鍾指出，鍾可能聽過別人稱她為「立場姐姐」，但何當天會上並沒有這樣介紹自己。此時何背靠牆雙手捧起文件微笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾回應：「我嘗試記返當時嘅對話係點樣啦，戴耀廷介紹何桂藍係『立場姐姐』，之後何桂藍稱呼自己做何桂藍，跟住佢語帶無奈話即係大家叫我做『立場姐姐』」，何一度掩面發笑，並擺手搖頭，頻做口型指她並沒有。法官陳仲衡指，此問題無助辯方案情，Beel 表示明白，但指其當事人對此有強烈感受（strong feeling），法官陳慶偉表示明白。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾稱首次新東會議就舉行初選及目標議席61達共識-惟無進行投票&quot;&gt;鍾稱首次新東會議就舉行初選及目標議席「6+1」達共識 惟無進行投票&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾同意，首次新東會議就進行初選有共識。Beel 問如何得悉有共識，鍾指經討論後，所有原本提倡「棄選」方案的參與者也接受了「初選」方案，故認為已達成共識，並指戴耀廷應有講過一次「大家係有共識用初選方案」，但不太肯定，而會上並沒有就此進行投票。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾亦供稱，會上就目標議席達成共識，指隨着決定用初選方案，亦決定會選出多少人去報名參加正式選舉，共識就是「6+1」，但同樣沒進行投票。Beel 問他肯定不是稍後再決定？鍾指「我理解係拍咗板㗎啦」，並指早前稱向戴就新東文件初稿提出異議，正是就「6+1」的問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾續指，「如果法庭好關心呢個問題呢，我可以提供多一項資料提供畀法庭去參考嘅」，指初選完結後、正式選舉報名前，新東參選人曾爭拗新東目標議席究竟是6還是7，而最後戴指「6同埋7都唔係正確嘅講法，正確嘅講法係6+1，即係7隊人會去報名，但係最後一隊要係選情要比預期順利先至開展選舉工程」。鍾指，戴是透過 WhatsApp 提及上述說法，而當時新東排第7的是范國威。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾稱沒印象會上有港獨破壞一國兩制言論&quot;&gt;鍾稱沒印象會上有港獨、破壞一國兩制言論&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾同意，無論共識如何，都是由戴耀廷的想法所帶動（driven by what Benny Tai wanted）；而鍾對DQ的問題較敏感，認為港獨、破壞一國兩制等言論均可能引致DQ，但沒印象會上曾聽過相關發言。Beel 表示已完成盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉其後指，知道協調會議達成4項共識，除舉行初選和目標議席數量外，還有替補機制和舉行選舉論壇，問會上是否沒有就此投票。鍾同意，指就替補機制和選舉論壇的共識，「我形容係冇爭議嘅」，並補充會上的確有人對自己能否成功「入閘」較悲觀，但對替補機制無爭議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;會議紀錄顯示柯耀林新東第二次會議當晚正開區議會會議&quot;&gt;會議紀錄顯示柯耀林新東第二次會議當晚正開區議會會議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表柯耀林的大律師唐樂山其後就柯出席新東會議的情況發問。鍾上周供稱，因西貢區議會超時而缺席5月5日的新東第二次協調會議，鍾確認柯同屬西貢區議員。辯方展示當天的西貢區議會會議紀錄，顯示鍾於上午9時30分出席，下午10時40分離席，鍾確認；紀錄亦顯示柯耀林於上午9時33分出席，下午10時40分離席，鍾稱沒有獨立記憶，只記得柯有出席會議，但不記得其離席時間和是否有全程出席，但同意不會質疑會議紀錄的真實性。他亦不記得柯耀林有否出席首次新東會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於陳志全、鄒家成、和李予信均沒有盤問，控方亦沒有覆問。鍾完成作供，離開時一度望向旁聽席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方為證人申請匿名令獲批-指證人擔心遭受網絡欺凌&quot;&gt;控方為證人申請匿名令獲批 指證人擔心遭受網絡欺凌&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方早前欲就其中一名控方證人申請匿名令，今表示辯方沒反對，但有部分被告就匿名令範圍提出修訂。代表李予信的大律師關文渭表示，望匿名令不適用於在公共領域（public domain）而非於庭上獲得的資料。法官質疑若批准申請，會有違匿名令想進一步保護證人的原意。關則回應，相關資料在公共領域已存在，不認為法庭能阻止資訊進一步傳播，法庭只能限制庭上的資料。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉指，望保護證人被有不可告人動機（ulterior motive）的人騷擾或威嚇；法官李運騰亦指，證人擔心披露他在庭上作供或遭受網絡欺凌，認為法庭要處理其關注，並在公平審訊和保護證人之間取得平衡。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉終表示，考慮到關大狀的修訂會令整個匿名令失去保護證人的原意，故拒絕其申請，並批准證人的匿名令，下令各方以「X先生」稱呼他，並禁止任何人包括被告、法律代表和傳媒，披露任何可令公眾識別其身分的資料，如名字、相片、出生日期等；證人獲准在屏風後作供，及經特別通道出入法庭。陳另指任何人若違反命令，有機會犯藐視法庭，可被判監或罰款。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;據庭上作供次序，「X先生」是繼區諾軒、趙家賢和鍾錦麟後的第四名控方證人。據了解，早前第四名從犯證人林景楠將不會出庭作供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方讀出3被告修訂同意事實&quot;&gt;控方讀出3被告修訂同意事實&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後讀出林卓廷和黃碧雲，以及何桂藍的修訂同意事實。三人早前的同意事實均較其餘13名被告為少，其中林卓廷和黃碧雲僅同意與他們本人相關的事實，何桂藍則不包括戴耀廷的相關證物、抗爭派記者會等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;林卓廷和黃碧雲的修訂同意事實，新增部分其他被告早前同意的事項，包括戴耀廷和吳政亨的文章和片段、趙家賢被搜得的手機資料和民主動力相關文件、各被告發布「墨落無悔」的帖文及其他競選帖文和影片、其他被告的提名表格和按金收據、抗爭派記者會等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於何桂藍的修訂同意事實，則新增時任新界東地區直選選舉主任楊蕙心向何桂藍發信，要求就其問題提供書面回覆，何在回覆後，於2020年7月31日被通知提名無效。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件押至明早續審。&lt;/p&gt;

Nuclear threats are rising, and U.S. allies are increasingly concerned about the credibility of U.S. security guarantees. Russia is issuing veiled threats to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, China is drastically increasing the size and diversity of its nuclear arsenal, North Korea is fielding more advanced nuclear weapons capabilities, and Iran is developing a high degree of nuclear latency.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To explore these issues, the CSIS Project on Nuclear Issues leveraged an “alternative futures” methodology to unpack how key drivers might affect the U.S. extended deterrence mission in the next 10 years. In nearly all future scenarios this project explored, the United States suffers a credibility problem. It will be increasingly difficult to assure allies that the United States is prepared to employ U.S. nuclear weapons in defending their vital interests if necessary. It will require a shift in the way future administrations consult, plan, train, and operate with allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In nearly all future scenarios this project explored, the United States suffers a credibility problem.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any nuclear future, the United States’ best asset will be its allies — if it is able to maintain alliance cohesion. Allies are a center of gravity for the United States, as well as a force multiplier. The research scenarios consider changes in adversary capabilities, but in all scenarios, a cohesive and confident alliance network backed by credible extended deterrence guarantees U.S. strategic interests. Since a strong alliance network is the best weapon against Russian and Chinese aggression and risk manipulation, this report’s recommendations focus on strengthening alliance cohesion through a combination of sustained investment in the nuclear enterprise, developing capabilities to manage nuclear risks, improving communication and consultation with allies, and strengthening the United States’ overall credibility as a strategic partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;findings-summary&quot;&gt;Findings Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project set out to answer three main questions: (1) What are the strategic drivers that will shape the U.S. extended deterrence mission over the next 10 years, and how might those drivers interact to produce different outcomes, or “futures”? (2) How will U.S. concepts of integrated deterrence shape the extended deterrence mission and how might weighting various integrated deterrence objectives differently affect key elements of U.S. extended deterrence (e.g., treaty commitments, nuclear policy, forward-deployed nuclear forces, nuclear sharing and consultation arrangements, allied conventional capabilities, U.S. forces deployed abroad, and nonproliferation)? (3) What are the signposts and indicators that one of these potential futures may be more likely?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drivers:&lt;/strong&gt; The study found that adversary nuclear capabilities and alliance cohesion would be the main strategic driver of the U.S. extended deterrence mission for the next decade. Adversary nuclear capabilities will be impacted by a variety of factors, including advances in nonnuclear technologies, regional ambitions, and internal factors such as economic constraints. One important variable will be whether and to what extent adversaries collude with each other. Alliance cohesion and synchronization will be another key strategic driver and will be influenced by external threat perceptions, internal political pressures, the credibility of U.S. security guarantees, and allies’ interpretation of the concept of integrated deterrence, among other factors. This report defines “synchronization challenges” among allies as a combination of political and operational factors, such as competition among allies for U.S. assurances and capabilities, a lack of interoperability at the technical level, and the overarching absence of shared strategic interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a risk that allies perceive integrated deterrence as putting them in competition for U.S. attention and resources, or that integrated deterrence somehow signals a move away from “nuclear” deterrence. Additionally, the study found allies’ perceptions of U.S. domestic politics will influence alliance cohesion and U.S. credibility. Continued U.S. polarization, a lack of sustained investment in the nuclear enterprise, or fluctuations in attitudes toward the allies could undermine U.S. extended deterrence efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrated Deterrence:&lt;/strong&gt; Concepts of integrated deterrence will have at least three important implications for extended deterrence. First, based on all of the project scenarios, the United States will need to continue to rely on nuclear weapons for extended deterrence purposes, but it will also need to keep open the possibility of shifting investment to advanced nonnuclear capabilities and competing with Russia and China in different domains. This will require a more flexible, agile, and responsive defense investment process than currently exists. Second, the United States will need to take a more holistic approach to assuring allies in both Europe and Asia to prevent them from competing with each other for U.S. guarantees and resources. In general, the study found that the United States could improve its messaging to allies, particularly through a more robust consultation process. Finally, the study found that arms control and nonproliferation efforts are possible in all the alternative future scenarios; however, these agreements will look very different depending on adversary capabilities and alliance cohesion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Signposts:&lt;/strong&gt; The study identified a variety of signposts for each scenario. These include adversaries’ investments in nuclear and nonnuclear capabilities, allies’ requests for U.S. assets or assurances, allied and adversarial interest in arms control and risk reduction measures, and political shifts within allies’ governments. The relationship between adversaries may also signal a shifting strategic landscape, depending on whether they are working in loose coordination or a more formal cooperation. One of the most prominent signposts will be U.S. investment in the nuclear enterprise and political commitment to alliances. These signals from Washington will heavily influence the extended deterrence mission, adversaries’ willingness to engage in nuclear adventurism and manipulate strategic risks, and allies’ confidence in U.S. security guarantees and willingness to cooperate — rather than compete — with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study resulted in three overarching findings and recommendations for U.S. decisionmakers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, in order to compete in the nuclear future, the United States must sustain investment in the nuclear enterprise while also competing in nonnuclear technologies. This will require a more flexible, agile, and responsive defense investment process than currently exists.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, alliance cohesion will be increasingly difficult in all nuclear futures but is essential for a successful extended deterrence mission.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third, the United States can strengthen alliance cohesion not only through sustained investment in nuclear capabilities, but also by committing publicly and repeatedly to the enduring value of alliances, tailoring messages to its allies, and revamping consultation and operational planning processes with allies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In order to compete in the nuclear future, the United States must sustain investment in the nuclear enterprise while also competing in nonnuclear technologies. This will require a more flexible, agile, and responsive defense investment process than currently exists.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand future U.S. extended deterrence requirements, PONI leveraged an alternative futures methodology for this project. Over the course of three workshops, PONI convened a diverse group of regional and functional experts to identify key trends and drivers that will shape the U.S. extended deterrence mission and to develop and evaluate four future scenarios that highlight outcomes, risks, and opportunities for U.S. policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first workshop, senior experts identified 11 key trends that will shape the future of the U.S. extended deterrence mission. The project team categorized these trends based on the “three Cs” of deterrence: capability, credibility, and communication — though some of the factors overlap between categories or do not neatly fit into one bucket. These trends are listed below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;capability&quot;&gt;CAPABILITY&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Growth and diversification of nuclear arsenals, both qualitatively and quantitatively&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Increased range and accuracy of adversary weapons systems, including nonnuclear capabilities, which threaten U.S. and allied assets&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Expanded competition — and in some cases conflict — across multiple domains, including space and cyber&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) Increased transparency through social media platforms and open-source data, magnifying the ability to cause social disruption and spread misinformation and disinformation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;credibility&quot;&gt;CREDIBILITY&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) Synchronization and credibility challenges that cause logistical and political stress on alliance networks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6) Increased signaling and demand by allies and partners for U.S. capabilities and exports, including weapons sales, which stress U.S. weapons production infrastructure and political support for weapons production&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7) Increased demand by allies and partners for forward-deployed U.S. strategic assets in a tense geopolitical environment of competition and heightened rhetoric&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;communication&quot;&gt;COMMUNICATION&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8) Confused and blurred messaging due to nonstop, multivariate communications from both allies and adversaries through multiple private and public channels&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9) Increased nuclear threats and blackmail from adversaries, including during times of crisis&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;other&quot;&gt;OTHER&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10) Increased economic coercion though political demands and widening global interconnectivity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11) Increased number and influence of autocratic regimes around the world, some of which are strongly supported by domestic populist movements&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants were asked to vote on the trends and drivers that will have the greatest effect on the future extended deterrence mission. This allowed PONI to cluster the key trends and develop a consensus on which drivers are likely to be the most significant over the next 10 years. The three most significant trends were the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Growth and diversification of nuclear arsenals&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Synchronization challenges given multipolar nuclear threats stressing alliance networks&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Confused and blurred messaging due to nonstop, multivariate communications&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PONI team then used the results of the first workshop and the top two drivers (growing arsenals and synchronization challenges) to develop four alternative future scenarios. PONI defined the first factor as adversaries expanding their nuclear arsenals quantitatively and qualitatively, to include means of delivery, such as hypersonic glide vehicles or dual-capable systems. With these alternative future scenarios, this research sought to illuminate how key drivers might shape future extended deterrence dynamics and requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 1 captures the four scenarios derived from changes in adversary capabilities and alliance cohesion: (1) opportunistic competition, (2) bloc competition, (3) shifting nonnuclear competition, and (4) competition and cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hpom8un.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: Alternative Nuclear Future Scenarios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PONI team then generated stories that describe these futures and how they could plausibly unfold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second and third workshops focused on evaluating these future scenarios and their implications, potential benefits and challenges, and risks. In particular, the workshops focused on the implications of these scenarios for (1) core aspects of the U.S. nuclear mission (i.e., how nuclear capabilities play into integrated deterrence concepts, deterrence, extended deterrence, and assurance); (2) stability and escalation risks; (3) arms control and nonproliferation; and (4) broad and enduring U.S. strategic objectives, including those related to strategic competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scenarios assume that in 2032, Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping remain in power in Russia and China respectively and that they continue to pursue regional ambitions and challenge the U.S.-led alliance-based international order. Both leaders are under increasing pressure to demonstrate progress in achieving their strategic aims. Putin strives to solidify his legacy and return Russia to an era of greatness following the war in Ukraine, and Xi is under pressure to deliver on promises of Chinese greatness as the People’s Republic approaches its 100th anniversary. Among allies, the scenarios assume that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) still exists, as do alliances in the Indo-Pacific, and that there are no new nuclear actors in 2032. The scenarios assume the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) is still in force and that there has not been an extension or replacement of New START. Finally, the scenarios assume that the United States is following through on its current nuclear modernization plans and the program of record and is nearing completion of the modernization of the triad. As a final caveat, this analysis focuses on nuclear expansion by Russia and China and does not explicitly address North Korea or nuclear actors in the Middle East or South Asia. This was primarily because Russia and China were the focus of expert interviews and workshops; however, the authors acknowledge that actors outside Europe and Asia will impact the U.S. extended deterrence mission and these are explored in the “wild card” scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;analysis&quot;&gt;Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The four alternative futures identify specific challenges for future and current U.S. extended deterrence requirements. They also identify signposts to indicate which scenario the United States might be moving toward, along with recommendations for how to navigate (or avoid) that pathway. The four scenarios below range from a “worst-case scenario” to a relatively stable competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scenario-1-opportunistic-competition&quot;&gt;Scenario 1: Opportunistic Competition&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opportunistic competition is a scenario of high adversary capabilities and low alliance cohesion. In this future, China and Russia are expanding their nuclear arsenals quantitatively and qualitatively, and the United States struggles to maintain robust alliances.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the CSIS PONI workshops, one participant pointed out, “From the allies’ perspective, this is the world we are currently living in.” Although this is the worst-case scenario, it is also the most likely based on current trends among adversaries and allies — though this may depend on the outcome of the war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this future, China’s nuclear arsenal stands at approximately 1,000 nuclear weapons and includes a functional nuclear triad. China’s modernization efforts leverage artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and the use of small satellites for both civilian and military purposes. Following the war in Ukraine, Russia determines its nuclear arsenal and nuclear coercion gives it a strategic advantage and increases its reliance on nuclear weapons. It focuses its modernization and expansion on new and advanced dual-capable intermediate-range missiles. It also develops new conventional systems to replace those lost in the war in Ukraine, predominantly drones and small satellites to improve its intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities. China increasingly coordinates with Russia; however, there is no evidence of a formal alliance between Beijing and Moscow. Instead, they both become increasingly aggressive in their respective regions, challenge the rules-based international order, and remain opportunistic in any collaboration. They are also willing to take advantage of U.S. distraction, internal debates, or regional disputes. Growing nuclear arsenals in combination with autocratic forms of government give the adversary an advantage, as they can control defense investment without limits and are more willing to manipulate nuclear risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allies are responding to the worsening security environment in diverse — and sometimes contradictory — ways, fracturing alliance cohesion and coordination and putting allies at odds with each other. European allies face multiple external and internal pressures. Externally, they continue to face persistent Russian nuclear threats and are increasingly called upon to contribute to NATO’s widening mission, including countering China’s regional aggression and global ambitions. This is a source of resentment for many western and southern European allies who have other priorities. Internally, they face growing antinuclear movements and economic pressures in the aftermath of the war in Ukraine. Operationally, NATO allies have not fully synchronized their intelligence and communication efforts and are at odds about their military contributions to the alliance. In the Indo-Pacific, allies are similarly divided about how to confront an increasingly aggressive China. The Australia–United Kingdom–United States (AUKUS) agreement is fracturing, and progress has slowed because of domestic politics in Canberra. Japan and South Korea are divided internally on how to handle China’s aggression, regional ambitions, and expansion of military capabilities. Asian allies see each other (and their European counterparts) as competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European allies remain concerned that the United States’ attention is focused on Asia, whereas Asian allies perceive the United States as distracted by the acute and enduring threat from Moscow. In Washington, decisionmakers are divided on the value of NATO and alliances and are pressuring allies to contribute more to their own defense, raising questions among allies about U.S. political commitments and the capabilities underpinning extended deterrence guarantees. Adversaries take advantage of these divisions to manipulate nuclear risks, particularly during crises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;implications&quot;&gt;IMPLICATIONS&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A future defined by opportunistic competition will ask more of the U.S. nuclear arsenal than any other point in its history. The scenario has the highest risk of escalation, as adversaries leverage nuclear weapons and dual-capable systems for opportunistic aggression and coercion to pursue regional gains, potentially resulting in simultaneous crises. The U.S. nuclear mission will likely need to expand to consider regional nuclear warfighting and to operate in “risk management mode,” unless it develops advanced conventional capabilities that can fulfill a similar strategic deterrent function, though this seems unlikely in the next decade. The United States will also need to expand investment in nonnuclear capabilities to maintain parity with Russia and China, including precision-guided conventional long-range strike capabilities, missile defense, and ISR. In short, this is a very expensive scenario. The United States will also need to do more to strengthen its credibility with allies, including modernizing the current arsenal and potentially establishing additional forward-deployed nuclear forces in allies’ territories to signal its commitment to their security. With allies at cross-purposes, they may also unintentionally entangle each other in regional crises in the absence of functioning synchronization and coordination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Formal, treaty-based arms control with verification is highly unlikely in this scenario, but there may be an increased focus on informal risk reduction efforts in an effort to manage regional crises. Adversaries, however, will rely on the risk of escalation and manipulation to achieve their aims and will be reluctant to engage in risk reduction or arms control measures that would have a hand-tying effect in a crisis. An additional challenge for arms control will be that allies may perceive any negotiation between Washington and Moscow or Beijing as a sign of abandonment or appeasement. In the absence of strong U.S. assurances, allies may reconsider their nonproliferation commitments and explore developing independent nuclear capabilities. One workshop participant referred to this scenario as the “danger zone” of proliferation threats, whereby even if allies do not pursue independent capabilities, they may instead rely on nuclear hedging or latency. Should allies seriously consider pursuing independent nuclear capabilities, this would have significant and disastrous consequences for the NPT and global nuclear order more broadly, particularly if a U.S. ally withdraws from the NPT or the alliance system collapses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;signposts&quot;&gt;SIGNPOSTS&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following indicators signify the strategic environment is on a pathway to opportunistic competition:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Continued expansion of adversary nuclear and nonnuclear arsenals despite economic and domestic pressures in the aftermath of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Increased requests for nuclear sharing and forward-deployed nuclear and conventional forces by allies&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Breakdown in existing agreements, such as NATO nuclear sharing or AUKUS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) Increased requests for joint planning and exercises or force posture changes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) Expressed allied interest in expanding strategic forces, potentially to include nuclear hedging or independent nuclear forces, along with precision-guided conventional long-range strike capabilities, missile defense systems, and additional U.S. foreign military sales&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6) Disputes among allies and a general lack of coordination on strategic priorities&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7) Increased requests from allies for consultations and assurances&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8) U.S. domestic debates about defense spending and the value of allies&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scenario-2-bloc-competition&quot;&gt;Scenario 2: Bloc Competition&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bloc competition is a scenario of high adversary capabilities and high alliance cohesion. In this future, China and Russia are expanding their nuclear arsenals quantitatively and qualitatively, and the United States maintains a strong and effective network of alliances.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, as in the previous one, China and Russia have expanded their nuclear arsenals quantitatively and qualitatively and are leveraging nuclear weapons for opportunistic aggression in their respective regions, working to drive a wedge between U.S. allies and manipulating risks to their advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the previous scenario, in bloc competition, the United States and its allies unite around the significant threats posed by two peer competitors and implement practical political and technical tools to synchronize their efforts in deterring Moscow and Beijing. The United States and its allies operate as a united bloc with well-coordinated mechanisms for sharing intelligence and conducting joint operations and exercises. More broadly, there is a shared sense of purpose in both Europe and Asia concerning the importance of alliances, particularly in the face of autocratic adversaries, and the two regions are not acting at cross-purposes or competing with one another. In Europe, allies maintain unity in the aftermath of the war in Ukraine. NATO has nearly completed its transformation to a robust and operational political and military alliance, and its members have maintained their commitments to defense spending and successfully integrated forces and capabilities. The United States successfully expands U.S.-Japan-Republic of Korea cooperation and integrates its security and economic initiatives in the Indo-Pacific — including the Quad and AUKUS — and is seen as a reliable and lasting leader in the region. The United States maintains robust and active consultations with allies, along with sustained domestic investment in U.S. strategic capabilities and a proven, enduring commitment to allies. Domestically, debates linger in Washington and in foreign capitals about defense spending, but there is an overarching commitment to alliances and a shared understanding about their strategic value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;implications-1&quot;&gt;IMPLICATIONS&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A future defined by bloc competition may force the United States to consider significantly expanding the nuclear mission at the regional level as a risk management tool, which may include additional nuclear sharing arrangements or forward deploying additional nuclear capabilities. Allies will need to coordinate and contribute to a larger strategic mission. Working-level and operational coordination will be particularly important. Alliance cohesion will serve an important function in deterring adversary aggression at the regional level, though adversaries will still attempt to manipulate nuclear risk to divide allies. As China and Russia develop more advanced and sophisticated arsenals, U.S. allies will request and field more robust conventional options, including precision-guided conventional long-range strike capabilities, missile defense, and ISR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, the prospects for arms control are still limited. Allies may encourage the United States to pursue bilateral or trilateral arms control with Beijing and Moscow to constrain their nuclear arsenals and better manage the significant escalation risks that exist in this future. But political pressures and the overall focus on competition will likely limit what, if anything, can be negotiated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;signposts-1&quot;&gt;SIGNPOSTS&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following indicators signify the strategic environment is on a pathway to bloc competition:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Continued expansion of adversary nuclear arsenals despite economic and domestic pressures in the aftermath of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Increased alliance requests for conventional capabilities that fill jointly agreed roles&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Increased allied support for collective deterrence and increased contributions toward a combined force posture&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) Shared principles and alliance coordination at the senior leadership level; at the working level, progress in intelligence sharing and operational planning contributing to a shared mission working in cooperation, rather than competition, across regions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) Greater allied interest in Washington pursuing arms control and risk reduction measures with Moscow and Beijing, though U.S. support is uncertain because of domestic factors&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6) Unified U.S. and allied domestic commitment to alliances&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scenario-3-shifting-competition&quot;&gt;Scenario 3: Shifting Competition&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shifting competition is a scenario of low adversary (nuclear) capabilities and low alliance cohesion. It is a future in which Chinese and Russian nuclear expansion stalls, competition shifts to other domains, and the United States struggles to maintain robust alliances.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scenario should not be perceived as adversaries failing to compete or ceding to U.S. regional and global supremacy; rather, it is one where adversaries shift to domains where they have a perceived competitive advantage. In this future, China’s nuclear arsenal stands at an estimated 450 warheads, well below previous projections. Sanctions and global exile in the aftermath of the war in Ukraine drastically weaken portions of the Russian economy, forcing Russia to divert resources to rebuild its conventional forces at the expense of its continued investment in strategic systems. Certain exotic delivery vehicles in Russia’s modernization program encounter technological challenges and component shortages. This scenario might see adversaries slowing their nuclear expansion but continuing to compete at the strategic level and invest in advanced nonnuclear capabilities. China and Russia largely shift competition to the conventional domain or “gray zone,” with an emphasis on disinformation campaigns to divide allies further. In this future, adversary disinformation campaigns are sowing doubt among U.S. allies about the longevity of U.S. commitments, making it difficult to coordinate effective responses and deterrence campaigns, as well as fueling disagreements over what mix of conventional, non-kinetic, and nuclear capabilities the United States and its allies need. Allies remain fearful of U.S. abandonment because of competing priorities and entrapment should the United States escalate future crises without consulting allies or building alliance cohesion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Europe, NATO is fractured, with some states preferring to cut their defense spending due to domestic and economic pressures in the aftermath of the war in Ukraine. Russia’s slowing nuclear expansion also raises questions about the enduring value of NATO’s nuclear mission, putting some allies at odds over whether the United States should withdraw nuclear weapons from Europe and make unilateral cuts to the U.S. nuclear arsenal. Overall, political disagreements and isolationist policies weaken NATO and decrease the credibility of collective action. In the Indo-Pacific region, AUKUS stalls for domestic reasons, but also because of changing attitudes throughout the region — including in Tokyo and Seoul — about the threat posed by China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;implications-2&quot;&gt;IMPLICATIONS&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A future defined by shifting competition will renew domestic debates about the size and purpose of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. Some will argue that the United States should use the stall in Russian and Chinese investment to outcompete them in nuclear capabilities, while continuing to compete in conventional and advanced technologies — though this will face significant domestic challenges. Others will argue that the United States should focus on outcompeting in conventional and advanced technologies while pursuing nuclear arms control efforts, which may face domestic opposition but would strengthen the international nuclear regime if successful. In both cases, the United States will need to compete with Russia and China in emerging and disruptive technologies as a component of an extended deterrence strategy. In this scenario, the risk of escalation and confrontation will not disappear, but rather shift to the nonnuclear level of conflict in a new version of the stability-instability paradox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a scenario of shifting competition, the security landscape will look drastically different. The United States and its allies will need to develop coherent and meaningful responses to disinformation, gray zone, and cyber activities. In this future, the United States will have to rebuild alliance structures and convey the need for defense partnerships in a world where competition with adversaries is less visible and thus harder to communicate to allies and publics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some allies — particularly in Western Europe — may question the enduring value of the U.S. nuclear umbrella if they perceive Russian and Chinese nuclear threats as waning. Others will be reluctant to support arms control initiatives and will continue to see the U.S. nuclear umbrella as the ultimate backstop against ongoing threats from North Korea and as a means to keep China and Russia’s more aggressive gray zone tactics from escalating. Some allies may be increasingly tempted to join the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, for example, under domestic pressure to show tangible progress toward fulfilling the Article VI commitments of the NPT, especially if Russia and China are reducing their arsenals. The United States will need focus on deterring nonnuclear threats while continuing to explain to allies the importance of nuclear weapons in an overarching strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;signposts-2&quot;&gt;SIGNPOSTS&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following indicators signify the strategic environment is on a pathway to nonnuclear competition:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Increased Russian and Chinese disinformation campaigns and gray zone activities&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Backpedaling by China and Russia on investments and rhetoric surrounding nuclear modernization programs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Increased coordination and cooperation between Moscow and Beijing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) Gray zone conflicts at the sub-strategic level&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) Increased investment in nonnuclear strategic capabilities by adversaries&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6) Allies’ wavering commitment to nuclear deterrence&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7) Breakdown of alliances such as AUKUS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scenario-4-competition-and-cooperation&quot;&gt;Scenario 4: Competition and Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Competition and cooperation is a scenario of low adversary capabilities and high alliance cohesion. In this future, Chinese and Russian nuclear expansion stalls, and the United States maintains a strong and effective network of alliances.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in the previous scenario, economic challenges largely stall Russian and Chinese development of nuclear and advanced capabilities. In an effort to offset their stalled modernization efforts, Moscow and Beijing form a closer partnership with deeper economic, military, and political integration. They now conduct regular joint military exercises and disinformation campaigns in an attempt to divide U.S. allies. Both maintain nuclear forces for coercive purposes but focus investments primarily in advanced nonnuclear and non-kinetic capabilities to support increased gray zone activities, creating a more complex and integrated version of the stability-instability paradox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this future, European and Asian allies share a common view of the threat posed by a united China and Russia. For the United States and its allies, unity is crucial. There is a shared sense of purpose in acting as an alliance of democracies in the face of an autocratic bloc. As a result, the United States and its allies overcome information-sharing and classification challenges and develop more effective mechanisms for countering cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;implications-3&quot;&gt;IMPLICATIONS&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the four possible futures, this scenario is the most stable and attractive security environment for the United States and its allies. However, the growing alliance between China and Russia will complicate planning and debates over what mix of nuclear and nonnuclear capabilities are needed. The implications for the U.S. nuclear mission in this scenario will be similar to those in the shifting competition scenario, whereby the United States can choose from outcompeting Russia and China in nuclear weapons, shifting investments to advanced capabilities, or using the opportunity to pursue arms control and negotiate limits on Russian and Chinese nuclear and nonnuclear capabilities. Allies who feel more assured under the U.S. nuclear umbrella and work in coordination with each other may be more likely to support arms control negotiations. Moscow and Beijing, faced with a united alliance and significant economic challenges, may be more open to such efforts. However, formal arms control will continue to be a challenge for the United States domestically and many allies could see further reductions in U.S. nuclear and nonnuclear capabilities as a sign of waning commitment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;signposts-3&quot;&gt;SIGNPOSTS&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following indicators signify the strategic environment is on a pathway to competition and cooperation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Backpedaling by Russia on rhetoric surrounding nuclear modernization programs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Increased coordination and cooperation between Moscow and Beijing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Gray zone conflicts at the sub-strategic level&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) Increased investment in nonnuclear strategic capabilities by adversaries&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) Uptick in adversary uses of disinformation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6) Improved alliance coordination — particularly at the working level — in intelligence sharing, countering cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns, nonnuclear defense cooperation, and other policy areas, such as arms control&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7) Unified U.S. and allied domestic commitment to alliances&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;wild-card-scenarios&quot;&gt;“Wild Card” Scenarios&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above four scenarios are informed by the two primary factors of adversary capabilities and alliance cohesion, along with the assumptions identified at the outset of this report; however, significant and unforeseen changes beyond these factors could fundamentally alter the nature of the security environment over the next decade. The PONI workshops also identified potential “wild card” factors that would have implications for U.S. extended deterrence but did not come up explicitly in the context of the four scenarios identified above. These include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chinese invasion of Taiwan to achieve unification by force&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Change in Iran’s nuclear status&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian victory in the war in Ukraine, potentially involving nuclear use&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Significant U.S. domestic political changes, such as an insurrection&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Global economic depression&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Global pandemic&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;North Korean use of weapons of mass destruction&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A thorough analysis of these events was outside of the scope of this study, but the majority of these events would likely increase stress on alliances and result in allies asking for greater assurances from the United States, both in terms of forward-deployed capabilities and political commitments to ensure their security. Other “wild cards,” however — such as economic collapse or U.S. domestic instability — could create untenable pressures on U.S. defense spending and nuclear modernization that would force a change in extended deterrence commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scenario-comparisons&quot;&gt;Scenario Comparisons&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three important similarities across all scenarios. First, adversaries will continue to challenge U.S. regional and global supremacy and will attempt to drive a wedge between Washington and its allies. Adversaries will seek to advance their interests through opportunistic aggression and by manipulating risks — particularly during crises — with the belief that the United States is risk averse and will seek a negotiated peace, and that increased risks will divide U.S. allies. Second, allies will require assurance from the United States, in both word and deed, in any of these scenarios. Maintaining a credible U.S. extended deterrent will not only strengthen security for the United States and its allies, but also have important nonproliferation benefits and improve alliance cohesion. In the broader context, the United States will be leading an alliance of democracies in the face of aggressive autocracies. Finally, arms control or risk reduction measures will be of interest to allies in all the scenarios (albeit in different forms) except the first one, which might see allies withdraw from the NPT and develop their own nuclear capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite their similarities, the scenarios also have enough variation to point to how factors such as alliance unity will affect the U.S. nuclear mission. The means by which adversaries pursue their strategic interests will have implications for the U.S. nuclear force posture and how the United States invests in its strategic capabilities. For example, if Russia shifts investment to conventional and non-kinetic capabilities in the aftermath of the war in Ukraine, this may alleviate pressure on U.S. nuclear modernization. However, it will also increase the need for the United States to invest in offensive and defensive nonnuclear advanced capabilities while continuing to maintain a credible extended nuclear deterrent. Another point of variation is the degree to which Russia and China are acting in collusion. On the one hand, a sense of a unified adversarial challenge may galvanize alliance cohesion. On the other hand, a unified effort by Moscow and Beijing could sow seeds of distrust among U.S. allies through gray zone tactics and disinformation campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another point of variation among the scenarios is what arms control might look like. In most of the scenarios, traditional arms control treaties will be difficult because the United States may prioritize freedom of action in how it responds to adversary buildups. In these scenarios, allies may support informal risk reduction measures, such as “Incidents at Sea”–style agreements that create political commitments and set “rules of the road” for nuclear and nonnuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In most of the scenarios, traditional arms control treaties will be difficult because the United States may prioritize freedom of action in how it responds to adversary buildups.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-findings-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Key Findings and Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding:&lt;/strong&gt; Competition is inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the scenarios in this report, even if adversaries develop nuclear capabilities at a slower pace than expected, they will increase investment and focus on nonnuclear strategic capabilities, particularly non-kinetic capabilities that will complicate U.S. decisionmaking in regional crises and challenge alliance cohesion. In short, the United States needs to prepare for a sustained era of competition with Russia and China as well as allies that will require ever-increasing security assurances. One particularly unique trait of this era of competition is the adversaries’ willingness to manipulate nuclear risk and rely on nuclear weapons because they assume the United States and its allies will be risk averse. This will increase the stability-instability paradox, complicating U.S. decisionmaking and potentially undermining the cohesion of the United States’ alliances and the credibility of its assurances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number and type of contested domains where competition and conflict can occur have grown from the Cold War era when alliances were formed and are increasingly blurred. Gray zone tactics such as disinformation campaigns, cyberattacks, and economic coercion — that target both the United States and its allies — allow adversaries to impose costs while hoping to avoid triggering escalation to a conventional war, let alone a nuclear one. This is raising questions about what the United States and its partners and allies should aim to deter and, depending on how and when deterrence fails, what types of responses may be appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; The Department of Defense (DOD) and National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) should prioritize efforts to develop a nuclear enterprise that is agile, flexible, and responsive to the shifting geopolitical landscape as part of an integrated deterrence strategy. This will require engaging with Congress as well as the private sector and reforming defense investment and procurement, including for the nuclear enterprise. While the 2022 U.S. Nuclear Posture Review states that “‘hedging against an uncertain future’ is no longer a stated role for nuclear weapons,” the management of the U.S. nuclear enterprise must maintain a state of responsive readiness. The best way to prepare for the future is to build a flexible nuclear enterprise capable of tackling new and emerging threats as they arise. Additionally, there should be a shared understanding among allies about the mix of capabilities, both nuclear and nonnuclear, that are required to effectively deter adversaries, and greater insight into how the U.S. nuclear enterprise and wider defense infrastructure is working to fill any gaps. Given that greater alliance cooperation will enhance U.S. competitiveness and potentially allow for a pooling of resources, allies can and should be part of this effort through consultations and transparency measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding:&lt;/strong&gt; Alliance cohesion and synchronization is essential for effective extended nuclear deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has a long history of maintaining strong defense ties across Europe and Asia; however, isolationist policies and a decline in U.S. leadership pose significant obstacles to maintaining the strong network of alliances and partners that have kept the United States safe for decades. If alliance cohesion can be maintained, allies will be a force multiplier for the United States at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels. Communicating deterrence requirements and coordinating messages will be challenging in an era of disinformation and public pressures against nuclear weapons in democratic capitals. The path that leads to high alliance cohesion will not be easy. At times, disagreements will run high; however, a lack of disagreement may be a signpost indicating insincerity in dialogue and underlying alliance cohesion challenges. Since the end of World War II, U.S. commitments to provide for the defense of allies have furthered the U.S. nonproliferation mission. The 2022 U.S. Nuclear Posture Review notes “extended nuclear deterrence contributes to U.S. non-proliferation goals by giving Allies and partners confidence that they can resist strategic threats and remain secure without acquiring nuclear weapons of their own.” However, fundamental trust in the U.S. ability to secure collective defense is far from guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Current and future administrations should strengthen U.S. interagency efforts to invest, commit, message, and consult with U.S. allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Invest in a responsive and adaptable nuclear infrastructure:&lt;/em&gt; Capability and credibility go hand in hand. One of the best ways to maintain a strong alliance and to avoid intra-alliance competition will be for the United States, and the DOD specifically, to sustain funding for defense infrastructure writ large, to include the nuclear enterprise, while also competing in advanced technologies and remaining responsive to nonnuclear threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Commit to long-term alliances:&lt;/em&gt; U.S. policymakers and defense leaders should signal an enduring bipartisan political commitment to alliances. While political shifts are inevitable, a robust signal from Washington about the strategic importance of alliances writ large may assuage many concerns about abandonment. In addition, the DOD can take steps now to institutionalize cooperation with allies at the working level, which can further reinforce the long-term nature of U.S. commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Manage alliance communication:&lt;/em&gt; DOD officials, in particular, can signal the equal importance of alliances in both Europe and Asia through improved communication and messaging. The National Defense Strategy and the focus on integrated deterrence caused some concerns, particularly in Europe, that American attention will be region-specific and some allies might be left behind. Many allies remain confused about what “integrated deterrence” means in practice and are not satisfied with U.S. explanations that European and Asian allies are of “equal importance,” while still referring to China as the long-term “pacing challenge.” Senior DOD officials should clarify this issue to help assure allies. The United States can also ask allies to contribute more to alliance security overall, such as through defense spending and joint activities. Policymakers will have to approach this delicately, however, or risk being perceived as “pressuring” allies to do more as indicative of waning U.S. commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Revamp and strengthen alliance consultations:&lt;/em&gt; In the expert workshop, numerous allies indicated that what the United States considers “consultation” is often a one-sided conversation and allies do not always feel like their voices are being heard. A business-as-usual approach to extended deterrence consultations will prove ineffective in virtually all future scenarios. The increasingly complex threat environment will require a much higher level of integration with and among allies. This is particularly true in East Asia, but it also applies to NATO allies who will need to understand how heightened threats from China and North Korea could affect planning and operations in Europe and vice versa. This means that strengthening consultation mechanisms with allies will first and foremost require much more detailed conversations about specific threats, and what specifically alliances intend to deter. To prepare for this, the DOD should develop a long-term road map for revamping U.S. consultation mechanisms and work with the U.S. interagency to take a more holistic approach to reassuring allies, including through regular consultations before policy is set. The road map should also focus on increased cross-alliance activities, such as joint exercising and intelligence sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engaging allies with tailored messaging:&lt;/em&gt; In addition, the DOD can do more to engage with allies in joint wargaming and exercises and by directly involving allies in adaptive U.S. planning. In Europe, this might also entail allies taking on a greater role in alliance strategic planning in NATO, potentially to include more burden sharing. Joint coordination with Asian allies may be more challenging in the absence of a central alliance structure, but the United States should make every effort to take a more inclusive approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding:&lt;/strong&gt; Arms control is possible. It could entail informal risk reduction measures or options focused on nonnuclear capabilities. Arms control and risk reduction efforts in the future would not necessarily be unilateral measures by the United States or any of its allies, but rather reciprocal efforts with Russia and/or China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arms control and nonproliferation efforts can work hand in hand with extended deterrence. If done effectively, arms control can serve to stabilize competition and assure allies that certain types of dangerous capabilities will not be fielded. The study’s scenarios and workshops indicate that progress on nuclear arms control may be more likely if the contours of geopolitical competition shift slightly away from the nuclear domain. If the United States and its adversaries rely less on nuclear weapons and more on strategic conventional capabilities, allies may support and encourage more direct nuclear arms control efforts by the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; While formal arms control treaties and reductions are unlikely in the near future, the DOD and the U.S. interagency should work with U.S. allies to develop new approaches to strategic risk reduction to manage competition with Russia and China. These new approaches can be more flexible than traditional treaty-based arms control, but transparency and verification will still be necessary guiding principles to ensure compliance by all parties. At the same time, the United States should remain open to arms control opportunities when they arise and consult closely with allies about potential cooperation with Moscow or Beijing. If progress is made on arms control efforts, there will inevitably be costs. The United States may need to engage in trade-offs. U.S. adversaries have consistently voiced interest in arms control negotiations on the deployment and development of missile defense and space capabilities. Trade-offs on these capabilities will likely make some allies uneasy. As the United States remains open to arms control opportunities, it is crucial to incorporate allies into discussions and ensure allied buy-in. Allies should be consulted throughout any arms control dialogues, particularly about the design of arms control agreements, to mitigate potential fears of U.S. appeasement and to take into account allies’ escalation concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;鍾錦麟：曾向戴耀廷反映無差別否決財案或致DQ 獲回應只提積極運用基本法權力&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;鍾錦麟：趙家賢與戴耀廷就區選協調已「弄得相當不快」 隨初選執行擔憂與不滿越來越強&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;鍾錦麟：建制媒體批評初選遂憂DQ風險 對戴耀廷稱否決財案合法「疑中留情」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/teWR66Q.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（5日）踏入審訊第53天。時任民主動力副召集人鍾錦麟繼續作供，表示在2020年4月新界東首次協調會議完結後，曾私下向戴耀廷表示，若無差別否決預算案很可能導致參選人被DQ，戴回應「咁我唔會要求大家去無差別咁去否決財政預算案」，只會提「積極運用基本法權力」，又指「我講明係基本法嘅權力就唔會有問題啦啩？」。鍾指，首次會議集中討論初選技術問題，沒印象提及否決預算案，但認為戴相關想法是「人所共知」。鍾確認，戴在會議後曾發出新東協議文件，但沒為意在最終版本協議，運用否決權字眼由「會積極運用」改為「會運用」。鍾錦麟上午完成主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官關注審訊進度-着控方不要重複無爭議議題&quot;&gt;官關注審訊進度 着控方不要重複無爭議議題&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉今甫開庭表示，控方案情原定需55天，現時已是審訊第53天，他指當然知道審訊進度，並不是要怪責控方，但相信現時控方已清楚本案真正的議題。陳並指，鍾錦麟昨日的證供除個人背景外，大部分都是沒有爭議，「我們不希望聽取有關初選舉行的證供3次」，着控方不要重複。羅天瑋表示會緊記此點，不會問沒爭議的議題。陳慶偉並提醒他要不時望向左邊的辯方律師，指「他們沒有抄下任何筆記」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾稱曾向戴耀廷稱否決財案或被dq-戴稱講明基本法權力唔會有問題啦啩&quot;&gt;鍾稱曾向戴耀廷稱否決財案或被DQ 戴稱講明基本法權力「唔會有問題啦啩」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;時任民主動力副召集人鍾錦麟昨供稱，獲戴耀廷邀請主持新東會議，他今稱首次新東會議完結後，他在會議室外「拉咗戴耀廷埋一邊」，告訴他「出邊有好多嘅講法，如果我哋會去無差別咁否決財政預算案呢，好可能會導致我哋所有人都被DQ嘅，可唔可以唔好要求大家去否決財政預算案」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾在法官李運騰追問下表示，這是他和戴的私人對話，「純粹係我同戴耀廷之間嘅對話，我向佢表達我嘅憂慮」；而他是以正常聲線說話，因為已「散咗會」，當時可能有一兩個人如時任沙田區議會主席程張迎在附近，但不肯定有否聽到。鍾並指，當時其他與會者已離開，趙家賢和區諾軒也不在場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾續指，戴當時回應：「咁我唔會要求大家去無差別咁去否決財政預算案，我只會話積極運用基本法嘅權力去否決財政預算案」，又指「我講明係基本法嘅權力就唔會有問題啦啩？」，鍾引述後句時聲調在結尾略為提高。李運騰問，留意到鍾的語調改變，問戴當時是否提出問題，鍾同意「係一個問題」，並指認為自己已很如實反映戴當時的語調。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾稱戴耀廷望否決財案想法人所共知惟首次會議冇印象有提及&quot;&gt;鍾稱戴耀廷望否決財案想法「人所共知」惟首次會議「冇印象」有提及&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，鍾當時向戴提出該議題，是與會上發言有關嗎？鍾指「我係基於戴耀廷希望用35+否決財政預算案嘅想法，我會形容係人所共知嘅」。法官陳仲衡問，該想法或是「人所共知」，但協調會議上有否提出？鍾答「冇印象」，而他向戴耀廷提出，是因看到很多不同團體，如親政府或親中央政府的人士表示若無差別否決預算案，會導致參選人被DQ。李運騰問，故在4月中，社會上已有意見指出，無差別否決預算案會成為參選人被DQ的理由？鍾同意，亦同意戴是對他們作出回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;羅天瑋其後展示戴耀廷3月3日發布的〈反制警察政權就要立會奪半〉、3月10日的〈齊上齊落 目標35+〉，鍾確認均在與戴耀廷對話前看過。鍾表示，除上述私人對話，便沒有與戴耀廷就同一議題再討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾稱首次會議集中初選技術問題-戴耀廷區諾軒不停參與討論&quot;&gt;鍾稱首次會議集中初選技術問題 戴耀廷區諾軒不停參與討論&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉其後問，首次會議有否聽到社民連陳寶瑩表示反對意見？鍾稱「冇印象」，「因為我記得當日嘅會議真係集中喺個初選點樣去進行嘅技術問題，係關於初選定棄選方案，同目標出選議席嘅方案」，並再確認與戴的討論只是基於戴發表的文章，以及媒體上建制派人士的意見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾錦麟昨供稱獲戴耀廷邀請主持新東會議，他今指戴沒邀請他主持某次會議，惟「總之呢個區會議都係我主持」。李運騰一度笑問，鍾稱首次會議遲到，到達時與會者已在發言，「那你怎樣主持會議？會議怎能在你不在時開始？」鍾解釋因時任沙田區議會主席程張迎也有主持會議，而戴耀廷和區諾軒「喺成個會議過程都有不停去參與討論」。李問他有否參與任何討論，鍾指就是主持兩項討論，即昨提及的採用「初選」或「棄選」方案，及目標議席數量。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;羅天瑋其後問，鍾在5月底有否與戴會面，鍾稱「冇印象」。至於5月5日的新東第二次會議，鍾指他原本應該要出席，但因當天區議會逾時，故沒有出席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾確認戴在兩次新東會議後均發出協調文件-相信曾發給所有與會者&quot;&gt;鍾確認戴在兩次新東會議後均發出協調文件 相信曾發給所有與會者&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;羅天瑋續展示 WhatsApp 紀錄，顯示戴耀廷在首次新東會議兩日後的4月16日，曾發出名為「35+新東」的文件，鍾確認有收到及打開，但就運用否決權字眼，「冇好準確印象究竟係『會』定係『積極』。」鍾並指，在戴向所有新東協調會議參與者發出上述文件前，他曾透過私人 WhatsApp 對話從戴收到一個初稿，並與戴討論目標議席的寫法與會議的共識有不同，戴更正後再向大家發文件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉問，鍾如何得知戴將文件發給所有人？鍾解釋，因戴發訊息後，他曾在新民主同盟的 WhatsApp 群組收到范國威轉發同一份文件，故相信戴「係將呢份文件廣發咗畀唔同嘅人」，他並確認修正的版本反映會上討論的事項。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;戴在第二次新東會議的兩日後，於5月7日發出「35+新東final」文件，鍾確認收到相關訊息。控方續展示該份「35+立會過半計劃 民主派新界東協調機制協議」文件，惟鍾指沒有印象，「因為我似乎冇開到」，其後亦指因他沒參與第二次會議，「亦都冇特別興趣睇返個會議嘅文件。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;羅天瑋一度問文件與「35+新東」是否相似，惟法官陳慶偉打斷指他們可看到；羅亦問鍾有否與戴就文件字眼討論，陳慶偉着問下一條問題，李運騰亦指證人已表示對文件沒印象。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾稱沒為意協議最終版本字眼由會積極運用改為會運用&quot;&gt;鍾稱沒為意協議最終版本字眼由「會積極運用」改為「會運用」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾續確認，戴耀廷於6月8日，在趙家賢要求下於組織者群組發出各個選區協議的最終版本，包括「35+新東final」，鍾有收到和打開，但沒有與戴討論，亦對新東文件「冇話特別大興趣」。鍾並確認5月7日和6月8日發出的文件內容一樣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾同意法官李運騰指，沒爭議4月中發出的「35+新東」文件使用「會積極運用」否決權字眼，但重申4月收到文件時「冇特別去留意」，因他只是留意「係咪按照戴耀廷嘅講法係講明係基本法嘅權力」；李續問，那鍾有沒有留意到在6月8日的「35+新東final」文件，運用否決權字眼由「會積極運用」改為「會運用」？鍾指「冇為意」。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 前排左起：區諾軒、戴耀廷、趙家賢、程張迎（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾表示，直至7月10日，也沒有收到與會者對新東文件提出反對或投訴，又一度提及6月10日曾發布「墨落無悔」。羅天瑋其後問，鍾就「墨落無悔」有什麼想告訴法庭？惟陳慶偉即打斷，指雖然控方要問開放的問題，但不是如宇宙般廣閣（as wide as universe），着他問具體的問題，又指控方有「墨落無悔」的聲明，究竟想問鍾什麼？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;墨落無悔提已取得共識-鍾稱以為係咪就否決預算案已有共識&quot;&gt;「墨落無悔」提「已取得共識」 鍾稱「以為係咪就否決預算案已有共識」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;羅天瑋其後展示何桂藍 Facebook 的「墨落無悔」帖文，提及「在初選協調會議上已取得共識的共同綱領」，問鍾如何理解「共識」。鍾指以其理解，首次會議是關於「初選上面邊啲人去參選、邊啲人唔去參選，點樣遵守呢個機制」，「而我睇到呢個『墨落無悔』嘅時候，會以為係咪已經就住否決財政預算案方面，已經有共識。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，民主動力負責草擬提名表格，鍾稱他沒有參與，只是在組織者群組看過總幹事黎敬輝發出的文件，表示「可以啦」。鍾亦是「新東訊息發布區」的成員，指因趙家賢想他幫手在群組內「幫手睇吓，幫吓眼」。鍾亦同意，曾以區議會主席身分幫忙物色票站，及提供議員辦事處作票站，在7月11日至12日的初選投票日均有親自協助，趙家賢7月12日晚亦有到場視察。羅天瑋發問時一度說錯投票日為7月11至13日。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;羅其後稱會引用有關初選流程的訊息發問，惟法官李運騰打斷問有何相關性，陳慶偉亦問趙家賢在其辦事處與案何關。羅指望完整本案有關流程的部分，以及鍾的參與，惟李運騰指所有人都知道不同議員辦事處用作票站，「我們不是審理這名證人，是審理各個被告。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;羅天瑋其後問鍾，昨稱與戴耀廷7月進行討論，是討論了什麼，惟陳慶偉指問題太空泛，下令早休，又着羅要準備好問題。羅早休後稱沒有其他問題，進入辯方盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/grL473v.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（5日）踏入審訊第53天。時任民主動力副召集人鍾錦麟接受辯方盤問，供稱趙家賢早在2020年初前，已就區議會選舉協調與戴耀廷「弄得相當不快」，而在初選協調時亦對戴是否將初選遇到的問題告知民動「有好多擔憂同不滿」，且越來越強烈。鍾並指，2020年2月3名民動召集人與戴耀廷會面時沒討論參選人當選後如何行事，指民動過往協調也沒監察當選議員的投票取態，「我認為戴耀廷都唔會覺得民主動力有力去執行民主派議員喺立法會嘅所作所為。」鍾又同意，首次新東會議無提及否決財政預算案，並同意否決財案的確令許多民主派議員「擺喺一個非常之困難嘅情況」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾同意梁國雄否決財案其中一個原因是沒有全民退保&quot;&gt;鍾同意梁國雄否決財案其中一個原因是沒有全民退保&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;時任民主動力副召集人鍾錦麟今早完成主問，由代表鄭達鴻和梁國雄的大律師黃宇逸進行盤問。鍾錦麟同意，社民連是左翼政黨，「佢哋都係咁樣去宣稱」，亦一直爭取全民退休保障、對爭取雙普選「亦非常之堅定」，而梁國雄的政治立場與社民連一致。鍾又指，知悉曾任立法會議員的梁國雄常提倡全民退保，亦常提及否決預算案的其中一個原因是沒有全民退保。黃宇逸完成盤問，其後代表吳政亨和余慧明、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明的大狀，及自行代表的劉偉聰均稱沒有盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾稱趙家賢不希望民主動力被邊緣化-是參與協調最主要原因&quot;&gt;鍾稱趙家賢不希望民主動力被邊緣化 是參與協調「最主要原因」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表林卓廷和黃碧雲的大律師沈士文其後盤問，沈先指鍾於2022年12月19日和2023年1月28日曾錄取兩份無損權益口供，並就民主動力參與協調的原因發問。鍾錦麟昨供稱，趙家賢望參與2020年立法會換屆選舉的協調，望在選舉「有角色」。沈指趙和民主動力有興趣協調的其中一個原因，是因民動自2012年已進行同樣的協調工作，鍾同意，並指民動自2016年立法會選舉「有付出過努力去協調」，惟只在2018年新東及九西立法會補選「成功過一次」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/h8OjR4v.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
▲ 黃碧雲（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈續指，趙如此熱衷參與協調有兩個原因，即民主動力多年來進行協調，邏輯上（logically）應繼續做協調；及趙家賢不希望民主動力被邊緣化和排除在外。鍾稱前者並非最主要原因，指「我唔能夠肯定係咪理所當然」；而後者是趙望做協調的「最主要原因」，因這會影響之後區議會選舉的協調工作，趙是鑑於2019年區選結果有此擔憂。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾同意民主動力2月同意與戴耀廷同辦初選會上無提否決預算案&quot;&gt;鍾同意民主動力2月同意與戴耀廷同辦初選、會上無提否決預算案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾同意，就2020年立法會選舉的工作，「冇乜人睬」趙家賢，但趙對協調工作仍很有興趣，民動另一名副召集人馮志活知情後便介入，「將民主動力同戴耀廷區諾軒兩方面撮合」，4人遂在2020手2月於太古城一間酒店的餐廳會面。鍾同意辯方指，會面目的是讓戴耀廷和民主動力一同參與選舉協調工作，「令到兩邊唔需要做重複嘅事情。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈續指，根據鍾的無損權益口供，戴會上從無提及否決預算案。鍾同意，並指戴主要談及望泛民取得立會過半，會面結果是同意戴和民主動力一同進行協調。法官李運騰問有否討論分工，鍾重申戴就初選流程、找人寫程式等「其實佢已經諗好晒㗎啦」，戴和區諾軒亦已在聯絡候選人；而「如果真係有啲協議需要有個團體去簽署呀，或者有銀行戶口做眾籌呀」，戴就希望民動幫手。惟鍾同意，雖有協議共同組織初選，但沒有簽署任何文件或合約。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾同意民動及戴耀廷當時不關注當選後如何行事-指過往協調亦無監察當選後取態&quot;&gt;鍾同意民動及戴耀廷當時不關注當選後如何行事 指過往協調亦無監察當選後取態&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾同意辯方指，從民動角度而言，3名召集人參與會面的目標很單純，只是希望協調民主派取得立會過半，亦從不關注參選人當選後如何行事。李運騰續問，戴耀廷在2月時同樣不關注參選人當選後如何行事？鍾指當時沒有相關討論，「因為我認為戴耀廷都唔會覺得民主動力有力去執行民主派議員喺立法會嘅所作所為。」鍾又舉例，過往民動雖有協調區議會選舉，但民動「亦都冇話去監察嗰啲區議員當選後嘅投票取態，係咪同民主派相近」，即不會有「懲罰機制」，故立法會的協調「都應該會好相近」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈其後再問，鍾個人參與「35+計劃」的目標是否讓民主派取得議會多數，從而可在制度內表達意見，鍾稱「認同，盡力去做」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾稱趙家賢在區選協調上同戴耀廷已經弄得相當不快對戴不滿越來越強&quot;&gt;鍾稱趙家賢在區選協調上「同戴耀廷已經弄得相當不快」、對戴不滿越來越強&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾錦麟同意，會議後戴耀廷和趙家賢就準備初選有緊密溝通，民動亦參與初選的準備工作，民動職員有協助；鍾亦開始閱讀戴有關否決預算案的文章。沈續問，會後趙家賢曾否表達對計劃的憂慮、並指答應辦初選前需考慮？鍾稱不肯定，但之後「趙家賢表達對戴耀廷嘅憂慮，呢個就絕對有嘅」，指趙對戴是否願意「將呢個初選裡面遇到嘅唔同問題都同民主動力講呢，係有好多嘅擔憂同不滿嘅」，且隨初選的執行，趙的擔憂和不滿越來越強烈。鍾亦指，早在2020年2月以前，在區議會選舉協調的事情上，趙家賢「同戴耀廷已經弄得相當不快」，同意在會面前趙對戴已有不太好的印象。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾稱沒聽過人不同意否決預算案-但的確令民主派擺在非常之困難情況&quot;&gt;鍾稱沒聽過人不同意否決預算案 但的確令民主派擺在「非常之困難」情況&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於鍾本人，他同意對戴耀廷提倡否決預算案有擔憂。被問是何時有此擔憂，鍾稱是在4月的新東協調會議前，戴將整個否決預算案的計劃「越嚟越具體化」、「講得越詳細」，而建制派或親中央政府人士反應越來越強烈的時候。鍾並指，沒有將其關注告知趙家賢，但於首次新東會議後有向戴表達，望戴不要要求參與者無差別否決財案。鍾同意辯方指，他表達上述關注是擔心會有DQ風險。沈續問，鍾除了擔心DQ，是否也擔心傳統民主派不會同意無差別否決預算案？鍾回應「呢個唔係我當時嘅考慮」，指有傳統民主派如公民黨亦曾於3月召記者會提出否決財案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈續引鍾口供，曾提及傳統民主派不會同意「攬炒」，因若政府提出建醫院，相信他們不會支持無差別否決預算案。鍾確認是其想法，但指與戴的對話沒提及。李運騰問鍾有否實際聽過民主派如此說，鍾指沒有，但指自己任區議會主席，其中一項政綱是擴建將軍澳醫院，「我只係覺得我呢個諗法，係會代表好多民主派地區工作者嘅諗法。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈其後再問，故鍾當時向戴耀廷表達擔憂，是認為將否決預算案加入計劃，很多民主派不會同意？鍾稱：「我冇聽過任何人話不同意呢個諗法，但係呢個情況的確會令好多嘅民主派，尤其是啱啱拎到主導權嘅區議會議員，擺喺一個非常之困難嘅情況。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾信戴稱否決財案冇問題-惟認不太理解積極運用及無差別分別&quot;&gt;鍾信戴稱否決財案「冇問題」 惟認不太理解「積極運用」及「無差別」分別&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾錦麟早前稱向戴耀廷表達關注後，戴回應「我唔會要求大家去無差別咁去否決財政預算案」，只會說「積極運用基本法嘅權力」否決預算案。鍾盤問下指「我當時相信咗戴耀廷嘅講法，而認為咁樣冇問題」，但承認事實上「唔係好理解兩者嘅差別」。法官陳仲衡續問，鍾當時是否相信無差別否決預算案是《基本法》賦予的權力？鍾稱他沒仔細考慮是否有「無差別」的權力，亦知道此舉有被DQ風險，「但呢個風險實際上理據係乜嘢呢，我當時係唔清楚嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾同意，戴其後稱「我講明係基本法嘅權力就唔會有問題啦啩？」是反問，並同意當時沒有再討論，是因相信戴的說法。沈指，戴作為法律教授，對法律的理解應比鍾更好，惟陳慶偉不批准發問，指情況不一定是這樣。鍾其後同意，他除調解外無任何專業的法律訓練，惟當辯方再問戴是否法律上更專業時，法官再打斷稱問題不需要，可留待陳詞。沈一度指盤問區諾軒時亦一直問相關問題，惟李運騰指「我們已聽夠了」，指該點沒需要。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾確認新東首次會議無討論否決財政預算案&quot;&gt;鍾確認新東首次會議無討論否決財政預算案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就新東首次會議情況，鍾同意會面原定晚上7至9時進行，他遲了約15至30分鐘到達，但不記得有其他與會者比他遲到，只記得有一個「唔關事、嚟錯咗個場地」的人。鍾稱會上約有20至30名參與者，但不記得社民連由誰代表，亦沒印象他有任何發言，但記得劉頴匡「佢有堅持用初選嘅方案囉，而唔係個棄選方案」，亦同意林卓廷沒有出席，但不記得民主黨代表是否莊榮輝。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾表示，負責主持會議的他、戴耀廷及程張迎沒有討論過分工，「只係個討論、個流程去到嗰個部分時鍾意就插嘴咁樣。」而他到場時與主持的程張迎、戴耀廷和區諾軒坐在同一排，與會者則坐在他們面前，戴耀廷要求參與者自我介紹後，便主要討論採用「初選」或「棄選」方案及目標議席，「我冇印象討論過其他嘢」，會上氣氛平靜。鍾今年1月28日於無損權益口供稱，「第一次新界東協調會會上未有討論否決財政預算案」，鍾確認內容正確。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就戴耀廷會議後發出的新東協調文件初稿和最終版本，鍾重申「冇去留意」運用否決權條款亦沒提反對，「因為我主要都係睇個初選嘅遊戲規則係點樣做」，並同意他較關注目標議席數量，對否決預算案議題則完全沒興趣。辯方問他沒提反對，是否因戴曾向他稱只會要求「積極運用基本法權力否決預算案」？鍾同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/UwlqEJt.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（5日）踏入審訊第53天，時任民主動力副召集人鍾錦麟繼續接受辯方盤問。被問為何認為否決預算案或致參選人被DQ，鍾稱是從媒體得知，指他「純粹相信」建制媒體的「風聲」某程度代表中央想法，而2019年後中央對港政策「唔會不為所動」，故認為有一個風險要謹慎處理。而對戴稱否決預算案是「《基本法》賦予的權力」，鍾對戴說法「疑中留情」，指不清楚會如何觸發中央調整對港政策，故「拆彈拆得一樣得一樣」。趙亦指，表面看來《基本法》的確賦予立法會相關權力，當時亦相信戴稱是「合法」，「我拗唔過戴耀廷。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，鍾稱何桂藍在新東首次會議上介紹自己為「立場姐姐」，惟何桂藍兩度大叫：「肯定冇！」她身旁的懲教一度按她的肩膊，法官亦着她不要叫囂。鍾亦表示，戴在2020年5月底曾向他表示所有初選協調已完成和有共識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾稱相信建制媒體某程度代表中央政府想法對初選批評來自建制不同方面&quot;&gt;鍾稱相信建制媒體某程度代表中央政府想法、對初選批評來自建制不同方面&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾錦麟下午接受代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 盤問。鍾今早供稱，新東首次會議後曾向戴耀廷表示無差別否決預算案或導致參選人被DQ，戴回應只會提「積極運用基本法權力」，又指「我講明係基本法嘅權力就唔會有問題啦啩？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9dPwvLu.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
▲ 代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問鍾為何認為否決預算案會導致參選人被DQ，鍾指「因為從媒體上面得知」。Beel 指他不明白，陳慶偉亦托頭笑指「媒體可以說很多事情（“Media can say a lot of things.”）」，鍾說「不幸地都會成真」，有人大笑。陳慶偉指只是部分而非全部，因為存在假資訊（disinformation），鍾回應所以有此擔憂。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續問，真正的問題是「為何鍾相信否決預算案可能導致DQ？」，並指原因更加重要，結論並不重要。鍾表示，「我純粹相信由建制媒體報導呢啲嘅風聲，某程度上都代表咗中央政府嘅諗法」，又指2019年社會事件後，「中央政府嘅對港政策唔會不為所動，所以我覺得係有呢一個風險要謹慎去處理」，並指對整個初選的批評是來自建制的不同方面，而非來自個別版塊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉問，因此鍾有此想法，是建基於建制派的說法？鍾同意，並指是在2019年的脈絡下閱讀相關訊息。陳續問，因此即使戴向他指這是基本法賦予的權力，也沒有改變他的看法？鍾指，「我帶住一個，或者咁講，『疑中留情』囉」，解釋是對戴耀廷的說法「疑中留情」，並指相信中央可能會有「組合拳」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法庭傳譯問「組合拳係咩？」，多人大笑，庭上亦議論紛紛，陳慶偉提議譯「combination of punches in boxing」、李運騰稱「combination of strategies」。鍾同意可算是一些「策略」，並指「但係千頭萬緒，唔清楚究竟乜嘢會觸發去大規模咁調整對港嘅政策，所以拆彈拆得一樣得一樣」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾稱當時相信戴耀廷稱否決財案合法-指我拗唔過戴耀廷&quot;&gt;鍾稱當時相信戴耀廷稱否決財案「合法」 指「我拗唔過戴耀廷」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指他不明白，指鍾在4月中時已對無差別否決預算案引致DQ感憂慮，而他特意在會後向戴表達，戴則只是以反問回應，「你就對戴耀廷的回應感到滿意？還是你有做什麼釋除疑慮？」鍾回應：「我覺得最好唔好（提否決預算案），但我當時相信咗戴耀廷話呢件事係合法嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李再指，戴是被批評的對象，但鍾卻對戴的解釋感滿意？鍾強調「我嘅關注就係有冇犯法」，指「表面睇，《基本法》的確係賦予咗立法會去審批政府開支嘅權力，我當刻唔能夠去答戴耀廷（否決預算案）點樣犯法」。鍾同意，此前已知道《基本法》賦予相關權力，李再問那與戴的對話有什麼改變他看法？鍾僅稱「我拗唔過戴耀廷」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 其後再問，鍾錦麟2020年是否相信參選人提出反政府的議題，有機會導致被DQ？鍾稱參考過往被DQ的例子，不可提倡「港獨」和「自決」，「呢個係紅線中嘅紅線」，並同意戴倡否決財案有DQ風險。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾指何桂藍會上自介立場姐姐-何大聲稱肯定冇&quot;&gt;鍾指何桂藍會上自介「立場姐姐」 何大聲稱：肯定冇！&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就新東首次會議情況，鍾稱遲到後戴已稱「不如大家介紹一次自己先啦」，鍾沒有嘗試問人自己錯過什麼，Beel 問是因為他相信會議剛開始嗎？鍾答「我相信個會議冇話冇咗我唔得」，旁聽席傳來笑聲，鍾其後確認沒有問是因感覺會議剛開始。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，鍾是否不記得何桂藍會上有發言，鍾稱「記得佢介紹過自己係『立場姐姐』囉」，惟原本低頭打字的何桂藍即抬頭，瞪着眼睛大聲喊：「肯定冇！」法官陳慶偉着她不要叫囂，何身旁的懲教亦按着其肩膊。鍾頓一頓，再解釋「佢嘗試話人哋叫我係『立場姐姐』」，惟何桂藍即再大喊：「冇！肯定冇！」懲教人員再按其肩膀。Beel 問據鍾記憶所及，這就是何說的話？鍾指「我記得嘅就係呢部份」。Beel 其後問，鍾是否記得何在會上有發言，鍾稱「有嘅，不過我唔記得咗係乜嘢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾指戴耀廷5月底曾提及所有協調已完成及取得共識&quot;&gt;鍾指戴耀廷5月底曾提及所有協調已完成及取得共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，鍾亦確認只曾出席新東首次會議，而會上已就「初選點樣進行」達成共識。至於其他會議的情況，他確認依靠其他人訊息及收取的文件得知。Beel 問主要是由戴耀廷講述？鍾續憶述5月底時，戴曾相約他、程張迎、時任大埔區議會主席關永業及時任北區區議會主席羅庭德，在沙田新城市中央廣場的 Beans 餐廳午膳，除羅庭德外的其他人均有出席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾稱，戴耀廷曾提及「所有嘅初選協調已經完成咗同埋有共識啦」，亦已敲定整個初選流程，戴並望各區議會主席協助找新界東的票站，又提議找黃店做票站。戴又指，若大家都能協助找票站會對大家「最公平」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/iZZ9pBg.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾稱新民主同盟緣起不滿民主黨入中聯辦商政改方案35比雷動計劃目標更明確&quot;&gt;鍾稱新民主同盟緣起不滿民主黨入中聯辦商政改方案、「35+」比「雷動計劃」目標更明確&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾在 Beel 盤問下亦同意，2016年成為民主動力副召集人，而民動當年立法會選舉曾協調，但不成功。Beel 續問，戴同年發起「雷動計劃」，目標是否與2020年相近，即在立會爭取「35+」？鍾稱不肯定當時是爭取「過半議席」抑或「最多嘅議席」，而且當時「更加冇提及到財政預算案嘅問題」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續展示鍾首份供詞，提及「雷動計劃」目標是「爭取民主派於2016年香港立法會選舉取得達半議席」，鍾稱供詞是「較籠統」的說法，並指達半是「理想的情況」，但相較2020年，2016年是沒有這種「大規模」甚至協調功能組別的情況，強調「2020年嘅目標係更加明確」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 其後問，鍾曾加入民主黨，其後加入新民主同盟，問兩黨有何分別。鍾稱「兩句啦」，指「新民主同盟嘅緣起就係不滿當年民主黨進入中聯辦商討政改方案從而通過政改方案」，而兩者理念的不同，是新民主同盟會爭取在一國兩制框架下，政府落實一些「港人優先」的政策。鍾同意民主派有不同政黨，Beel 續問令各政黨走在一起的是否對普選的渴望？即這是各黨均同意的訴求？鍾指「籠統啲講係囉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，李運騰一度問及新東首次協調會議於教協會址的場地設置，鍾解釋是長形的活動室，擺放長枱讓人於兩邊就坐。李問房間有多大，鍾稱「唔識形容」，其後在法官要求下以雙手比劃，指是由法庭的一邊到另一邊，約佔三號法庭面積四分三。法官陳慶偉指是很大的房間，李運騰亦指是大廳（hall）而非房間，鍾稱「教協間房係好大㗎」，故常在該處舉行記招。李問是否可能有人在鍾沒留意下出入，鍾否認，稱「門口得一個」。陳慶偉指20人只佔房間的一小部分，鍾稱「我諗五分四度啦」，林卓廷笑說：「吓？五分之四？」鍾其後同意，會議場地正是6月9日初選記者會的場地，可作參考。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下周一（8日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

Since then, Russia has changed course multiple times, most recently moving to target Ukrainian electrical grid and civilian infrastructure during the winter months. Russia’s haphazard missile campaign reflects both internal strategic failures and Ukraine’s critical forward thinking in the days prior to the invasion. Early Russian failures also gave time for Ukraine to develop its air defense strategy and capabilities which have only grown in effectiveness, thanks in large part to Western aid. This report provides an in-depth review of these and related “missile war” dynamics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology-and-data-sources&quot;&gt;Methodology and Data Sources&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accurately assessing an ongoing war is challenging, and any analysis or narrative deserves a healthy level of skepticism and scrutiny. However, the high level of attention on the war in Ukraine has produced a large quantity of publicly available information. Ukrainian, UK, and U.S. defense and intelligence agencies have provided a steady stream of information on and insights into the performance and availability of Russian missiles and the effects of Russian strike operations. Media reports of major missile attacks and firsthand video and images from the battlespace provide valuable snapshots of events on the ground. Researchers on the ground have also added invaluable insights. When taken together, a rough picture and timeline of the air and missile war have come into view, enabling some preliminary conclusions about the nature of Russia’s long-range strike operations in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data cited and visualized in this report is mainly drawn from several Ukrainian government sources. These include numbers released by the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the Command Staff of the Ukrainian Air Force, and a more detailed data set covering Russian missile strikes between February 28 and July 21 produced by the Staff of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, which Reuters partially published in August 2022. Available information on Russian missile use in Ukraine has evolved, and in some instances, these data do not fully align. As such, readers should consider the data sets presented in this report as estimations and snapshots of general trends instead of hard, independently confirmed numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;key-findings&quot;&gt;Key Findings&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia’s long-range strike campaign of air and missile attacks has fallen short of producing the strategic effects necessary to achieve a decisive victory.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Key drivers of this failure have been the Ukrainian military’s extensive use of dispersion, mobility, and deception and the comparative slowness of Russia’s over-the-horizon targeting cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the war’s outset, Russia significantly underestimated the scale of effort required to accomplish its goals. In its initial operation to gain air superiority, Russia failed to achieve mass and tried to attack too many targets with too few missiles over too short a period to achieve its desired results.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia’s strike campaign has also been undermined by frequent shifts in targeting priorities and the irregular availability of precision-guided munitions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ukrainian air defenses have deterred Russian Air Force aircraft from launching penetrating sorties against strategic targets deep behind the front lines. This success has greatly shaped the course of the war, limiting Russian striking power to diminishing numbers of stand-off missiles or uncrewed aerial systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia’s attacks on Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure and industry have deepened Ukraine’s dependency on the West. This dependency supports Russia’s goal of exhausting the West’s patience and compelling Western capitals to pressure Ukraine to make concessions. This Russian theory of victory will also fail, however, unless Western governments accommodate it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia has seen relatively greater operational success in its campaign to degrade the Ukrainian electrical grid, though Ukraine has proven resilient to these hardships.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ukraine has seen increasing success in intercepting Russian cruise missiles, particularly since the influx of Western air defenses systems in October and November 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ukrainian air and missile defenses have not been leak-proof, however, highlighting the importance of passive defense and maintaining the capacity to quickly reconstitute capabilities and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since the fall of 2022, Russia’s long-range missile attacks against Ukraine have become larger but less frequent as Russia attempts to overcome the growing efficiency of Ukrainian air defenses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia is likely to struggle to maintain the frequency of attacks moving forward as its missile stockpiles diminish and it becomes more reliant on newly produced or recently acquired projectiles to fuel its attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even with a diminished frequency, sustained air attacks against Ukraine’s electrical grid over the long term risk exhausting Ukraine’s capacity to sustain repairs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to degrading Ukraine’s electrical grid, the composition of Russian missile salvos since October 2022 suggests a secondary Russian goal of depleting Ukrainian air defense capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Diminished air defense capacity would not only put Ukraine at greater risk from Russian missile attack but raise the prospects of the Russian Air Force resuming penetrating sorties into Ukrainian airspace.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To the extent possible, replenishing Ukraine’s air defense capacity should remain a priority for Western military aid for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ukraine has demonstrated throughout the war that Russian ballistic and cruise missiles are manageable threats and can be countered effectively through active and passive defenses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since February 2022, Russia has fired thousands of missiles and loitering munitions at Ukraine’s cities, infrastructure, and military forces. These attacks have killed and maimed thousands of Ukrainian civilians and military personnel and have heavily damaged Ukraine’s infrastructure and economy. Russia has had a pronounced advantage over Ukraine in long-range, precision-guided munitions throughout the war. Nevertheless, Russia has struggled to use this advantage to produce the kind of decisive strategic effects that Moscow likely expected to deliver a quick Ukrainian capitulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One year into the war, the Ukrainian military’s command and control apparatus remains intact. Ukraine’s air force and air defenses, while diminished, continue to frustrate Russian air and missile operations. Western weaponry continues to flow to the front lines, and the morale of the Ukrainian people remains steadfast despite enormous hardships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s long-range strike campaign in Ukraine contrasts starkly with those waged by the United States and coalition military forces during Operation Desert Storm and Operation Iraqi Freedom. In these wars, U.S. cruise missiles and other precision-guided munitions played a pivotal role in fracturing Iraq’s military from its political leadership, suppressing enemy air defenses, and achieving coalition air supremacy. These actions contributed directly to the Iraqi military’s quick defeat on the battlefield and the demise of Saddam Hussein’s regime. By contrast, Russia’s inability to achieve similar strategic effects with its guided missiles gave Ukraine the time and breathing room to disperse and reconstitute its forces and repel the main thrust of Russia’s attack in the early phases of the war. Russia’s continued inability to achieve air superiority and disrupt Ukrainian logistics has permitted the Ukrainian Armed Forces to prosecute aggressive counteroffensives with increasingly sophisticated weaponry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a successful strike campaign, one would expect a belligerent to become less dependent on stand-off strike assets over time as it wore down its adversary’s air force and air defenses. Yet Russia has experienced the opposite in Ukraine. Its failure to achieve air superiority in the early phases has caused an increasing dependence on missiles and other stand-off weapons, such as one-way attack drones, to strike targets anywhere beyond the front lines. In this way, Russia has become a victim of the kind of anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) strategies that it itself has sought to develop over many years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the broadest sense, one cannot separate Russia’s haphazard missile campaign against Ukraine from wider strategic failures that have plagued nearly all aspects of Moscow’s war effort. Yet some unique factors have contributed to the underperformance of Russian missile forces. Russia’s intelligence and targeting capabilities have been too slow and inflexible to keep pace with a dynamic, fast-changing battlespace. Russia also underestimated the scale of strike operations needed to accomplish its goals at the beginning of the war, and Ukrainian air defenses have limited the number of Russian missiles reaching their targets. Although the impact of Ukrainian air defenses is difficult to independently confirm, the general trendlines suggest the force is growing more efficient and capable of thinning out Russian missile and drone salvos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While strategically ineffective, Russia’s missile strikes against Ukraine have had tragic consequences. Russian missiles have inflicted their greatest damage against civilian targets, industry, and infrastructure. Since failing to reach its initial objectives, Russia has begun to increasingly target Ukraine’s industry, including Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, defense industrial facilities, and transportation infrastructure. Russia has also attempted to use its stand-off missile capabilities to disrupt the flow of Western weapons and supplies to the front lines, although this effort appears to have failed beyond temporary disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has also used missile attacks as instruments of psychological warfare. These actions have included attacks on civilian targets and possible false-flag operations aimed at degrading support for President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government and demoralizing Ukrainian civilians. Russia has used missile strikes to retaliate after Ukrainian military successes. However, these tactics have failed to break Ukraine’s will to fight. Instead, they may have had the opposite effect, hardening Ukraine’s resolve and amplifying anti-Russian sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the longer term, the damage Russian missiles have inflicted across the country will likely weigh down Ukraine’s economic recovery and make additional foreign assistance critical to rebuilding. However, the continued provision of air defenses now will mitigate these future costs and reinforce a sense of security that could encourage Ukrainian refugees to return home. Such refugee repatriations will be important to Ukraine’s post-war economic recovery and future self-sufficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its struggle against Russian missile attacks, Ukraine has shown that, while dangerous, Russian missiles are not unstoppable. Even under harrowing circumstances, Ukraine has defeated advanced Russian cruise missiles with high-tech counters such as active air defenses and low-tech practices such as dispersion, mobility, deception, and camouflage. One cannot assume that Russia or others would repeat the same operational blunders in a future war. Still, Ukraine’s experience illustrates Russian theater missiles are not an unmanageable challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russias-missile-campaign-in-ukraine&quot;&gt;Russia’s Missile Campaign in Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The character of Russia’s missile attacks on Ukraine has evolved significantly since the start of the war. The first wave of strikes primarily targeted Ukrainian air bases, air defenses, and munitions depots. By around April 2022, Russia shifted its focus from military targets to Ukraine’s petroleum and transportation sectors, aiming to interdict the flow of foreign-supplied weapons to the front lines. The summer of 2022 saw an uptick in Russian missile attacks against civilians, including indiscriminate attacks on residential areas and targeted strikes against Ukraine’s agricultural sector. In September, Russia again escalated its attacks on Ukrainian civilians, kicking off a systemic missile and drone campaign to degrade Ukraine’s civil electrical grid and water facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These shifts in objectives have not been steps in a preplanned military effort. Rather, they represent ad hoc adaptations driven by Russia’s frustrations over its broader war effort, its struggle to target mobile Ukrainian military assets, and the irregular availability of cruise missiles and other stand-off weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-opening-salvo&quot;&gt;The Opening Salvo&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first hours of its attack on Ukraine, Russia concentrated its air and guided-missile strikes against Ukrainian airfields and airports, with particular attention to on-site stores of aviation fuel. Russia also targeted air defense sites and major Ukrainian munitions depots (Appendix I). Moscow carried out around 160 air and missile strikes in the first two days of the war, with missiles striking “nearly 10” Ukrainian air bases, among other targets, according to U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) estimates at the time. Ukraine reported explosions at around 30 locations by 0900 on February 24. At the time, the Russian Ministry of Defense characterized these strikes as targeting “military infrastructure, air defense facilities, military airfields, and aviation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine” using “high-precision weapons.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aggregate effect of these strikes was not immediately clear from open sources, but it soon became apparent that Russia was failing to gain air superiority over Ukraine. While Russia struck nearly all of Ukraine’s active air bases, much of the Ukrainian Air Force (UAF) survived the initial barrage and, despite being badly outnumbered and outclassed, made its presence felt in the days and weeks following the invasion. Ukrainian fighters persistently engaged Russian aircraft in the skies of Kyiv and elsewhere. Even on the first day of war, Ukrainian Su-24 bombers took part in the Battle of Hostomel airport, an early Ukrainian victory that set the tone for the early phases of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than two weeks into the war, the DOD assessed that the “Ukrainians still have at their disposal viable and effective air and missile defense, and they are still able to and are flying aircraft in that very contested airspace.” While Russia could gain dominance over some areas for periods, airspace control was shifting and heavily contested. In addition to the tactical advantages, the persistence of the UAF also proved a valuable symbol for national morale and resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important factor in these early days was the failure of Russian missile forces to suppress Ukraine’s contingent of Bayraktar TB-2 uncrewed aerial systems, which Ukraine likely also dispersed in advance of the invasion. Although Russia would eventually neutralize most of these systems through electronic warfare and air defenses, the TB-2s proved pivotal in the early weeks of the war, inflicting considerable damage to Russian forces. Video footage gathered by TB-2s circulated across social media sites, proving a powerful tool in publicizing Ukrainian military success to the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia saw some initial success in disabling fixed Ukrainian air defense sites in the opening days of the war. A study from the Royal United Services Institute found that Russia managed to suppress Ukrainian air defense through air and missile strikes on static air defense targets, particularly Ukraine’s network of larger air surveillance radars. However, a significant portion of Ukraine’s mobile air defenses survived. Once reconstituted after the initial few days of the war, these units began inflicting high losses on Russian aircraft operating in Ukrainian airspace. By March, the Russian Air Force had largely abandoned penetrating sorties with manned aircraft, relying predominately on stand-off missiles for strike missions against strategic targets beyond the front lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another pivotal shortcoming in Russia’s opening salvo was its failure to decisively diminish Ukraine’s munitions stockpiles. According to one account, Russian missiles struck all of Ukraine’s national munitions depots in the first days of the war. However, Ukraine had already begun dispersing its munitions stores away from the centralized sites three days before the start of Russia’s invasion. Russia’s apparent inability to adapt its targeting to this dispersal enabled Ukraine to keep its artillery brigades well supplied with shells. Russian forces attempting to advance against Kyiv faced bombardment from Ukrainian artillery until they retreated from the Kyiv axis altogether in April 2022. Dispersal of artillery units in the days leading up to the invasion was also instrumental in ensuring the guns themselves survived the initial Russian air attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;shifting-focus&quot;&gt;Shifting Focus&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Russia abandoned its drive against Kyiv in April, Russia deemphasized targeting Ukraine’s military airfields and air defenses and refocused on economic and logistical targets. In addition to rail infrastructure and bridges, Russia targeted Ukraine’s petroleum industry to degrade its ability to produce fuel (Appendix II). This shift in focus likely stemmed from Russia’s realization that it was facing a protracted conflict and needed to stymie Ukraine’s mobility and supply lines. Neither line of effort appears to have achieved lasting effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early April, Russia attacked Ukraine’s largest oil refineries, in Kremenchuk and Odesa. Local sources said Russian missiles had “completely destroyed” the Kremenchuk refinery, although Russia would go on to strike the facility again in May and June. Russia also reportedly struck the Shebelinsky gas processing plant in June, and missile strikes also damaged pipeline infrastructure. Together, these attacks effectively shut down Ukraine’s domestic production of refined petroleum products such as gasoline and likely contributed to a temporary gasoline shortage over the spring and summer of 2022. While this resulted in hardships among civilians, it did not discernably impair Ukraine’s military effort. Ukraine was already heavily dependent (more than 80 percent) on imports of refined petroleum products even before the war, and countries such as Lithuania were quick to step up their exports to Ukraine to meet the shortfall from Russian attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/fdTajRW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Workers look at a power substation damaged following a missile strike in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv on May 4, 2022, as Russia’s defense ministry said that its air- and sea-based weapons have destroyed six electrical substations near railways, including around Lviv.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia also took aim at Ukraine’s transportation infrastructure in a bid to disrupt the flow of Western weapons to the front lines. On April 25, Russian missiles hit five railway junctions in a single day, with the Ukrainian General Staff assessing: “They [the Russians] are trying to destroy the ways of supplying military and technical assistance from partner states.” A week later, at least 18 Russian cruise missiles struck railway infrastructure across Ukraine, including damaging three electrical substations around Lviv powering the rail network in Western Ukraine. These attacks reportedly caused temporary delays to around 50 trains. Like previous efforts to achieve decisive strategic effects, Russian attacks against Ukraine’s transportation did not appear to have had a lasting impact. Even shortly after the strikes, a top executive of Ukraine’s rail services told journalists that “the longest delay we’ve had has been less than an hour.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;false-flags-punishment-and-psychological-warfare&quot;&gt;FALSE FLAGS, PUNISHMENT, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the start of the war, there have been multiple examples of Russia attempting to use missile attacks to shape public opinion in its favor or to psychologically influence the calculus of Ukraine’s leadership. These efforts have generally backfired. One incident was Russia’s ballistic missile attack on the Kramatorsk railway station, which killed nearly 60 civilians and wounded more than 100 others. In the attack, Russia employed older SS-21 Tochka-U ballistic missiles equipped with submunition warheads. The Tochka-U is the only ballistic missile system Russia and Ukraine possess in common, and in the wake of the attack, Russia pushed the narrative that Ukraine had carried out a false-flag attack to gain international sympathy. An independent investigation debunked these claims, however, confirming that Russia still had SS-21s in service in Ukraine and that the missile that struck Kramatorsk came from Russian-occupied territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/z43WCEI.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ The remains of a rocket with the Russian lettering “for our children” painted on it is seen on the ground in the aftermath of a rocket attack on the railway station in the eastern city of Kramatorsk on April 8, 2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier in March 2022, a Tochka-U missile with submunitions struck downtown Donetsk city, killing over 20 civilians. Unlike the Kramatorsk attack, this attack occurred inside Russian-occupied territory. Russian media presented the incident as a Ukrainian attack, an accusation that Ukraine denied, saying that the missile was of Russian origin. Neither version of the story has been fully confirmed, but the incident aligns with the pattern of Russian behavior since the start of the war. In October 2022, projectiles struck the Continent shopping mall in downtown Donetsk. Russian sources accused Ukraine of attacking the civilian structure with HIMARS rockets. Later, however, imagery emerged of debris from a Russian Kh-31 missile at the site of the blast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the war has turned against Russia, Moscow has also used its long-range missiles in operations meant to “punish” Ukraine in the wake of major Russian setbacks, an effort to deter Ukraine from its continued counterattacks. After Ukraine sank the Russian cruiser Moskva in April, Russia responded by firing up to five cruise missiles at the Vizar Zhulyansky Machine-Building Plant, a defense industrial complex outside of Kyiv. After the attack, Russia’s defense ministry declared that: “The number and scale of missile strikes on targets in Kyiv will increase in response to any terrorist attacks or acts of sabotage on Russian territory committed by the Kyiv nationalist regime.” In late June, Russia launched more than 60 missile strikes against cities across Ukraine over two days, possibly a response to the United States announcing it would send HIMARS to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;escalation-against-civilians&quot;&gt;Escalation against Civilians&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attacks on civilians have been a persistent feature of Russia’s war on Ukraine since the start of the conflict. But by the summer of 2022, there was a noticeable uptick in civilian attacks using long-range missiles (Appendix III). There has been a degree of uncertainty as to whether civilians were the intended target of these attacks or whether the loss of civilian life and destruction of civilian property has been a byproduct of inaccurate Russian missiles and poor targeting intelligence. Evidence is mixed, and it is likely that Russia has targeted Ukrainian civilians both intentionally and inadvertently. Whether purposeful or not, Russia’s strike campaign has shown an almost complete disregard for civilian safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The elevated intensity of strikes against civilian targets around mid-summer 2022 coincided with reports that Russia was running low on its higher-end precision-guided missiles such as the 3M-14 and Kh-101, relying more heavily on missiles ill-suited for land-attack missions. This period included growing Russian use of anti-ship missiles in land-attack roles, such as the Kh-22. Missiles such as the Kh-22 have seekers able to home in on large ships at sea and struggle to discriminate between structures in dense urban environments. Kh-22s nevertheless have large warheads and have had devasting effects on civilian infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia also began repurposing S-300 air defense interceptors to strike urban areas at this time. S-300 interceptors are also poorly suited for land attack as they rely on semi-active radar homing for terminal guidance. In a social media post, the governor of Mykolaiv Oblast, Vitaly Kim, noted that Russia had been upgrading its S-300 with satellite navigation, though their accuracy remained poor. Mykolaiv was hit uniquely hard by Russian S-300 barrages during the summer of 2022, with salvos of 9 to 12 missiles striking the city every few days during some periods. Commenting on Russia’s use of the S-300 in late July, UK intelligence assessed: “There is a high chance of these weapons missing their intended targets and causing civilian casualties because the missiles are not optimized for this role and their crews will have little training for such missions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s use of anti-ship missiles against urban centers has had similar outcomes. On June 27, Russia struck the city of Kremenchuk with Kh-22s. In Kremenchuk, one Kh-22 struck a road-paving equipment factory, while another hit a nearby shopping mall, killing 20 civilians and wounding more than 60 others. On July 1, three Russian Kh-22s struck the city of Odesa, demolishing a multi-story apartment complex and killing 22 civilians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The toll that Russian missile strikes have taken on Ukrainian civilians cannot be solely attributed to low-quality munitions. Russia has, on numerous occasions, struck civilian targets with some of its most advanced and expensive weapons. On July 14, for example, three Russian submarine-launched 3M-14 Kalibr cruise missiles struck downtown Vinnytsia, hitting a shopping center, a wedding hall, and a dance studio, killing 23 civilians and wounding 71. Such strikes have led many to conclude that Russian strikes on civilians are intentional, not a byproduct of missile inaccuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/0M28fWc.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Fragments of a Russian cruise missile lie on the ground following a strike in the city of Vinnytsia on July 14, 2022, killing at least 23 people, including 3 children.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This period also saw significant Russian targeting of Ukraine’s agricultural sector. To be sure, Russia’s military has sought to damage Ukraine’s agricultural industry since just after the start of the conflict. Yet as Russian troops withdrew from northern Ukraine, Russia continued to attack agricultural infrastructure with artillery and stand-off missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late August, reports surfaced that Russia had received shipments from Iran comprising “hundreds” of Iranian Shahed-series loitering munitions, sometimes referred to as “kamikaze” or one-way attack drones. By mid-September, UK intelligence had assessed that Russia had already deployed Shahed-136 drones, after Ukrainian forces reportedly shot one down on September 13.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By late September, Shahed-136 munitions began appearing in the skies over Odesa. In the following weeks, intense battles ensued between Ukrainian air defenses and Russian drones attacking civilian and military structures. Between September 25 and 29, Russia reportedly launched 29 kamikaze drone attacks against Odesa and other areas in southern Ukraine. By most accounts, Ukrainian air defenses destroyed a significant portion of Russia’s drone attacks. Some did get through, however, with Shahed-136 drones striking Odesa’s port area, several residential areas, and the headquarters of Ukraine’s Operational Command South.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-autumn-blitz&quot;&gt;The Autumn Blitz&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian missile attacks on Ukraine entered a new phase shortly after Ukraine’s October 8 attack on the Kerch bridge connecting Crimea to Russia. On October 10, Russia launched over 100 missiles and loitering munitions at Ukraine, targeting Ukraine’s power grid, municipal water facilities, and related civilian infrastructure. This wave of attacks would become just the first in a systematic Russian effort to degrade Ukraine’s capacity to produce and deliver electrical power to its civilian population (Appendix IV).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/YX0qMJy.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Damaged equipment at a high-voltage substation of the operator Ukrenergo after a missile attack in central Ukraine on November 10, 2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first week of the renewed assault, Russian missiles and drones struck 405 locations across the country, including 45 power stations, representing approximately 30 percent of power stations across Ukraine. In a briefing on October 17, a senior DOD official described Russian actions as “targeting nonmilitary targets, innocent civilians, with no military value . . . to instill terror, and try to create panic, fear, with the idea that somehow this is going to decrease the resolve of the Ukrainian people.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following days and weeks would see steady waves of missile and drone attacks of an intensity not seen since the conflict’s opening days. According to reports from the UAF, Russia fired over 600 air- and sea-launched cruise missiles between October 10 and the end of 2022, with an average salvo size of around 50 missiles. Interspersed with these cruise missile attacks have been waves of one-way attack drones, primarily Shahed-136s, of which Ukraine says Russia launched nearly 700 between September 2022 and early January 2023. Moreover, Russia has targeted civilian infrastructure with shorter-range missiles such as the S-300 in areas closer to the front lines, including Kherson and Mykolaiv. In mid-December, the United Nations assessed that Russia’s bombardment had damaged around 50 percent of Ukraine’s power grid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evidence suggests that Ukraine has managed to forestall a complete collapse of its electrical grid. Independent measures of internet connectivity across Ukraine, a proxy measure for electricity supply, show the damage caused by Russia’s strikes but also Ukraine’s efforts to restore power. Data from the independent internet watchdog Netblocks, for example, shows a major drop in web connectivity during the first major wave of strikes against Ukraine’s grid between October 10 and 11, but also shows restoration of service in many areas (Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observers measured similar outages corresponding to Russian missile attacks. Attacks on November 15 and 23 resulted in particularly acute losses in power as they also caused disruptions to the output from all three of Ukraine’s nuclear power plants still in operation. Ukrainian utilities have employed conservation efforts and scheduled rolling blackouts to ration what power they can still generate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-view-ahead&quot;&gt;The View Ahead&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of January 2023, Russian missile and drone attacks against electrical infrastructure have caused significant degradation of Ukraine’s grid. The system remains fragile, but Ukrainian air defense and utility workers have prevented a total grid collapse. As of mid-January, Ukraine’s main energy company, Ukenergo, said it could cover 75 percent of its electricity demand. Ukrainians face extreme hardship, but there appears to be little public support for offering concessions to Russia in exchange for peace. The growing capability of Ukrainian air defenses have likely forced Russia into making less frequent but more intense attacks to overwhelm defenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The availability of Russian stand-off weapons will be a factor as well in the frequency and intensity of Russian attacks. Analysis of the wreckage of Kh-101s from the attacks on November 23 shows they were produced no earlier than September 2022. This indicates that Russia may be reaching the limits of its missile stockpiles and shifting toward greater reliance on newly manufactured missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Russia has truly exhausted its stockpiles, a slowdown in attacks could be on the horizon. Since October, Russia has expended more high-end precision missiles than most estimates suggest it can produce. Ukraine estimates that Russia has produced around 500 long-range cruise missiles since the start of the war, or around 40 to 50 per month. It is unclear whether Russia can sustain such production levels, considering that the impact of Western sanctions and export restrictions on component availability is murky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, Russian missile expenditure and production will have to reach an equilibrium at some point. If Russia cannot significantly increase production, it will have to decrease the frequency of its large missile attacks to perhaps one to two per month. Russia may continue to acquire and employ Iranian Shahed-136 drones, though very few of these appear to be getting through Ukrainian air defenses and therefore are unlikely to inflict considerable harm beyond draining Ukraine’s air defense capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the threat of a diminished Ukrainian air defense capacity is a great concern. Beyond intercepting cruise missiles and drones, Ukraine’s long-, medium-, and short-range defenses have, in concert, successfully stopped and deterred penetrating sorties by Russian aircraft. It is therefore critical that Ukraine maintains a layered air defense to prevent Russia from making use of its deep stockpiles of unguided gravity bombs. Should Russia manage to wear down Ukraine’s air defenses through attrition and gain air superiority, the war becomes significantly more challenging for Ukraine. To the extent possible, the replenishment of interceptors and related air defense equipment must remain a high priority for Western military aid packages for the foreseeable future. Sourcing will grow increasingly difficult, however, and will likely require ramping up production to maintain adequate inventories among U.S. and allied militaries.&lt;/p&gt;

Currently, stabilization schedules (SGS) are in effect. You can familiarize yourself with the schedule here. Take care and use electricity sparingly! We believe in victory.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another concern is if Russia is able to sustain air attacks against Ukraine’s electrical grid over the coming months or even years, even at a diminished frequency, it could eventually exhaust Ukraine’s capacity to sustain repairs. Ukraine’s grid is based on Soviet technology, for which there are few sources for spare parts and materials. In addition to continued air defense support, it will likely become necessary for Ukraine to transition its electrical infrastructure to a more sustainable configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It cannot be denied that Russia’s attacks on Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure and industry have deepened Ukraine’s dependency on the West. This growing dependency supports Russia’s hope that it can eventually exhaust the West’s patience and Western capitals will pressure Ukraine to make concessions. This Russian theory of victory will fail, however, unless Western governments accommodate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sources-of-underperformance&quot;&gt;Sources of Underperformance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of February 2023, Russia’s long-range strike campaign has fallen short of most of its strategic objectives. At the war’s outset, the Russian military failed to sufficiently degrade Ukraine’s air force and air defenses enough to sustain air superiority. Moscow struggled to disrupt Ukraine’s command and control apparatus and could not isolate its political leadership. Russian efforts to disrupt Ukrainian logistics through attacks on munitions depots and transportation infrastructure have not achieved lasting effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There appears to be no single reason for these missteps. Instead, a confluence of factors explains the underperformance of Russia’s strike campaign. Among these are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s efforts to disperse its forces in advance of the initial wave of attacks and the inability of Russia’s targeting cycle to keep pace with a dynamic and shifting battlespace;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia’s inability to adequately scale its strike campaign to the volume of targets Ukraine has presented;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ukrainian air defenses and their increasing effectiveness in reducing damage from Russian missile salvos; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lower-than-expected reliability of Russian missiles may have also been a factor. However, this point is somewhat controversial as it is difficult to assess the extent to which Russian missiles have failed due to malfunctions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October 2022, Russia began a brute-force effort to break the morale of Ukrainian civilians through long-range missile and drone attacks on electrical infrastructure. This operation’s myopic focus and persistence have resulted in major damage to Ukraine’s civil infrastructure. The current campaign’s target set of fixed assets fits better with Russian operational capabilities. Russian missile forces have struggled with mobile targets, but infrastructure is generally immovable and unhardened. Moreover, Ukraine’s civil infrastructure has changed little since the country gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, and thus Russian intelligence on Ukraine’s critical infrastructure remains accurate. Whether these attacks will advance Russia’s aim to drive the Ukrainian government into trading concessions for peace remains to be seen, but if the history of strategic bombing of civilians is a guide, Russia’s current campaign is unlikely to achieve its political objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;dispersal-of-forces-and-slow-russian-targeting-cycles&quot;&gt;Dispersal of Forces and Slow Russian Targeting Cycles&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dispersal and mobility have been Ukraine’s best tools against Russia’s strike operations. Russia has seen some success against fixed targets, such as static air defense assets at the war’s outset, and more recently against fixed infrastructure, such as electrical substations. In general, the Russian military appears to have struggled to gather and disseminate targeting data quickly enough to keep pace with a dynamic battlespace. From the onset of the war, easily movable assets such as mobile air defenses, aircraft, and other maneuver forces have largely eluded Russia’s long-range air and missile attacks. Ukrainian officials have assessed that it can take the Russian military 48 hours or more between the acquisition of targeting intelligence and a strike, leaving adequate time for Ukrainian forces to shift locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The apparent slowness of Russia’s targeting practices suggests that Russia may lack a targeting process nimble enough to quickly shift attack capability to high-priority targets or simply may lack the capacity to dedicate attack capability solely for time-sensitive targets. Russia may likewise lack a command and control process to rapidly direct changes in strike plans. UK intelligence similarly assessed that “Russia’s targeting processes are highly likely routinely undermined by dated intelligence, poor planning, and a top-down approach to operations.” Analysts from Royal United Services Institute also highlighted the effects of the Russian command structure’s inflexibility on its strike operations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It seems that those directing fire missions either do not have access to contextual information or are indifferent to it. In any case, observations of Russian pre-planned fires shows that they will strike targets that have moved and subsequently engage the same target in its new position, suggesting a purely chronological prioritization of activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such deficiencies have had a major impact on the course of the war. One clear example comes from the degree to which Ukraine’s small air force survived Russia’s initial aerial onslaught. In September, a top U.S. military commander estimated that around 80 percent of Ukraine’s air force remained intact. And while the UAF has taken losses in air-to-air combat, there is no evidence that Ukraine has lost significant numbers of operational combat aircraft on the ground. This achievement is due in no small way to dispersal actions that have complicated Russian targeting. Despite the small size of its air force, Ukraine has a significant number of air bases capable of receiving military aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of this spare capacity may be due to the degradation of the UAF since 2014. But the UAF has been conscious of maintaining spare basing capacity. For instance, the UAF’s strategic plan published in 2020 noted that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In peacetime, in order to save resources, aviation should be based at 5-6 aviation bases, which will reduce operational costs. At the same time, to ensure operational maneuver, operational flexibility, and survivability, up to 15-20 operational airfields (aviation garrisons) should be sustained. These will be capable of receiving aircraft and helicopters immediately and ensuring their combat employment, allowing them to disperse aviation equipment to threatening axes during special periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dispersion and mobility were also crucial in enabling a decisive amount of Ukraine’s air defenses to survive Russian efforts to gain air superiority. While Russia may have destroyed as much as 75 percent of Ukraine’s fixed air defenses in its initial bombardment, Ukraine’s mobile, dispersible units largely survived. These forces have had an enormous impact in setting conditions for Ukraine’s military success so far. As of December 2022, Russia had lost at least 62 combat aircraft, mostly the work of mobile ground-based defenses. More importantly, though, the threat from Ukrainian air defenses has deterred the Russian Air Force from penetrating sorties into Ukraine’s airspace for most of the war, restricting Russia’s strategic strike campaign to a limited number of expensive stand-off missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;too-many-targets-too-few-missiles&quot;&gt;Too Many Targets, Too Few Missiles&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has unleashed thousands of missiles upon Ukraine since February 2022. In many cases, it appears that Russian planners underestimated the amount of ordnance required to adequately suppress the facilities they targeted, particularly in the critical early days of the invasion. The sheer volume of individual targets within Ukraine likely strained Russia’s strike capacity. Ukrainian statistics of Russian missile strikes over the first five months of the war show a lower-than-expected density of strikes in areas of Ukraine rich in strategic military targets (Figure 5). Moreover, the time Russia allotted for its initial strike campaign was also far too short for what it hoped to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/AgkbqHS.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 5: Russian Missile Strikes by Region, February 24 – July 21, 2022.&lt;/strong&gt; Note: Data set included 110 additional strikes with undetermined target region. Source: Data from Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian figures indicate as few as 20 Russian missile strikes in Vinnytsia Oblast between February 22 and July 21. This is an unexpectedly low number considering that Vinnytsia Oblast is home to numerous strategic facilities, including Ukraine’s Air Force Command Center and an important UAF weapons depot. It also contains Vinnytsia International Airport, a major Ukrainian military logistics hub, and is home to the 456th Guards Transport Aviation Brigade. The airport remained unscathed until Russia struck it with eight Kh-101 cruise missiles on March 6. Satellite imagery indicated that damage was limited to two air traffic control towers and a single parked aircraft, with no apparent damage to the runway. Russia did not strike the UAF command center until March 25, by which time it is unlikely the facility still served any critical wartime functions. Ukraine has also reported several missile attacks on civilian areas with no apparent strategic or military value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other strategic targets appeared to suffer only light-to-moderate damage early in the conflict, allowing Ukraine to disperse forces and reconstitute. Ozerne Air Base in Zhytomyr Oblast is a good example. At the start of the war, Ozerne was home to Ukraine’s 39th Tactical Aviation Brigade, which includes around 15 Su-27 multirole fighters, representing about 10 percent of Ukraine’s combat air power at the start of the war. Ozerne was struck by Russian missiles on the first day of the conflict, February 24. However, satellite imagery of Ozerne from February 27 showed signs of only seven impact points. Five of these strikes appear to have missed any vital assets. Two struck around the apron, destroying one parked Su-27 (one of two aircraft visible in the image). Other reports say that a fueling vehicle may have also been destroyed. The runway remained intact. Only two aircraft are visible in the image, likely indicating that the remaining aircraft had been dispersed to other bases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The apparent intensity of Russian missile attacks in these cases is well below similar operations conducted by the United States and its allies against similar targets. Over the first three days of its invasion of Ukraine, Russia launched around 250 cruise and ballistic missiles at targets across the entire territory of Ukraine. By comparison, the United States launched more than 420 sea- and air-launched cruise missiles against Iraq over 70 hours during Operation Desert Fox in 1998, an operation with vastly narrower objectives. Over the first 10 days of Operation Iraqi Freedom, U.S. and coalition forces delivered nearly 10,000 precision-guided munitions against Iraqi military targets. By day 10 of its invasion of Ukraine, Russia had launched under 1,000 precision strikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of munitions Russia employed against individual targets is also significantly less than the United States has employed against similar targets. To the previous examples, reports indicate that the Russia struck the Ozerne and Vinnytsia Air Bases with no more than eight cruise missiles each (the loadout of a single Tu-95 bomber). In response to the Assad regime’s use of chemical weapons in 2017, the United States struck a single Syrian air base with 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of strikes Russia carried out seems even less adequate when one considers the sheer volume of targets that Russia would have to suppress to gain air superiority over Ukraine. In addition to the number of air bases capable of servicing military aircraft, Ukraine had the largest ground-based air defense force in Europe at the start of the invasion. Estimates from 2021 indicated that Ukraine possessed over 300 mobile medium- to long-range air defense systems. Additionally, Ukraine had multiple static air defense radars and older interceptors, such as S-125 units, deployed across its territory. Even with timely intelligence, quickly disabling a large enough portion to gain control of the skies may simply have outstripped the capacity of Russia’s conventional strike complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time was also a factor. For an operation as large and complex as Russia’s invasion, Russian military planners gave its aerospace forces essentially no time to shape the battlespace prior to commencing its invasion. By comparison, U.S. operations against Iraq in 1991 and 2003 saw days to weeks of aerial bombardment before committing coalition ground forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ukrainian-air-defenses&quot;&gt;Ukrainian Air Defenses&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another increasingly important factor contributing to Russia’s underperformance has been the ability of Ukrainian air defenses to intercept Russian missiles and other guided munitions in flight. The UAF, which operates much of Ukraine’s long-range air defense systems, regularly reports on air defense activity. Although difficult to verify, the number of reported intercepts has significantly increased since Russia began systematically targeting civilian power facilities on October 10 (Figure 6). This increase is on one hand a function of the relatively greater volume of missiles Russia is firing into Ukraine but is also likely due to the introduction of Western air defense systems since the fall of 2022. Data shows not just an increase in the gross number of intercepts but in the proportion of salvos that Ukraine reports to shoot down (Figure 7).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/r6OUMwz.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 6: Reported Cruise Missile Intercepts (Cumulative).&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Data from General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The backbone of Ukraine’s air defense force at the start of the war was its mobile SA-8, SA-10, and SA-11 units, most of which survived the opening salvo of Russia’s strike campaign. Since then, this layered defense has provided a potent deterrent against Russian aircraft making penetrating sorties into Ukrainian airspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Videos and images of cruise missile intercepts in Ukraine have been rare, but this lack of video or photo evidence of cruise missile intercepts is an unreliable indicator of Ukrainian air defense performance against cruise missiles. The speed and suddenness of air defense engagements make documenting the events challenging. The Ukrainian government also discourages its citizens from posting about air defense activity for operational security reasons. There have, however, been enough documented incidents of cruise missile intercepts to confirm that Ukrainian air defenses are actively engaging Russian cruise missiles and are seeing some success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. defense officials have also lent additional credence to Ukrainian reports by confirming that Ukraine has successfully stopped at least some Russian cruise missiles. In October, a senior defense official said that between October 10 and 11, Ukraine intercepted 40 to 50 percent of the 80 Russian cruise missiles and drones fired at its territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/NrE16Tb.png&quot; alt=&quot;image12&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Ukrainian BUK-M1 medium-range surface-to-air missile system.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numbers published by the UAF show that its air defenses are intercepting an increasingly large proportion of Russian cruise missile salvos since October. Moreover, the intercept ratios Ukrainian air defenders achieved in the latter months of 2022 were markedly greater than during the first several months of the war. Between February and July, Ukraine reported intercepting 174 cruise missiles, just over 10 percent of Russia’s reported 1,500 cruise missiles fired into Ukraine by that point. By December 2022, Ukraine reported intercepting 75 to 80 percent of incoming Russian cruise missiles on average (Figure 7). On November 15, Ukraine claimed to stop 75 cruise missiles in a single day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/EBOX9G1.png&quot; alt=&quot;image13&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ German-made IRIS-T surface-to-air missile system in Ukraine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This growth is likely attributable to several factors. While difficult to measure, the growing experience and skill of Ukraine’s air defenders is very likely an important factor. Moreover, Russia’s almost singular focus on electrical infrastructure since October has also made its targeting more predictable, allowing Ukraine to optimally posture its air defense assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1jXxsDs.png&quot; alt=&quot;image14&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The increase in reported intercepts also roughly correlates to the arrival of Western-made air defenses such as IRIS-T, NASAMS, and Aspide. Ukrainian leaders have stated that the IRIS-T system has succeeded in 90 percent of engagements. In November, U.S. secretary of defense Lloyd Austin said that NASAMS had achieved a 100 percent success rate. These systems, however, are not yet widespread in Ukraine, and legacy systems such as the S-300 likely remain the workhorses of Ukraine’s air defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/46eN3Of.png&quot; alt=&quot;image15&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Damage from air defense interceptor on body of downed 3M-14 Kalibr cruise missile, June 2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the longer-range systems such as NASAMS, Ukraine has also highlighted its successful employment of shorter-range missile and gun-based systems, such as the German-made Gepard. The Gepard features two 35-mm Flak cannons and a radar mounted on a tracked chassis. Systems such as the Gepard are playing an important role in engaging slower-moving targets such as Shahed-136 drones, allowing Ukrainian air defenders to preserve their limited supply of surface-to-air missiles for faster, more challenging targets. Still, some observers have credited the Gepard with destroying higher-end targets, including cruise missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A profile from Ukrainian defense media highlighted the role of mobile fire groups equipped with man-portable air defense weapons (MANPADS) such as Igla and Stinger missiles, crediting them with downing an undisclosed number of cruise missiles. These groups reportedly operate across the country, dispatched to interdict missiles and other aerial targets as they are detected. Several videos of MANPADS intercepting cruise missiles have surfaced on social media, indicating that the UAF is seeing some success with this tactic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/76bJxqX.png&quot; alt=&quot;image16&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Ukrainian soldier Igor, who reportedly shot down a Russian cruise missile with a man-portable air defense system in the Lviv region on October 10, 2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet challenges lie ahead. For Ukraine to sustain this apparent success, it will require continued Western support. The high volume of air defense activity has no doubt strained the capacity of Ukrainian air defenses, and Russian tactics appear to be aimed precisely to drain Ukraine’s defense capacity. Russia has reportedly been disarming some of its nuclear Kh-55 cruise missiles and firing them into Ukraine with ballast payloads to absorb air defense fire. Russia has also sought to maximize air defense attrition by launching mixed salvos of high-end cruise missiles and inexpensive drones. In some cases, Russia has used drones as pathfinders, probing for gaps and absorbing fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of cheaper air defense systems, such as gun-based weapons, has helped Ukraine mount a more efficient defense against low-end threats. But Russia’s mixed salvos present a complex battle management problem. Ukraine’s set of Russian and Western air defenses, old and new, lack an integrated battlement management system. Ukrainian air defenders are instead likely relying on wireless communications and “swivel chair integration” to build a common air picture and coordinate engagements. Under these conditions, a certain number of suboptimal exchanges and interceptor wastage is inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/AUx2sdh.png&quot; alt=&quot;image17&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ A Flakpanzer Gepard antiaircraft gun (vehicle seen in image) shoots down a Russian cruise missile.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another consideration for Ukraine is balancing the air defense needs of civilian infrastructure with the need to protect its troops on the front lines from aerial attacks. Ukrainian air defenses along the front lines face a similar or even greater pace of activity. Russian attack aircraft and helicopters operate along the front lines daily, and the UAF regularly reports downing Russian aircraft and helicopters, including 14 Su-24 and Su-25 attack aircraft in 2022. Should Ukraine’s air defenses wither over the coming year, this balancing act becomes harder, increasing the vulnerability of Ukrainian troops to air attack, which could even reverse the momentum of the war in Russia’s favor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9PkGJyK.png&quot; alt=&quot;image18&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Ukraine shifts toward greater reliance on Western systems, it will become increasingly dependent on Western military aid to replenish stocks of interceptors and other related munitions and equipment. Ukraine faces two main aerial threats: (1) the acute threat of Russian missiles and drones, and (2) the latent threat of the Russian Air Force resuming penetrating sorties into Ukrainian airspace. Consistent Western support over 2023 and beyond will be necessary for Ukraine to manage both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;accuracy-and-reliability&quot;&gt;Accuracy and Reliability&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the start of the war, there has been speculation that Russian missiles have experienced higher-than-expected failure rates and lower-than-expected accuracy. The evidence is mixed and inconclusive on this point, however. In March 2022, news media quoted a U.S. official saying that U.S. intelligence had assessed that some types of Russian missiles were seeing failure rates of up to 60 percent and that Russia’s air-launched cruise missiles were particularly affected. Also in March, a DOD official told reporters that Russia had suffered a “not-insignificant number of failures” of cruise missiles. “Either they’re failing to launch, or they’re failing to hit the target, or they’re failing to explode on contact,” the official said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Little imagery has surfaced of Russian cruise missiles that failed to detonate, so it is difficult to corroborate this point with open-source evidence. There has been a steady amount of visual evidence showing Russian cruise missiles crashing before reaching their targets. Yet all missile systems will experience a certain failure rate, so evidence of crashed cruise missiles does not necessarily indicate systemic problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been speculation that Russian missiles have proven less accurate than previously thought. There have been instances of Russian missiles missing targets, such as the satellite image of the aftermath of a missile strike on the Ozerne air base where most missiles failed to hit any base structures. In other instances, Russian missiles visibly struck targets, including air traffic control towers and radar sites, with some precision. The most recent phase of Russia’s strike campaign, its attack on Ukraine’s electrical grid, suggests that Russian cruise missiles are capable of precise attacks. Satellite imagery and social media posts show clear evidence that Russian missiles are effectively hitting and damaging Ukraine’s electrical infrastructure. Furthermore, Russia is seeing this success despite having its salvos significantly thinned out by Ukrainian air defenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be sure, Russia has employed hundreds of projectiles with poor accuracy in land-attack roles, such as Kh-22 anti-ship missiles and S-300 interceptors. These weapons have largely been limited to area attacks or indiscriminate terror attacks on civilians. But among the vanguard of Russia’s precision-guided munitions, such as the Kh-101 and 3M-14 Kalibr, the picture emerging from Ukraine is that these weapons, while perhaps not always reliably accurate, are not reliably inaccurate either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-russia-is-using&quot;&gt;What Russia Is Using&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since February 2022, Russian armed forces have employed well over 5,000 missiles and one-way attack drones against Ukraine and nearly every known type of conventional missile in their arsenal. According to various data sets from the Ukrainian government, most of these projectiles have been air-launched, with smaller proportions fired from ground- and sea-based platforms. Comparing earlier and later data sets suggests that Russia leaned more heavily on its ground- and sea-based strike systems in the latter half of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has expended much of its pre-war stockpile of precision-guided missiles. Shortages of modern missiles have forced Russia to reach deeper into its stocks of older missiles or to repurpose anti-ship missiles and air defense interceptors for land-attack roles. Still, Russia continues to use more modern missile variants such as the Kh-101 and 3M-14 Kalibr, indicating that it maintains some quantity in reserve and that newly manufactured missiles are making their way into the theater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;air-launched&quot;&gt;Air-Launched&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air-launched missiles represent the largest and most diverse portion of Russian missiles used in Ukraine, comprising a mix of long- and short-range air-launched cruise missiles (ALCMs) and a variety of shorter-range air-to-surface rockets. Data from the Ukrainian government indicates that Russia fired over 2,700 air-launched missiles during the first five months of the war. Of these, roughly half came from aircraft outside of Ukrainian airspace, suggesting that the remaining missiles were likely shorter-range projectiles supporting close air support operations around the front lines in Luhansk, Donetsk, and Kharkiv (Figure 12). This assessment would track with comments by DOD officials in May 2022. Following Russia’s withdrawal from the Kyiv axis, the Russian Air Force increased its activity to over 300 sorties per day, focusing on Donbas. Since July 2022, Russian long-range strikes have continued to come predominately from aircraft, namely from Tu-95 and Tu-160 strategic bombers operating around the Caspian Sea and Rostov regions, though the proportion of ground-launched weapons has increased, owing to Russia’s significant use of the S-300 for land attack and likely an increased use of the Iskander system (Figures 10 and 11).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/vjJ93wM.png&quot; alt=&quot;image22&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Russian Kh-101 reportedly shot down by Ukrainian air defenses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LONG-RANGE ALCMS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most frequently used long-range cruise missiles in the war have been the Kh-101 and Kh-555 ALCMs. The Kh-101 is a relatively new missile introduced in 2012 that employs satellite navigation. The older Kh-555 is a conventional variant of the nuclear-armed Kh-55 ALCM. The Russian Air Force has launched both Kh-101s and Kh-555s into Ukraine from Tu-95 and Tu-160 heavy bombers outside of Ukrainian airspace, often as far away as the Caspian Sea (Figure 12). In the past, Russia has referred to the Kh-101 as having stealthy attributes. Ukraine has reported shooting down an increasingly large portion of Kh-101 salvos, putting the purported low observability of the missile into question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/tlEjjHc.png&quot; alt=&quot;image23&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has assessed that Russia has fired over 600 Kh-101 and Kh-555 missiles combined since the war began. This total may include a number of disarmed Kh-55 missiles, whereby the nuclear warhead was removed and replaced with ballast. Such a practice could serve to stretch a dwindling supply of precision-guided missiles and divert fire from air defense systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AIR-TO-SURFACE MISSILES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has also launched a significant number of air-to-surface guided missiles. These weapons are distinct from cruise missiles in that they are typically smaller, shorter ranged (≤300 km), and often employ a rocket engine instead of a jet engine as their primary propulsion (though there are exceptions). They are also generally launched from tactical aircraft such as the Su-24 or Su-25 rather than strategic bombers. Examples of missiles within this category include variants of the Kh-59, Kh-58, Kh-31, and Kh-29.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian government’s numbers on Russian missile attacks through July 21 may also include some uses of closer-range air-to-surface rockets fired from Russian close air support aircraft such as the Su-24 and Su-25, typically with ranges below 10 km. The heaviest of these include the Kh-25 (AS-10), a family of missiles with numerous variants that feature a variety of guidance systems, including satellite navigation, TV-homing, and infrared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has also employed some close-range guided missiles such as the helicopter-launched LMUR, a relatively new anti-armor munition equipped with an electro-optical seeker. Despite its intended anti-tank function, many of the missile’s purported uses in Ukraine have been against fixed targets such as warehouses, pontoon bridges, and other fixed structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/spBXMIk.png&quot; alt=&quot;image24&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Russian Kh-22 missile next to a Tu-22 bomber.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anti-radiation Missiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within this group are two types of anti-radiation missiles (ARMs), the Kh-58 and Kh-31P. ARMs have special seekers that home in on radar emissions, making them useful for suppressing or destroying air defenses. Russia has used them throughout the war, including on the opening day of the war, where debris from a Kh-31P ARM crashed into a residential area of Kyiv. Ukraine reported tracking 35 ARM launches through July 2022. Senior sources in the UAF have reported losing “a number” of mobile 9K33 Osa and 9K37 Buk units to Russian KH-58 and Kh-31P missiles during the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anti-ship Missiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By early summer of 2022, Russia had begun repurposing its stockpile of Kh-22 and Kh-32 air-launched anti-ship missiles for land-attack missions. Developed in the 1960s, the Kh-22 was the Soviet Union’s original “carrier-killer” missile, intended to sink large NATO capital ships. Fired from a Tu-22 bomber, the missile is large, delivering an explosive payload of over 900 kg to a range of around 600 km at supersonic speeds. The Kh-22 uses an active radar seeker for terminal guidance, a system with questionable accuracy when used in cluttered urban environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kh-32 is a modernized version of the Kh-22. Introduced in 2016, the Kh-32 is nearly physically identical to the Kh-22 but has reduced payload size and an active radar seeker that is reportedly more resistant to jamming. Due to its physical similarity with the Kh-22, it was initially unclear whether Russia was also expending Kh-32 missiles against land targets in Ukraine, though Russian state media appeared to confirm its use in November 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine estimates that Russia fired just over 200 Kh-22/32 missiles in 2022. Russia has used the missiles in several high-casualty attacks against civilians. These include a strike on a shopping mall in Kremenchuk in June 2022 which killed at least 20 people, attacks on residential buildings in Odesa that killed more than 20, and a direct strike on an apartment building in Dnipro in January 2023 that killed nearly 50 people. Ukraine has admitted it is unable to intercept the missile with its current air defense systems. This is likely due to the missile’s speed and high flight altitude as well as a flight profile that is more like an aero-ballistic missile than a traditional, sea-skimming anti-ship missile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/AFCmNAh.png&quot; alt=&quot;image25&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Wreckage from 3M-14 Kalibr cruise missile, June 2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aero-Ballistic Missiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has also seen the first use of the Kh-47 Kinzhal aero-ballistic missile, which Russia describes as a hypersonic missile. Kinzhal is a modified 9K720 Iskander ballistic missile launched from a MiG-31K fighter. Russia has reportedly fired Kinzhal missiles on three occasions, and Ukraine estimates that Russia used 10 Kh-47s in 2022. The first use occurred in late March 2022, when Russia reportedly targeted a storage facility in Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast. Subsequent Kinzhal strikes may have occurred in April and May in Donbas and Odesa, respectively. Russia’s sporadic use of the Kinzhal against fixed targets has had little impact on the course of the war. Nevertheless, it has garnered significant attention from the media, prompting comments from senior officials, including Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and President Biden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sea-launched&quot;&gt;Sea-Launched&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian surface ships and submarines have frequently launched 3M-14 Kalibr cruise missiles at Ukraine from the Black and Caspian Seas. These missiles range up to 2,500 km, and Russia has used them against military and infrastructure targets deep in Ukrainian territory, such as airfields. There has nevertheless been significant use of 3M-14s against civilian targets, such as the July attack on a Vinnytsia shopping center and on residential areas in Odesa—strikes of no discernable military value and thus questionable expenditures of some of Russia’s most capable and expensive precision-guided missiles. Since October 2020, 3M-14 Kalibr missiles have had a large role in Russia’s strike campaign against Ukraine’s electrical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian government has assessed that Russia launched just under 600 Kalibr missiles in 2022. The 3M-14 appears to have performed relatively reliably, though there have been some documented mechanical failures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ground-launched&quot;&gt;Ground-Launched&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Short-Range Ballistic Missiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ballistic missile Russia has used most frequently in the war has been the 9M723 short-ranged ballistic missile (SRBM), commonly called the Iskander. It has a range of around 500 km and can deliver a large payload of up to 700 kg. The data on the quantity of 9M723s employed during the war is murky. Early Ukrainian data through July accounted for 124 Iskander launches. A later data set released by Ukraine’s defense minister in January 2023 assessed that Russia had launched nearly 750, suggesting that Russia significantly expanded its use of SRBMs between July and January. Russia may have increased its use of ballistic missiles during its late summer offensives in Donbas to attack military targets closer to the front lines. As an army asset, the Iskander complex is likely to be more integrated with ground operations than the long-range strike platforms operated by Russia’s air force or navy. Overall, the 9M723 has shown to be an accurate and reliable missile and has been an exception in that the Russian army has successfully used it in over-the-horizon strikes on mobile targets, albeit over a limited geographic area in which it can field significant quantities of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has also employed the shorter-range Tochka-U. The Tochka-U can carry a unitary warhead, but it is most often observed employing submunitions. Ukraine claims that Russia fired more than 60 Tochka-Us between February and July 2022. The Tochka-U is the only ballistic missile system Russia and Ukraine deploy in common. Russian state media has nevertheless tried to assert that Russia no longer fields Tochka-U missiles in Ukraine and has tried to blame Ukraine for Tochka-U strikes on civilian targets. However, independent researchers have debunked these claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;9M727/9M728 Ground-Launched Cruise Missile (GLCM)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 9M727 and 9M728 are GLCMs fired from the 9K720 Iskander-M launcher. Their range is around 500 km, like its ballistic missile counterpart. It is unclear what distinguishes the two variants, though some speculate the 9M727 may simply be an older version of the 9M728. The early part of the conflict saw little evidence of widespread use, but imagery of the missiles has surfaced since, confirming it has played a role in Russian strike operations. Ukrainian data from January 2023 estimated that Russia had only fired 68 9M727/9M728 missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;P-800 Oniks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the more notable Russian practices during the war has been its repurposing of anti-ship and air defense missiles for land-attack missions. The earliest instances of this activity began in late March 2022, with strikes in the Odesa region using P-800 Oniks anti-ship missiles reconfigured for land attack. The P-800 is a supersonic missile with an active radar seeker designed to attack heavily defended warships. Their use against static targets raised suspicions that Russia was running low on other precision-guided munitions more fit for purpose. The war in Ukraine is not the first time that Russia had employed the P-800 in a land-attack role, however, as Russia first used the weapon against ground targets in Syria in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since April, Russia has regularly used P-800s against Ukraine, with Ukraine reportedly intercepting two Oniks missiles in late December. Ukraine estimates that Russia launched just under 150 Oniks missiles in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;S-300&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The S-300 is a long-range air defense system. As Russia’s stores of long-range missiles have dwindled, it has begun using S-300 interceptors in surface-to-surface mode for land attack. These munitions have relatively small warheads (most around 150 kg) and use semi-active radar for terminal homing, making them ill-suited for precision attacks or for use against hardened structures. As such, Russia has used them mostly for what appear to be indiscriminate attacks against civilian areas. The city of Mykolaiv in particular reported frequent S-300 barrages through the summer and fall of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike its long-range cruise missile stockpiles, Russia’s supply of air defense interceptors is deep—Russia’s military complex possesses well over 500 S-300 launchers, and Ukraine estimates Russia could have a stockpile of 8,000 interceptors at its disposal. According to Ukraine’s defense ministry, Russia has fired over 1,000 S-300 interceptors against land targets in Ukraine. The bulk of these missiles used in surface-to-surface attacks have likely been the older 5V5KK, which has an estimated strike range of around 120 km. In January 2023, however, Russia reportedly fired longer-range 48N6 interceptor variants at Kyiv for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;foreign-sourced-munitions&quot;&gt;Foreign-Sourced Munitions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One significant development has been Russia’s increasing reliance on foreign-sourced munitions. Notably, Russia has widely employed Iranian-manufactured “kamikaze” drones—loitering munitions with limited battlefield utility. Since mid-2022, Iran has provided Russia with hundreds of Shahed-136 drones. Cheap and easy to manufacture, the Shahed-136 is a delta-wing pusher prop drone that has provided Russia with a means of sustaining attacks behind the front lines against civilian infrastructure, forcing the expenditure of Ukrainian air defense capacity. Iran claims the munitions can fly up to 2,500 km, on par with the reach of Russia’s longest-range cruise missiles. Independent analysts, however, have suggested its real reach could be far lower, though the drones have been observed flying up to 1,000 km to reach their targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the Shahed-136 has significant performance drawbacks which make it a poor stand-in for Russia’s stand-off weapons. It delivers no greater than 50 kg of high explosives to a target, just around 10 percent of the payload capacity of 3M-14 and Kh-101 cruise missiles. The drone is also much slower than a traditional turbofan-powered cruise missile, with a unique (and loud) acoustic signature, making it relatively easy prey for Ukrainian air defenses. Ukraine’s Air Force Command claims to have shot down nearly 500 Shahed-136 drones since their introduction to the battlespace in September 2022. Nevertheless, Russia’s widespread use of these cheap munitions forces Ukraine to expend valuable air defense capacity, which is likely among Russia’s primary goals in continuing to use them. Table-1 provides a comparison of Russian cruise missiles and the Shahed-136.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;POTENTIAL FUTURE IMPORTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been reports that Russia is seeking to import Iranian ballistic missiles. These reports likely refer to Iran’s Fateh series, which includes the Fateh-313 and Zolfaghar missiles, solid-fueled SRBMs that Iran used to attack U.S. troops in Iraq in January 2020. Introducing Fateh-series missiles into the Ukraine conflict would complicate Ukrainian air defense efforts, as Ukraine possesses little to no ballistic missile defense capability. This will change with the transfer of Patriot batteries, which could potentially provide some defense. Still, the defended area of a single Patriot battery is relatively small, and most of the country will remain vulnerable. Nevertheless, the accuracy of Fateh missiles is questionable, and Russia would likely require a large salvo to reliably strike a small target such as an electrical substation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report reviewed Russia’s use of air and missile weapons in Ukraine from three perspectives: what capabilities Russia has used, how Russia used those capabilities, and why the results have failed to live up to Moscow’s expectations. Ukraine’s proactive dispersal of its air defenses and other vulnerable assets in the days leading up to the invasion are central to explaining why Moscow’s strategic strike campaign has not achieved its objective of achieving air superiority or compelling the Ukrainians to negotiate an end to the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dispersal disrupted the Russian military’s targeting cycle enough that it missed its opportunity to decisively shape the battlespace, a misstep from which Russia has yet to fully recover. Ukraine had enough surviving air defenses to attrite and eventually deter the Russian Air Force from penetrating its airspace, forcing Russia to depend on irregular, dwindling stocks of long-range missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, Russian missile forces have shifted away from efforts to degrade Ukraine’s military capacity toward a campaign to degrade the Ukrainian people’s will to fight. Russian attacks have killed thousands of innocent civilians and severely damaged Ukraine’s economic and civil infrastructure. But while Russia has arguably seen greater operational success in this endeavor, it has deepened its strategic failures by stiffening Ukraine’s resolve rather than undermining it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are numerous lessons the United States and its allies can take from Ukraine’s ongoing fight. The first is that ballistic and cruise missiles are not an intractable threat: they can be successfully countered through low- and high-tech means. Ukraine has demonstrated that cruise missile defense through ground-based air defenses is viable, but also that the use of mobility and deception can be just as effective as sophisticated interceptors in blunting missile attacks. Fixed air defense platforms are highly vulnerable unless they themselves are defended. Passive defenses—such as hardening, dispersion, and consequence management—can greatly mitigate the effects of air and missile attacks. Ukraine has demonstrated that Russian theater missiles are a manageable threat, but one that must be managed nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen whether Russia will persist in its current line of attack on Ukraine’s electrical grid or if it will again shift to a new approach. Much may depend on the flow of events on the front lines, the availability of munitions, and the ability of Russian industry to continue producing missiles. Enormous uncertainties remain, but Ukraine will certainly face new challenges in the year to come, requiring it and its partner nations to stay adaptable and committed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;appendices&quot;&gt;Appendices&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following appendices are selected lists of Russian missile strikes from February 2022 through January 2023. They are divided to roughly correspond with the four distinct “phases” of Russia’s strategic strike campaign as described in Chapter 1 of this report. These lists are far from exhaustive and represent only a small fraction of Russian missile activity in the Ukraine war. They nevertheless provide illustrative examples showing the nature of Russian strike operations as the war has progressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Damage to targets indicated should not be considered exhaustive and is limited to what can be visually confirmed or described by credible sources.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;鍾錦麟開始作供 指2020年2月已有共識民主動力協助戴耀廷辦初選&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/sE1WCx7.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（4日）踏入審訊第52天。第三名控方證人、時任民主動力副召集人鍾錦麟今開始作供，供稱時任召集人趙家賢曾望民主動力在2020年立法會換屆選舉「有角色」，但「冇乜人睬佢」；而鍾和趙同年2月與戴耀廷會面，戴表示就選舉協調已聯絡相當數量的民主派及一些資訊科技人士，但欠一個註冊團體和銀行戶口執行計劃，望民主動力可協助，鍾稱會面後遂有共識，民動會協助戴所領導的初選或協調。趙家賢早前強調民主動力於5月初獲邀請，5月中下旬才正式答應承辦初選，法官問民動是否於5月獲正式委任辦初選，鍾指對該說法「唔係太清楚」，「所以冇其他嘢可以協助到法庭。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，時任西貢區議會主席的鍾錦麟亦獲戴耀廷聯絡主持新界東協調會議，他指首次會議討論採取「初選」或「棄選」方案，及目標出選議席數量，但無印象有人提及戴耀廷的文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾錦麟開始作供-稱12歲時任范國威義工19歲曾加入民主黨&quot;&gt;鍾錦麟開始作供 稱12歲時任范國威義工、19歲曾加入民主黨&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;前民主動力召集人趙家賢上周二作供完畢，惟因控方不久前破解鍾錦麟手機，辯方需時審視新收到的逾2,000則訊息，押至今天才傳召鍾錦麟。身穿黑色西裝外套、格仔襯衫、牛仔褲、架黑框眼鏡和戴口罩的鍾錦麟，今午在兩名懲教人員護送下步入法庭，他一度微笑向被告席點頭，宣誓後除下口罩作供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方由署理助理刑事檢控專員（特別職務）羅天瑋負責提問。就鍾的個人背景，鍾確認其英文名字是「Ben」，指「雖然依個唔喺我身分證上面，但係大家都係咁樣稱呼我」，而鍾1988年於香港出生，2020年時33歲，已婚，獲文化研究學士及社會工作碩士學位。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾同意，他自小對政治有興趣，12歲時已成為時任民主黨范國威的義工，而他19歲加入民主黨，加入不久後便退出，並在約2010年加入新民主同盟，范國威曾任該組織輪任召集人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾稱約於2013年認識戴耀廷朋友介紹認識區諾軒曾向趙家賢請教地區工作技巧&quot;&gt;鍾稱約於2013年認識戴耀廷、朋友介紹認識區諾軒、曾向趙家賢請教地區工作技巧&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾同意，於2011年當選西貢區議員，2019年成功連任，並獲選為西貢區議會主席，至2020年已有10年區議員經驗。鍾曾聽聞和知悉戴耀廷推動的「雷動計劃」和「風雲計劃」，被問是否認識戴耀廷，鍾指約於中學時開始看法律相關書籍，許多關於憲制的概念都是由戴撰寫。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡打斷問控方是否想問鍾個人是否認識戴，羅天瑋遂改問鍾任區議員時是否認識戴。鍾確認，指戴約於2012、2013年提出「佔領中環」行動前，曾發起很多「商討日」，他在商討日經人介紹後與戴「互相打咗聲招呼」，但沒有特別再商討任何事情。鍾續指，佔領運動後沒再與戴特別聯絡，但在2015、2016年左右戴在其他場合有與他不定期聯絡，二人並於戴2016年開始提倡「風雲計劃」時討論區議會選舉事宜。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於同被指為組織者的區諾軒和趙家賢，鍾表示於2009、2010年區諾軒申請加入民主黨時，經朋友介紹認識區，之後有與區接觸。而他約於2007、2008年認識趙家賢，因鍾當時已立志參與2011年區選，而趙是當年區選最年輕的當選人，故向趙請教地區工作的技巧，趙並建議他修讀調解課程，指對地區工作「好有幫助」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾表示，於2014、2015年左右加入民主動力，其後成為民動副召集人。羅天瑋其後展示鍾的 Facebook 專頁，他確認是他作為議員向公眾發布訊息的專頁。羅一度問公眾如何能載入其專頁，余慧明面露驚訝，鄒家成亦發笑，鍾指若有人搜尋他的名字就相當可能找到該專頁，其宣傳品等亦有相關網址。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾稱民主動力曾嘗試協調2020年立會選舉-但實際由戴耀廷主導&quot;&gt;鍾稱民主動力曾嘗試協調2020年立會選舉 但實際由戴耀廷主導&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據民主動力 Facebook，民動使命包括協調參與立法會選舉及區議會選舉。被問民主動力有否參與協調2020年立法會選舉，鍾指在2020年1、2月時「曾經嘗試去做協調，但係實際最後係由戴耀廷主導咗成個協調嘅程序」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指即與「35+計劃」無關，鍾同意，並問法庭是否容許他用「少少時間」講述民主動力當時望協調立會選舉的背景。李運騰問是否需要，控方指只需很簡單的背景。鍾其後在法官追問下，指「民主動力曾經嘗試協調『35+計劃』以外嘅協調」，並同意民主動力在戴耀廷的「35+計劃」以外，原本另有協調計劃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾稱2020年2月和趙家賢與戴耀廷會面談協調-戴稱已聯絡不同民主派望眾籌初選費用&quot;&gt;鍾稱2020年2月和趙家賢與戴耀廷會面談協調 戴稱已聯絡不同民主派、望眾籌初選費用&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續問及民主動力與戴耀廷的討論，鍾錦麟指，「趙家賢曾經希望民主動力可以協調到，或者當年嘅換屆選舉有角色，但係冇乜人睬佢」，陳志全發笑。鍾並指，民動另一位副召集人馮志活知道此情況後，亦知道區諾軒與戴耀廷正進行「非常之類近嘅工作」，即游說不同民主派人士進行選舉協調，便安排鍾錦麟、趙家賢和戴耀廷會面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾表示，3人於2020年2月左右在太古城東隅酒店一所餐廳會面，會上戴耀廷提及因民主派在2019年區議會選舉大勝，認為「數字上面民主派係能夠攞到立法會過半席位」，故望進行協調工作，並表示已聯絡到相當數量的不同光譜民主派人士進行協調或初選，但沒有詳細描述或提及是什麼人或政黨。戴亦指已聯絡了一些「IT人」（資訊科技人士）設計初選流程，甚至望該初選程式可乘機做認證，不同選區的選民可獲發一個數碼代幣（token），除了在是次初選使用，亦可在日後社區議題上做決策。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾亦指，戴建議以眾籌籌得初選所需經費，但他與趙家賢有相當保留，認為應由參與初選或協調的人攤分所有相關開支，以控制成本，避免不同光譜的參選人士提出越來越多要求。惟戴擔心素人會認為此做法即要他們負擔很高昂的費用、覺得這是由大黨壟斷的制度，故認為眾籌較可取，亦對此「非常之有信心」。鍾指民動沒有反對戴的說法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾稱2020年2月民主動力已有共識-協助戴耀廷領導的協調&quot;&gt;鍾稱2020年2月民主動力已有共識 協助戴耀廷領導的協調&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問戴有否提及協調時的困難，鍾指戴會上提到「好多嘅無論聯絡候選人、或者實際執行方法上面都已經係準備好㗎啦，但係佢冇一個註冊嘅團體同埋相關嘅銀行戶口去執行相關嘅計劃，所以希望民主動力可以協助」，並指「呢個見面就有共識，民主動力會協助戴耀廷所領導嘅初選或者協調」，林卓廷點頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢早前強調民主動力於2月獲邀列席協調會議，5月初獲戴耀廷及區諾軒邀請承辦初選，至5月中下旬才正式答應。法官陳慶偉問，所以在2020年2月已有此共識？鍾答「正確」。陳再問那在2020年5月，民主動力是否獲正式委任？鍾表示：「對於法官呢個講法我唔係太清楚，所以冇其他嘢可以協助到法庭」，林卓廷發笑。陳再指，正式委任即是有白紙黑字，鍾回應「我對一啲明文嘅協議並唔知情」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;羅天瑋續問，戴耀廷有否提及希望民主動力如何幫忙。陳慶偉指不認為需問到這麼仔細，指這並非本案重點。羅改問誰代表民主動力與戴耀廷聯絡，鍾指是趙家賢，而時任民主動力總幹事黎敬輝有協助趙。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾稱獲戴耀廷聯絡主持新東會議-何桂藍鄒家成等出席&quot;&gt;鍾稱獲戴耀廷聯絡主持新東會議 何桂藍、鄒家成等出席&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾錦麟續指，戴認為不同地區選舉的協調，「應該係由唔同選區嘅區議會主席去協助」，故戴3月左右聯絡他，望幫手主持新界東協調會議，戴亦有聯絡時任沙田區議會主席程張迎。鍾一度指，「我喺度需唔需要停一停，定我驚時序上一路講到7月會好亂」，羅天瑋指會繼續問此議題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;新界東首次會議於4月14日在旺角教協辦事處舉行，鍾指會議由戴耀廷、區諾軒、他本人及程張迎主持，並有數十人參與，均由戴邀請，包括何桂藍、鄒家成、劉頴匡，以及民主黨、公民黨、人民力量、社民連和區政聯盟的代表。鍾指，一些沒參與選舉協調的組織都有參與，指基本上戴耀廷在 Facebook 觀察到在政治上和在該區「比較活躍」的團體，「都會邀請佢嚟一齊商討。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問會議一開始有沒有人進行介紹，鍾指沒有印象，因他當天遲到，而他到場後戴耀廷正邀請各參與者介紹自己。被問是否認識何桂藍，鍾稱「我喺2019年嘅社會事件上面知佢係『立場姐姐』囉」，至於鄒家成，鍾則知道他參選2019年區議會選舉，但因與民主黨撞區，最後落敗。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾指會上討論協調方案-與會者關注約束力問題惟無深入討論如何處理&quot;&gt;鍾指會上討論協調方案 與會者關注約束力問題惟無深入討論如何處理&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾指與會者自我介紹後，大家就商討新界東究竟採取「初選」抑或「協調」的方案，並指印象中是由戴耀廷介紹。陳慶偉一度問，一份名為「35+計劃」的文件有否向與會者介紹或傳閱？庭上早前展示該文件，提及「五大訴求，缺一不可」及各區議席目標等。鍾稱「冇印象」，指戴耀廷很多時透過 WhatsApp 主動發出該些文件，但他沒印象收到，在會議前亦沒印象戴有發出任何關於會議的資料。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就上述兩個方案，鍾指有部分人選擇「初選」、部分人選擇「協調」。被問與會者有否解釋選擇的原因，鍾指是「關於約束力嘅問題」，指協調方案是商討好目標議席數目後，全部人都可以參選，但「部分嘅參選人會擔心有人唔承認成個協議，繼續去參選或者繼續進行佢嘅選舉工程」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;羅天瑋問，就約束力的問題，戴耀廷有否要求參與者作出任何協議，鍾稱「會上面冇討論到如何有一個大家有說服力嘅方法去令大家都 binding（被約束）」，並在法官追問下指即「冇傾過」相關方法，指「大家表達完關注（約束力的問題）之後，冇就住呢個問題深入去討論點執行成件事」。至於會上有沒有記錄，鍾稱「我冇獲知會呢個會議係有記錄」，亦沒有獲展示黎敬輝所做的筆記。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾指趙家賢會上無發言會上無印象有人提戴耀廷文章&quot;&gt;鍾指趙家賢會上無發言、會上無印象有人提戴耀廷文章&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾錦麟確認，民主動力的趙家賢和黎敬輝都有出席該會議，「但係佢哋係嚟旁聽」，二人亦沒有提出意見，趙家賢會上亦沒有說過任何話。不過趙家賢早前供稱會上有本土派質疑民主動力是「大台」時，他有作回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於鍾本人，則就採用「初選」或「棄選」方案，及目標出選議席數量「帶領大家討論」。法官陳慶偉指，鍾錦麟當時有兩個身分（wore two hats），即西貢區議會主席及民主動力副召集人，但他在新東首次會議只有一個身分？鍾指「正確」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;羅天瑋其後展示戴耀廷於3月31日發布的〈立會過半是大殺傷力憲制武器〉、3月10日的〈齊上齊落　目標 35+〉，及4月14日的〈攬炒的定義和時間〉，提及要取得立會過半，及預計立法會會期只有7個多月等。羅問，新東首次會議上有沒有人提及過上述3篇文章的概念？鍾指「冇印象有」，亦沒有印象有人對戴的文章發表任何意見。此前趙家賢曾稱新東首次會議上，有本土派稱支持戴〈攬炒的定義和時間〉一文，戴並以「溫和好多」字眼解釋，而鄒家成和莊榮輝等亦就否決預算案字眼「企晒起身」討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;羅天瑋指會問及下一個議題，案件明天續審。臨散庭前，法官陳仲衡着鍾不可以與其他人提及本案，又指相信已安排處理鍾的證供。此前趙家賢作供第3天仍管有其證人供詞。羅天瑋回覆相信懲教有安排，鍾並主動舉手補充：「我嘅證供已經係被懲教署入起咗，封存咗。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two dates from 2022 seem certain to echo in geopolitical history. The first, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, hardly needs further explanation. The second is October 7, when the United States government enacted a series of new export control regulations targeting China’s artificial intelligence (AI) and semiconductor industries. While most Americans are likely only faintly aware of the October 7 policy and its significance, the date marked the beginning of a new era in U.S.-China relations and with it international politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Secretary of State Tony Blinken nearly said as much in a speech delivered only ten days after the new policy was enacted. “We are at an inflection point,” Blinken said. “The post-Cold War world has come to an end, and there is an intense competition underway to shape what comes next. And at the heart of that competition is technology.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many ways, the October 7 policy was narrowly targeted. It only restricted exports of certain types of advanced computer chips for AI applications and the diverse set of technologies needed to design and manufacture AI chips. However, the implementation approach and underlying logic of the new regulations marked a major reversal of 25 years of U.S. trade and technology policy toward China in at least three ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, rather than restricting exports of advanced semiconductor technology to China based on whether the exports were related to military end-uses or to prohibited end-users, the new policy restricted them on a geographic basis for China as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, previous U.S. export controls were designed to allow China to progress technologically, but to restrict the pace so that the United States and its allies retained a durable lead. The new policy, by contrast, actively degraded the peak technological capability of China’s semiconductor industry. Leading Chinese semiconductor firms such as Biren, YMTC, SMIC, and SMEE have all been set back years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, to the extent possible, the policy seeks to prevent China from ever again reaching certain advanced performance thresholds in semiconductor technology. Rather than revising the performance thresholds upward every few years as had been done in the past, the Biden administration intends to hold those benchmarks constant, meaning that the gap in performance will grow over time as the world advances and China remains stuck behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The October 7 policy and the ongoing U.S. campaign to persuade key U.S. allies to join it represents a transformed landscape for the Chinese semiconductor industry, which had previously been making rapid, albeit uneven, technological progress. This report provides clues to understanding China’s updated semiconductor strategy in this new era of global technology competition. In doing so, it draws upon dozens of CSIS interviews with global semiconductor industry executives, U.S. and international government officials, as well as an analysis of noteworthy Chinese government publications, leadership statements, and commentary from Chinese experts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Section 1: The turning point in China’s strategic thinking on semiconductors&lt;/strong&gt; analyzes key Chinese government publications and policies between 2018 and 2022, providing the necessary historical context to understand China’s reaction to the October 7 export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Section 2: China’s post-October 7 industrial policy challenge&lt;/strong&gt; characterizes China’s current position in the semiconductor value chain to explain why the October 7 U.S. export controls — as well as the related controls announced in March 2023 by the Netherlands and Japan — pose such a significant challenge for China’s industrial policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Section 3: China’s strategic objectives in responding to October 7&lt;/strong&gt; provides analysis of China’s strategic objectives for the semiconductor industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Section 4: China strikes back — new and old tactics for the updated strategy&lt;/strong&gt; analyzes how China’s government and industry are responding to October 7 and shows how they form the basis of an updated Chinese semiconductor strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;section-1-the-turning-point-in-chinas-strategic-thinking-on-semiconductors&quot;&gt;Section 1: The Turning Point in China’s Strategic Thinking on Semiconductors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the initial months after the October 7 U.S. export controls, China’s response appeared relatively muted. China publicly criticized U.S. actions in a variety of diplomatic fora, filed a suit against the United States in the World Trade Organization, and reportedly considered (but did not publicly announce) proposals for massive additional semiconductor industry subsidies of more than 1 trillion yuan ($143 billion). A January news report from Bloomberg, citing anonymous Chinese sources, stated that the subsidy plan is on pause. Overall, the aggregate Chinese response in the first few months after October 7 appeared far from equivalent to what the United States had done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, developing major policy responses takes time, and in the past two months, there are indications of both retaliation against the United States — such as initiating a cybersecurity review of U.S. memory chip producer Micron — and a shift in China’s overall semiconductor strategy. These will be addressed in greater depth in Section 4 of this report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, part of the reason that China’s response to the October 7 export controls seems muted is because China’s “response” had already been underway for years. For China’s leadership, the decisive moment in shaping semiconductor strategy was not October 2022, but April 2018, when the United States imposed extremely strict export controls against a major Chinese telecommunications company, ZTE. While the October 7 export controls were in many ways a far more decisive action on the U.S. side, the harrowing experience with ZTE had already led China’s leadership to view the semiconductor industry primarily in national security terms, not economic terms. They came to believe that more extreme U.S. moves in the future were inevitable, including some of what was ultimately included in the October 7 policy (though China was clearly surprised by the timing, breadth, and sophistication of the controls). Thus, much of the shift in China’s semiconductor strategy to blunt future U.S. semiconductor export controls was already underway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding the intensity of China’s efforts to eliminate U.S. and allied technology from its semiconductor supply chain, one senior U.S. government official told CSIS, “Even before October 7, on a scale of one to ten, China was already an eleven.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, understanding how China adjusted its strategy in response to the April 2018 semiconductor export controls against ZTE provides the vital context through which to view China’s response to the October 7 export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of the ZTE sanctions is complicated. To briefly summarize: ZTE had illegally evaded U.S. sanctions by selling telecom equipment containing U.S. chip technology to Iran. ZTE got caught by U.S. authorities in March 2016, and, after a year of legal wrangling, pled guilty, settled with the U.S. government, and paid a $1.2 billion fine in March 2017. However, in early 2018, the U.S. government caught ZTE failing to abide by the terms of the settlement and making false statements to the U.S. government, which ZTE again admitted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In export controls, the most extreme punishments are usually reserved for companies that repeatedly engage in unlawful activity, especially after pleading guilty. In April 2018, the United States dropped the hammer: the U.S. government imposed sanctions and export controls upon ZTE — China’s second-largest telecommunications equipment company at the time. Among other restrictions, the controls prevented ZTE from buying U.S.-designed semiconductors for use in its telecommunications products. Since many U.S. semiconductor products are specified in international telecommunications technical standards, there was no viable alternative to U.S. technology. ZTE’s manufacturing and sales ground to a halt because they could not build their products without U.S. chips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a matter of months, ZTE’s financial situation transformed from significant profitability and rapid growth to imminent bankruptcy. ZTE was ultimately given a lifeline by the intervention of then-U.S. President Donald Trump at the personal request of Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did China’s leadership react to the ZTE crisis? Reaching a firm conclusion about the decision-making process of China’s most senior leadership is notoriously difficult because they learned to be vague and secretive. After the 2015 publication of China’s Made in China 2025 policy sparked an international backlash, the industrial policy language in public Chinese government documents and leadership speeches, including on semiconductors, became significantly more secretive. Even though Made in China 2025 is no longer openly discussed in Chinese government leadership speeches, there is ample evidence that it remains a keystone industrial policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the secrecy and evasiveness, there are three pieces of strong and publicly available evidence that U.S. export controls on ZTE directly led to a major shift in Chinese strategic thinking. First, the Chinese government immediately began commissioning research on its strategic technology vulnerabilities. Second, speeches by Chinese leadership indicate that ZTE was viewed as a turning point. Third, China made significant changes to its semiconductor policy in the years following ZTE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-government-research-into-technology-chokepoints&quot;&gt;China’s Government Research into Technology Chokepoints&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July of 2018, Science and Technology Daily, an official newspaper of China’s Ministry of Science and Technology, published a series of articles detailing China’s most vulnerable technology “chokepoints.” (Note: the same Chinese phrase “卡脖子” is sometimes alternatively translated as “strangleholds”). Chokepoint technologies are those for which China is critically dependent upon U.S., Japanese, and European suppliers and for which producing Chinese substitutes is extremely difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben Murphy of the Center for Security and Emerging Technology published an astute analysis of the series. In it, Murphy points out that the articles are a rare example of public Chinese government publications that provide specifics on a vague but extremely important phrase, “key and core technologies are controlled by others.” The “others” are the United States and its allies. The “key and core technologies” are the 35 identified chokepoints, seven of which directly relate to the semiconductor industry, spanning nearly every segment of the semiconductor value chain. The phrase began to frequently appear in Chinese leadership speeches and state-run media after April 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;speeches-by-chinese-leaders-after-the-april-2018-zte-crisis&quot;&gt;Speeches by Chinese Leaders after the April 2018 ZTE Crisis&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second key set of evidence on the importance of April 2018 are Chinese leadership speeches. In November 2018, Dr. Tan Tieniu, then the Deputy Secretary-General of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, gave a speech before many of China’s most senior leadership at the 13th National People’s Congress Standing Committee. In the speech, he argued that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The U.S. ban on ZTE fully demonstrates the importance of independent, controllable core-, high-, and foundational technologies. In order to avoid repeating this disaster, China should learn its lesson about importing core electronic components, high-end general-purpose chips, and foundational software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of what Tan argues is consistent with decades of Chinese industrial policy, including Made in China 2025. However, Tan’s speech is indicative of how the ZTE experience in 2018 marked a turning point in the thinking of China’s senior leadership. Strengthening China’s position in strategic technologies was already a long-term economic development policy goal, but it was now also an urgent national security priority: reducing China’s vulnerability to U.S. economic pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though Tan’s language is blunter, the need to reduce the Chinese technology ecosystem’s exposure to foreign pressure on national security grounds likewise became a recurring theme of General Secretary Xi’s speeches in the wake of the ZTE crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, in a November 2018 Speech, Xi said that “Internationally, advanced technology and key technology is more and more difficult to obtain. Unilateralism and trade protectionism have risen, forcing us to travel the road of self-reliance.” Keeping with China’s goal of industrial policy secrecy, the speech was censored. For their international editions, Chinese government news outlets removed all of Xi’s use of the phrase “self-reliance.” The phrase has an important and controversial connection to Mao Zedong-era China. It also echoes the Made in China 2025 strategy of reducing China’s dependence on foreign technology. The Roadmap of Major Technical Domains for Made in China 2025, which was published in September 2015 and covered semiconductors and other sectors, included goals such as “replacement of imports with Chinese-made products basically achieved in key industries” by 2025. The self-reliance phrase also recalls Chinese efforts to improve technology through intellectual property theft and coercing foreign firms to transfer technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September 2020, the U.S.-China Trade war had caused Xi and other Chinese officials to return to more hawkish (and candid) language. Xi gave a speech in which he compared the urgency of China’s modern need for improved domestic technology independence to the significance of China’s 20th century nuclear weapons development program, a success that is deeply revered in Communist Party ideology. Xi further stated that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As for industry, some critical, core technologies are under the control of others. We rely on imports for some critical devices . . . We need to rush forward with technologies that can make rapid breakthroughs and promptly solve problems. As for strategic technologies that require a long time to succeed, these need to be deployed ahead of schedule . . . China is faced with many “chokepoint” technological problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the overall Chinese strategy goes further than merely freeing itself from technological dependence on the United States: China also wants to ensure that the United States is dependent upon China. On April 10, 2020, Xi gave a speech at the seventh meeting of the Central Financial and Economic Affairs Commission in which he said, “we must tighten international production chains’ dependence on China, forming powerful countermeasures and deterrent capabilities based on artificially cutting off supply to foreigners.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;changes-in-chinas-semiconductor-policy&quot;&gt;Changes in China’s Semiconductor Policy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third piece of evidence that ZTE marked a turning point in Chinese thinking comes from the actual behavior of Chinese companies and especially the policies of the Chinese government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the private sector, Chinese technology companies began — with extraordinary government financial support — amassing stockpiles of chips and chip-making equipment, buying far in excess of current demand as a hedge against potential future restrictions. Semiconductor executives told CSIS that they had routinely referred to Chinese customers under the label of “non-market demand,” meaning that the customers were buying for strategic reasons unrelated to market conditions or profit-maximization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the public sector, the Chinese government continued with earlier efforts to massively subsidize growth of the Chinese semiconductor sector but changed its emphasis. The $21 billion National Integrated Circuit Industry Fund (commonly referred to as China’s “Big Fund”) that China’s central government launched in 2014 was renewed in 2019 with an additional $35 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with all Chinese industrial policy, China’s local governments play a critical role in implementing central government semiconductor policy, including bearing much of the financial burden. In addition to the national-level Big Fund, China’s local governments established 15 semiconductor investment funds worth an additional $25 billion. China also stepped up its basket of other industry support tools, including government grants, tax breaks, equity investments, and low interest loans. The U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association estimated in 2021 that these direct and indirect subsidies were worth more than $50 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the ZTE experience, China’s massive state support increased. More importantly, though, the subsidies shifted to prioritize the growth of domestic semiconductor capacity and alternatives to foreign, especially U.S., technology dependencies. Rather than pursuing the most profitable market opportunities, the Chinese government directed state support toward eliminating chokepoint dependencies in China’s semiconductor value chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of this strategic shift was put in motion shortly after the ZTE experience, but it was formally written down in the Chinese State Council’s July 2020 Document No. 8 “Issuance of the New Era to Promote the Integrated Circuit Industry.” In an analysis of Document No. 8, Tai Ming Cheung, Barry Naughton, and Eric Hagt, wrote that China’s central government “essentially advocated unlimited support for semiconductor projects,” and directs all Chinese local governments to “do everything in their power” to promote the semiconductor sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Document No. 8 provides financial and other support measures like exempting most Chinese semiconductor companies from most import duties and corporate profit taxes, with some sectors exempted from taxes for as long as ten years. The document acknowledges China’s need for foreign semiconductor technology imports, but it firmly grounds this in a self-reliance mindset. It states that, “For a certain period of time, key integrated circuit and software companies receiving state support must temporarily import equipment for their own use.” China views semiconductor equipment imports as a temporary waypoint on the path to technological self-sufficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after the publication of Document No. 8, China published its 14th 5-year economic plan, covering the years 2021-2025. In an August 2020 speech discussing the 5-year economic plan, Xi stated that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The international economy, technology, culture, security and politics are undergoing fundamental shifts in many ways. The world is entering into a time of turbulence and transformation. For a while, we will face an external environment with more adverse forces. Therefore, we must be prepared for a series of new risks and challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We must fully bring into play the obvious advantage of China’s socialist system, namely its ability to focus effort on undertaking daunting tasks and do a good job in the fierce battle for key and core technologies. China has a gigantic market and full-fledged industrial system, which is a unique advantage to foster massive application and rapid iteration of new technologies. With such strength, we are able to accelerate the conversion of S&amp;amp;T achievements into real productive forces, and to improve and protect the security of our production chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, Xi’s thinking is reflected in the final, public version of the 5-year plan adopted in October 2020, which declares the semiconductor industry to be a top technology priority. The official summary of the Communist Party’s Central Committee meeting adopting the 5-year plan was blunt: it stated that China would “make technological self-sufficiency a strategic pillar of national development.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the ZTE event did not occur in a vacuum, and it was not the sole factor in the Chinese government’s new semiconductor strategy. Other events during the Trump administration also weighed heavily, including U.S. sanctions on Huawei and Fujian Jinhua, the Dutch government blocking exports of Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography machines, and the U.S.-China Trade War. Nevertheless, the three lines of evidence summarized above show that Chinese national security leadership was focused on the problem of dependence on U.S. technology years before October 2022. These leaders, including Xi, knew that even their strongest technology companies could potentially be strangled quickly and decisively by a U.S. government willing to exploit America’s control of technology chokepoints. Thus, when the Biden administration launched the October 7, 2022 export controls policy, many of the key strategic pillars of the Chinese response were already underway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as Moscow’s weaponization of Europe’s dependence on Russian natural gas sparked efforts to remake Europe’s energy sector toward a future without Russia, countries that exploit their strategic position in the semiconductor industry risk persuading geopolitical competitors that they must fiercely work to free themselves of such vulnerabilities or develop countermeasures. Countries with a privileged position in the semiconductor value chain therefore would face a tradeoff between the foreign policy benefits of exploiting their advantage now and the potential risks of weakening, over time, the customer dependence that is the source of that advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, that tradeoff was less of a factor in this case. From the perspective of the Biden administration, the U.S. and its allies were already bearing most of the cost of enacting a policy such as the October 7 export controls even before Biden took office. The key here is that in the mid-2010s China was already aggressively pursuing a semiconductor self-sufficiency strategy under the Made in China 2025 economic development policy. Then, in April 2018, the ZTE crisis and related U.S. actions had shifted China’s main semiconductors focus from one of many economic development “nice to have” goals to an urgent national security priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time the Biden administration took office, China’s leaders were already persuaded that America could never be trusted when it comes to semiconductors, and that China should do whatever it takes to build an all-Chinese supply chain as quickly as possible. In making such an assessment, the Biden administration had the benefit of not only all the publicly available evidence reviewed in this report, but also classified intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If China was already going to pursue semiconductor technology independence at any cost — regardless of the Biden administration’s actions — that necessitated a changed approach from the United States and its allies. Instead of attempting to persuade China away from its “self-reliance” strategy, the United States now needed to ensure that the strategy failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;section-2-chinas-post-october-7-industrial-policy-challenge&quot;&gt;Section 2: China’s Post-October 7 Industrial Policy Challenge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The global semiconductor value chain is remarkably complex. Some companies play a diverse set of roles, and others are highly specialized. But no single company — indeed no single country — is currently capable of internally performing all roles in the value chain for all the types of semiconductors required for a modern economy. Leading chip sellers routinely have tens of thousands of suppliers distributed globally, and some suppliers are the only companies in the world that possess their technological capabilities at the required performance and reliability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. October 7 export controls, alongside the related export controls adopted by Japan and the Netherlands in March 2023, have been analyzed at length in other CSIS reports. Readers are advised to consult these analyses for a more in-depth treatment of the challenge that these policies pose to China’s AI and semiconductor industries, as well as the legitimate national security reasons that the United States and its allies have for pursuing the policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section will focus instead on the significant challenge that the (now multilateral) October 7 export controls pose to China’s industrial strategy for semiconductors. The three countries — along with Taiwan and Korea which are partly covered by U.S. application of the Foreign Direct Product Rule — are working together in a way that challenges China’s ambitions across nearly every segment of the semiconductor value chain. The export controls target China across design, design software, fabrication, materials, chemicals, and manufacturing equipment. Within equipment, the combination of U.S., Dutch, and Japanese controls covers nearly every type of advanced chip-making equipment: etching, lithography, deposition, metrology, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/RNnqEQr.png&quot; alt=&quot;image1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, this means that China’s dreams of self-reliance will face multiple extremely challenging technological barriers that China must overcome simultaneously in order to extract any benefit or financial return on investment. Even if China succeeds in creating an advanced AI chip-design firm, Chinese foundries cannot fabricate the chips without advanced foreign equipment and chemicals, which are restricted by the export controls. International chip foundries will refuse to fabricate the Chinese designs, because these are covered by the U.S. application of the foreign direct product rule on U.S. chip design software and U.S. manufacturing equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story is even more difficult for Chinese chip foundries, which cannot import the advanced production equipment they need to make chips better than the performance thresholds covered in the export controls (16nm logic, 18nm DRAM, and 128-layer NAND). Even if a Chinese semiconductor equipment firm succeeds in making a single type of advanced equipment domestically — an astonishingly difficult and expensive task — that piece of equipment is nearly useless by itself. In the same way that no commercial jet airliner can fly without wings, engines, electronics, and landing gear, only a complete set of semiconductor production equipment can produce a finished chip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the degree of precision and reliability required for advanced semiconductor manufacturing means that there is a major gap between building a prototype system and producing such systems at competitive performance and scale. Thus, individual Chinese company successes in a single advanced technology cannot gain commercial market traction. The entire Chinese semiconductor ecosystem has to be domestically self-sufficient before China can produce chips at the October 7 performance thresholds. This is the October 7 challenge that China’s semiconductor industrial policy confronts. Of course, it also faces the traditional challenges of industrial policy: information asymmetry and crony capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information asymmetry refers to the fact that government bureaucrats generally do not know which firms will effectively use government subsidies and protectionist policies (which firms want) to advance the country’s overall technology level (which the government wants).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crony capitalism refers to the fact that many approaches to allocating subsidies (aka “picking winners”) will merely result in political capture through an alliance of rent-seeking firms and corrupt government officials. Politically connected firms often secure government support for reasons unrelated to their technological and managerial competence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The traditional industrial policy mechanism for solving these two challenges is “export discipline,” which conditions state support such that it primarily rewards firms for successfully exporting in foreign markets rather than selling to protected domestic ones. Foreign customers in technologically advanced economies will naturally demand that their exporting suppliers adopt international best practices in management and technology to meet their stringent standards. Foreign customers can also provide expertise and other support to directly aid a supplier’s advancement. This solves both the information asymmetry problem (since bureaucrats can align subsidies to a clear exports metric that provides the needed market signal) and the crony capitalism problem (by automatically allocating subsidies according to export success rather than political connections).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Export discipline played a significant role in the successful industrial policies and technological development of Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea during the 20th century. China’s modern export boom, however, occurred after China joined the World Trade Organization (WTO), which banned export subsidies for its members in 1995. China has at different times provided various government incentives — such as tax rebates, an under-valued currency, and low-interest loans — to encourage exports, but the Japanese, South Korean, and Taiwanese approaches were more targeted and linked to specific performance criteria, fostering a stronger sense of export discipline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, China’s post-WTO industrial policy approach (especially after 2006) to ensuring that subsidies and protectionist support are productively allocated toward desired economic and technological development goals took a different path, one that relies more on foreign firms owning production facilities in China. China was far more reliant upon foreign direct investment than South Korea, Japan, or Taiwan during their major growth periods. The influx of foreign capital, technology, and managerial expertise has been instrumental in the growth of many industries in China, including semiconductors. By contrast, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan relied more on domestic investment (through strict government control of the financial system) and technology transfers through licensing agreements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for China, the Chinese domestic market is now large enough that some of the traditional weak points of industrial policy are less of a factor than they were in those countries. Even in Chinese industries that are almost entirely protected from foreign competition, such as internet tech, the competition in the domestic market is fierce enough to weed out weak players, and the market is large enough to support multiple large-scale firms. Semiconductor producers in South Korea and Taiwan, by contrast, had no choice but to rely on exports in order to generate sufficient revenues to support the relevant economies of scale and the organizational learning scale provides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the necessary background to understand why the October 7 export controls pose such a challenge for the advancement of the Chinese semiconductor industry. For Chinese chipmakers and chip equipment makers, as well as the bureaucrats seeking to support them, exposure to international markets was the key to providing the critical feedback needed to ensure that they pursued the right technological and operational development path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before October 7, China’s chip manufacturing industry could walk that path one step at a time, making progress in advanced etching equipment while lagging in lithography, for example. Now, however, for China to produce chips at the 16 nm logic node or better (or the equivalent technology benchmarks in memory), China will have to break through every single incredibly difficult technological barrier before its firms can begin producing advanced chips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worse, Chinese semiconductor equipment firms will have to do so almost entirely without expertise and advice provided by U.S., Japanese, and Dutch firms. The export controls make transfers of such knowledge also subject to export license requirements, and thus de facto banned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there are essentially no prospects for foreign customers of Chinese chipmaking equipment. Most of the advanced Chinese equipment producers have been added to the U.S. entity list, meaning they are too risky to have as a supplier for products where a long-term relationship is essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prospects are better for foreign customers of Chinese chipmakers (aka “fabs”). Since many international companies assemble their finished goods in China, many “domestic” chip sales actually represent global market and international customer demand. Even here, however, the situation has worsened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In mid-2022, Apple was on track to purchase advanced NAND memory chips from China’s YMTC for use in iPhones. Apple cancelled the order in the wake of the export controls. Qualcomm, which alone accounts for about 20% of Chinese foundry SMIC’s revenue, is reportedly considering whether to drop SMIC as a supplier even for chips less advanced than those covered by the October 7 performance thresholds. Computer maker Dell announced plans to cease purchases of Chinese chips by 2024. As China’s semiconductor industry becomes increasingly government-driven and cracks down on foreign firms, this global exodus will accelerate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For China’s advanced node (though not legacy node) chipmaking industry, export discipline (or the version with Chinese characteristics) is now essentially off the table. That means China will have to achieve economies of scale and the organizational learning that scale brings with almost entirely domestic sales. That is not inconceivable, but it is far riskier and more expensive. China’s domestic semiconductor market is massive. But, as mentioned above, much of that “domestic” demand is international in nature, since semiconductors are an intermediate good for finished products assembled in China for foreign-owned firms and export to global markets. These domestic Chinese chip sales to foreign firms are likely to drop off. Without export discipline, China lacks a clear path to avoid the traps of information asymmetry and crony capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, China’s government has a poor track record of picking winners in the semiconductor industry. In recent years, the strategy has essentially been to flood the sector with money, watch new entrants rush in, and then double down on the winners. In low capex segments of the semiconductor industry, such as chip design, this is a viable strategy, especially when paired with export discipline. But in the high capex segments of the industry, such as chip fabrication and semiconductor equipment manufacturing, the costs of doing anything other than picking a small set of winners in advance are astronomical. Thus, China has had to place a few extremely expensive bets and watch most of the “winners” that the Chinese government picks go bankrupt even with massive government support. 3,470 Chinese chip companies shuttered in the first 8 months of 2022 (i.e., even before October 7), up from 1,397 in the full year 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Widespread corruption does not help. Many of these bankrupt chip companies died under a cloud of corruption, financial fraud, and extraordinary waste. Several of the top leaders of China’s semiconductor “Big Fund” were arrested in 2022 on corruption charges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The high capex requirements of these segments already made executing China’s standard playbook especially difficult. A near total loss of the ability to rely on export discipline — certainly in advanced segments — is going to make China’s crony capitalism and corruption challenges worse. In the non-advanced segments, Chinese chip equipment producers are still subject to foreign competition, whose products are vastly superior on every metric that matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is probably willing to pump vastly more money into the system, but at this scale the marginal value of additional money is relatively low and probably more likely to enrich corrupt officials than it is to produce leading firms. A U.S. government official told CSIS that “Chinese semiconductor subsidies were already past the limit of what the industry could productively absorb.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these extraordinary headwinds, China is not going to give up. Perhaps 20th century Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan had the better industrial policy, but 21st century China is richer and more stubborn. In many other sectors, such as electric cars, China’s leadership has shown extraordinary patience and a willingness to waste astonishing sums of money in order to give birth to globally competitive Chinese firms. Sometimes, however, this patience has borne fruit: a recent Economist article was titled “China’s BYD is overtaking Tesla as the carmaker extraordinaire.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, China’s basic strategy of pursuing self-reliance in semiconductors on national security grounds was already solidified after April 2018 and remains in place. However, October 7 was a watershed moment in international relations, one that occurred sooner than China expected and poses major challenges to China’s industrial policy for semiconductors. There is no doubt that China will respond with an updated strategy and new tactics. Some elements of this are already underway. This response is the focus of Section 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;section-3-chinas-strategic-objectives-in-responding-to-october-7&quot;&gt;Section 3: China’s Strategic Objectives in Responding to October 7&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the wake of October 7, China is pursuing four strategic objectives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Limiting China’s exposure to foreign economic pressure&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deterring future U.S. and allied economic pressure&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Increasing international economic dependence upon China&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gaining the economic and security benefits of AI.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;limiting-chinas-exposure-to-foreign-pressure&quot;&gt;Limiting China’s Exposure to Foreign Pressure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the relevant economic pressure topic is covered in Section 1, but there is an additional issue worth raising: the risk of an all-out semiconductor embargo by the United States and potentially U.S. allies as well. China imported more than $350 billion worth of semiconductors in 2020, more in dollar terms than China’s imports of oil. Loss of access to all foreign chips and chip technology would be economically apocalyptic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, multilateral chip export controls would have been apocalyptic for Russia had China not helped to fill the gap for its “no limits” Russian partner. An all-out chip embargo on China is likely in the event of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan and perhaps plausible in some other scenarios, such as a blockade of Taiwan. Given that Xi has reportedly given the Chinese military the goal of being able to invade Taiwan by 2027, this is no doubt a factor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;deterring-future-us-and-allied-economic-pressure&quot;&gt;Deterring Future U.S. and Allied Economic Pressure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the October 7 export controls, a great deal of commentary focused on how China might retaliate. As will be discussed more in Section 4, China is retaliating, and China will continue to retaliate. However, some of this focus on retaliation confuses ends and means. China’s central strategic aim when it comes to AI and semiconductors is not to punish the United States: it is to gain and preserve the strategic benefits of the technologies. The point of retaliation is to deter future action by the United States and its allies, not to score points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The October 7 export controls were a significantly more damaging set of semiconductor sanctions and export controls than those pursued by the Trump Administration. U.S. economic pressure has increased significantly over the past five years (in response to escalating Chinese provocations) and at this point are damaging what China perceives to be its core strategic interests. China had two options if it wants to change U.S. behavior, to either deter or appease. As will be discussed more in Section 4, China has chosen to deter and is undertaking a retaliatory campaign that is more willing to inflict pain upon the United States — even at the cost of pain to China — than during prior disputes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;increasing-foreign-dependence-upon-china&quot;&gt;Increasing Foreign Dependence upon China&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The greatest current source of global dependence upon China in the semiconductor industry is as a customer. This is the natural flip side of the $350 billion in Chinese imports mentioned above. When the flow of chips stops, so does the flow of money, and semiconductor companies need a lot of money. According to 2019 data from the Semiconductor Industry Association, Chinese customers comprised&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;26 percent of chip demand by corporate headquarters of the electronic device maker (e.g., phone, computer, washing machine);&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;35 percent of chip demand by location of electronic device assembly (including foreign-owned firms that perform assembly in China); and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;24 percent of chip demand by location of electronic device end-users.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2021, China was also the world’s largest customer market for semiconductor manufacturing equipment, representing 26 percent of global demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, China’s share of both chip demand and equipment demand has shrunk significantly due to both China’s Covid-19 lockdown restrictions and the October 7 controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has proven willing to cut off access to its customers as a tool of foreign policy, in markets as widely divergent as fishing, wine, and NBA basketball TV broadcasts. Chinese leaders talk openly about their willingness to use conditional market access as a tool of foreign policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Demand-side coercive power only goes so far, though, and China seeks strengthened supply-side coercive power as well. Xi said in April 2020, “we must tighten international production chains’ dependence on China, forming powerful countermeasures and deterrent capabilities based on artificially cutting off supply to foreigners.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has become an important supplier of chips in the world, responsible for 9 percent of global production in 2020, but the Chinese share of global chip production declined significantly during the Covid-19 lockdown years. China’s chip production capacity is concentrated in legacy nodes, defined as 28-nanometer or larger. Legacy chips remain vital for a large set of industries, demand is expected to increase, and China is by far the largest investor in this area. If China succeeds in establishing a dominant position in legacy chips, this could give China genuine coercive power in key market segments such as automotive chips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s most frequently discussed source of near-term coercive power is its dominance of rare-earth metal mining and especially refining capacity, controlling more than 60 percent and 80 percent respectively of global capacity. There’s an important difference, however, between China’s dominance of rare earths and the U.S. dominance of semiconductors. China is vulnerable in semiconductors because it lacks technology and a credible path to acquire it. The United States and its allies are vulnerable in rare earth metals only because they have not shown adequate political will to address the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States’ position in rare earths is analogous to the crisis of Europe’s dependence of Russian natural gas. Europe had all the technology to build additional liquid natural gas shipping terminals and the wealth to acquire foreign sources. It simply had a different strategy of “peace through trade” that ensured no substantive attempt to build out the capacity. However, once Russia invaded Ukraine, the crisis created the necessary political will. Any Chinese move to cut off rare earth metals would spark a rush to develop new mines and new refining capacity — as occurred when China restricted rare earth exports to Japan in 2010. Developing alternative sources is far from instantaneous, but slow normal timelines in mine permitting and refining installation construction and can be vastly accelerated during a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same is not true of China’s pursuit of semiconductor manufacturing equipment. China has been pursuing an intense development effort for more than a decade. After April 2018, that effort morphed into a genuine national security priority with nearly unlimited resources available. Even so, China has relatively little to show for its efforts other than waste and corruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;gaining-the-economic-and-security-benefits-of-ai&quot;&gt;Gaining the Economic and Security Benefits of AI&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With respect to AI, senior leaders in China, including Xi himself, believe that leadership in AI is foundational to the future of military, economic, and geopolitical power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, modern AI has already demonstrated remarkable national security capabilities spanning military, intelligence, surveillance, and propaganda, most recently in the war in Ukraine. For nearly a decade, senior U.S. national security leaders have openly stated that they believe that AI will be the key technology to enable continued U.S. military superiority over China. The recent generative AI revolution makes it clear that continued rapid progress in AI technology is unlikely to slow anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As explained in a previous CSIS report, the purpose of the October 7 export controls was to exploit U.S. control of strategic semiconductor technologies in order to choke off China’s access to future progress in AI, including its national security applications. In fact, many of the policy ideas implemented by the October 7 export controls were recommended 18 months earlier in the final report of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, the Biden administration views export controls on semiconductors as the means to an end. The end is ensuring that the security of the United States and its allies is not threatened by Chinese advances in AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the challenge that China’s leaders are responding to. Retaliation is one tool in that policy response, but it is not the most important one. Section 4 will address the major initiatives that China is undertaking in pursuit of its strategic objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;section-4-china-strikes-back--new-and-old-tactics-for-the-updated-strategy&quot;&gt;Section 4: China Strikes Back — New and Old Tactics for the Updated Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the overall strategy and its goals are broadly similar, China has adopted a combination of new tactics and redoubled efforts on old ones. Though there is more to China’s efforts worthy of consideration, this section will focus on the following five major tactics that China is employing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Evading the new controls and continuing to access foreign technology;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seeking to divide the United States from its allies;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Acquiring foreign technology through industrial espionage and talent recruitment;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pressuring Chinese firms to buy Chinese and eliminate American suppliers; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Retaliating against the United States and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;evading-new-controls-and-continuing-to-access-foreign-technology&quot;&gt;Evading New Controls and Continuing to Access Foreign Technology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the four major categories of exports covered by the October 7 controls, the restrictions on chip-making equipment are by far the easiest to enforce. The equipment is large, extremely expensive, and requires a massive amount of post-sales support. These are all features that make export controls easier to enforce. By contrast, AI chips are small, lightweight, and may require no post sales support whatsoever. That makes them an ideal target for smuggling. While no confirmed cases of post-October 7 AI chip smuggling have been reported, chip smuggling has long been a familiar practice in China. In December 2022, a woman was arrested by Chinese customs officials for attempting to smuggle 202 chips inside a false pregnancy belly, though she was trying to avoid Chinese import duties, not evade U.S. export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A U.S. government official told CSIS that China is “definitely” attempting to evade the controls or even outright smuggle the chips. This is easy in small quantities but considerably tougher to accomplish at the needed scale for training large AI models. A small set of hyperscale cloud operators and datacenter providers constitute the vast majority of global demand for the most advanced AI chips. That makes corporate export compliance through “know your customer” and other efforts much easier. Attempting to achieve the necessary scale by aggregating many small purchases through shell companies is possible but would be a slow and laborious process. The U.S. government has also stepped up intelligence community support for export controls enforcement, which should aid the likelihood of catching smugglers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in recent weeks, China has begun a crackdown on the foreign consulting firms that support corporate due diligence efforts, including those related to identifying shell companies and other measures to complying with U.S. export controls and sanctions. As the U.S. government and U.S. firms are trying to gather more information that will allow them to precisely target de-risking efforts, China is taking a classically authoritarian approach that is making that more difficult. There is almost certainly more to come in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more pressing Chinese tactic for avoiding the controls is accessing computing capacity through the cloud. Since the regulations target geographic destination and not corporate ownership, it remains entirely legal for Chinese AI companies to import the chips to their subsidiaries in, say, India and then allow Chinese programmers in China to access the computing capacity via the cloud. As predicted in a previous CSIS report, this is indeed occurring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Chinese AI companies can simply absorb the performance hit of using chips that comply with the export control performance thresholds, which require chips to meet a dual threshold across processing power and interconnect speed. Nvidia, a leading provider of chips for training AI models, has released reduced interconnect variants of its best AI chips that can legally be exported to China. Lennart Heim of the Centre for the Governance of AI has estimated that the overall performance penalty for using one of these chips compared with the international market model is less than 10 percent. That is certainly tolerable for well-resourced Chinese AI companies and national security organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;seeking-to-divide-the-united-states-from-its-allies&quot;&gt;Seeking to Divide the United States from Its Allies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four countries — the United States, Japan, the Netherlands, and South Korea — are responsible for the vast majority of global semiconductor equipment sales. Unsurprisingly, as soon as the United States announced the October 7 controls, Chinese firms began courting equipment makers in the other countries. China’s government also began pressuring the other countries to not go along with the U.S. controls. In the case of the Netherlands and Japan, that pressure continues even now. Only days after Japan submitted draft export control regulations for public comment, Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang told his Japanese counterpart, Yoshimasa Hayashi, that,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The US once brutally contained Japan’s semi-conductor industry by resorting to bullying practices. Today the US has repeated its tricks on China. As the saying goes, do not do unto others what you don’t want done unto you. As the keenly-felt pain still stings, Japan should not help a villain do evil. The blockade will only further stimulate China’s determination for independence and self-development.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, in a March 20 interview with a Dutch newspaper, Tan Jian, China’s ambassador to the Netherlands said, “This will not be without consequences. I’m not going to speculate on countermeasures, but China won’t just swallow this.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the Netherlands and Japan have already made plans to join the United States in placing export controls on advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment, the real audience for these threats is likely South Korea, Germany, and the European Union, which have yet to join the multilateral export control regime and may weigh the severity of China’s actions toward Japan and the Netherlands in their choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea is the most important country to add to the equipment export controls. South Korea is a small but sophisticated player in the global semiconductor manufacturing market, with roughly 5 percent global market share. Though South Korean equipment firms are generally less advanced than those of the other three countries, South Korean equipment companies are significantly more advanced than those of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea also has deep linkages to the Chinese semiconductor industry. South Korea’s two largest memory producers, Samsung and SK Hynix both have a significant share of their global memory production located in China, and both operate facilities worth tens of billions of dollars that make chips sophisticated enough to be subject to U.S. export controls. Ironically, these firms are also subject to Chinese export controls, which prohibit the South Korean firms from moving the tens of billions of dollars’ worth of equipment (none of which was built by China) out of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, South Korea has reasons to be grateful for the October 7 export control policy. The controls were a massive setback to key Chinese competitors: memory chipmakers YMTC (NAND) and CXMT (DRAM). In the days after the October 7 export controls, the stocks of both Samsung and SK Hynix increased significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, planned Samsung and SK Hynix production capacity expansion that would have been built in China is now planned for construction on Korean soil. Next year, South Korea is forecast to overtake China as the world’s largest buyer of semiconductor manufacturing equipment. This will presumably delight the South Korean government, which has fretted about its growing trade deficit with China. Semiconductors alone comprise nearly 20 percent of South Korea’s total exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The production shift back to South Korea is probably also in the best interest of Samsung and SK Hynix. Industry officials told CSIS that Chinese talent poaching from Samsung’s and SK Hynix’s Chinese production facilities played a major role in the rapid technological ascent of both YMTC and CXMT. If operating leading-edge facilities in China requires training the workforce of your future Chinese competitors, Samsung and SK Hynix will certainly view that as a less attractive option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both China and the United States are actively seeking to sway South Korea’s government to their side in the export controls dispute. However, the United States likely has the edge. In addition to the above-mentioned benefits, South Korea’s government has recently pursued closer ties with both the United States and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;acquiring-foreign-technology-through-industrial-espionage-and-talent-recruitment&quot;&gt;Acquiring Foreign Technology through Industrial Espionage and Talent Recruitment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industrial espionage has been a part of the semiconductor industry nearly since its inception. In a declassified Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) report from 1977, the CIA wrote that the Soviet Union’s attempt to steal and copy semiconductor manufacturing equipment technology “dwarfs all of their other known illegal purchase efforts.” Of course, the CIA viewed it as a critical U.S. priority to ensure that Soviet acquisition efforts failed, writing that “if the USSR acquires all the equipment that has been ordered, plus manufacturing know-how and training . . . this capability would elevate the USSR to the status of a major world producer of ICs, trailing only Japan and the United States.” Fortunately for the CIA and the United States, the Soviet Union did fail to acquire a complete set of advanced equipment and the knowhow needed to effectively operate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent decades, some industry players have expressed skepticism that industrial espionage is an effective tool, given the importance of tacit knowledge among skilled organizations and workers. Roger Dassen, the Chief Financial Officer of the Dutch lithography equipment firm ASML, said recently that “A lot of ASML’s technology is not on blueprints. It’s in the heads of people. And you don’t need just the blueprints; you need everything surrounding it and the entire supply chain . . . You’re talking about a decade or more before you could replicate something like this.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether or not Dassen is correct, China is clearly trying to steal ASML’s blueprints and much more. ASML’s CEO said in March of this year that ASML has faced thousands of security incidents each year, forcing the company to increase spending on cybersecurity and other protections by a “significant double digit” percentage for multiple years in a row. In a 2018 trial against a former ASML employee who left the company after successfully stealing source code and providing it to Chinese competitors, ASML’s lead attorney said that the theft represented “a plot to get technology for the Chinese government.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This view was echoed by the Dutch national intelligence agency, which in its 2023 annual report called China “the biggest threat to the Netherlands’ economic security.” In a 2023 interview with the Associated Press, the head of the agency said, “We see that every day they try to steal [technology] from the Netherlands.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ASML is far from the only semiconductor firm that has been subject to repeated and brazen Chinese attempts to steal technology, whether via cyber espionage or by recruiting employees to steal from their employers. In the U.S. memory chip-maker Micron has been the victim of massive theft and knowledge transfer to Chinese competitor Fujian Jinhua. Contrary to those who claim that espionage is not an effective tool in the semiconductor industry, Fujian Jinhua was able to quickly introduce a DRAM product line that used Micron’s “1x-nm” technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the greatest challenge is for the semiconductor industry of Taiwan. Officials in Taiwan told CSIS that Chinese design firms are often willing to pay Taiwanese engineers 500 percent more than they can make in Taiwan. One official caveated, however, that “this is not a job for life. China will suck the knowledge out of your brain and then fire you, and no Taiwanese firm will hire you back after working for China.” To get around the stigma, Chinese firms have taken to setting up shell companies in Taiwan and recruiting workers to transfer knowledge to China, without ever requiring them to leave Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to this challenge, Taiwan has introduced new laws designed to strengthen the security of its industry. This even includes setting up a dedicated economic espionage judicial system to speed up trials and convictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Structuring activities to maximize foreign knowledge transfer goes beyond espionage and talent poaching. In interviews, multiple individuals with experience in the semiconductor equipment industry stated that Chinese fabs would often structure their manufacturing operations to run foreign equipment and Chinese-built equipment side by side, operated by the same pool of workers. The Chinese fab workers would then provide feedback to the Chinese equipment companies, advising them how to improve their designs based on their experience with foreign systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;pressuring-chinese-firms-to-buy-chinese-and-eliminate-american-suppliers&quot;&gt;Pressuring Chinese Firms to Buy Chinese and Eliminate American Suppliers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When considering the challenge of advancing China’s level of semiconductor equipment technology, the two biggest advantages that Chinese firms have is that (1) they do not have to do de novo innovation and (2) that they enjoy a lot of state financial support. Regarding the former, Chinese firms do not have to explore the full range of possible technological paths because the correct solution (or at least a correct solution) path has already been discovered by foreign firms. They can focus R&amp;amp;D resources on a single direction that they know can work. Regarding the latter, Chinese equipment can be competitive on price even when it is not competitive on performance and reliability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest disadvantage that Chinese firms have is that their competitors’ equipment already works and has terrific performance, which makes even Chinese fab firms hesitate when picking Chinese equipment providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In slowing the advance of China’s equipment industry, the October 7 export controls were designed to achieve the best of both worlds. In the advanced node segments, Chinese players struggle to get a foothold because they cannot achieve economies of scale until they have a full stack of production equipment technology. In the legacy node segments where Chinese equipment providers have viable product offerings, they will still encounter competition from foreign equipment providers. Legacy equipment products — even those of U.S. firms — are not covered by export controls. International providers offer equipment with performance significantly better than that of Chinese providers. Thus, it is difficult for Chinese equipment providers to achieve relevant economies of scale even in legacy segments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, Chinese equipment providers cannot learn how to make good products until they have a lot of operational market experience, and they cannot gain significant operational experience because few are interested in buying their unattractive products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese leaders have a preferred solution to break this vicious cycle: pressure Chinese fabs to buy Chinese equipment. As Xi said in a speech:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We must firmly grasp this strategic basis that is demand expansion, make each link — production, distribution, circulation and consumption — rely more on the domestic market to achieve a virtuous circle, specify the strategic direction of supply-side structural reform, and promote the achievement of dynamic balance between aggregate supply and demand at higher levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;History gives good cause for skepticism of the Chinese government’s goals. The Made in China 2025 roadmap anticipated that by 2023, Chinese equipment providers would have already mastered large scale production of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) equipment. In reality, China’s leading lithography company, the Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment group (SMEE) is only producing prototype machines equivalent to what ASML was producing at scale a decade and a half ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This “all-Chinese” supply chain is also the goal of some influential Chinese firms, including Huawei. In March 2023, Huawei’s chairman said, “For Huawei, we will render our support to all such self-saving, self-strengthening and self-reliance efforts of the Chinese semiconductor industry.” Huawei recently announced that it had collaborated with other Chinese firms to create new chip design software for chips at the 14nm node or above. If the tools are successfully verified, which Huawei stated would happen this year, it would provide a Chinese competitor to the U.S. dominant firms in the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the equipment space, Chinese equipment firms will likely supply a majority of the new equipment for fabs producing at the 90nm node or above, according to CSIS discussions with industry executives. However, the executives were skeptical that Chinese equipment firms could supply even 5 percent of the market at the 28nm node within 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese government pressure to “buy Chinese” appears to be extending beyond equipment to the chips themselves. At a recent visit to Xuzhou Construction Machinery Group, General Secretary Xi Jinping asked the corporate delegation, “Are the chips in your crane all made locally?” The Chinese government has also launched a campaign to pressure Chinese automakers to dramatically increase their purchases of Chinese-made chips. Currently, only 5 percent of the chips in Chinese cars are made in China, despite many automotive chips being made at legacy nodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s leaders recognize that it cannot build an all-Chinese semiconductor supply chain overnight, but they are seeking to bolster domestic demand and supply simultaneously by focusing on legacy chips and chipmaking equipment, which does appear to mark a new tactic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, one U.S. semiconductor executive told CSIS in an interview that the Chinese government’s actions matter less than those of the United States: “The Chinese government doesn’t even need to have a ‘no American chips’ policy,” the executive said. “The U.S. government’s actions are plenty frightening to persuade Chinese firms that they should avoid buying American unless they absolutely have to.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combined, this suggests that China is exploring the approach advocated by Lu Feng, a professor at the Peking University School of Government. In a 2023 interview, Lu argued that China should pursue a strategy of “fully independent manufacturing” in two steps. The first step is “de-Americanization of the production lines,” buying Chinese wherever possible, then from U.S. allies, and only from the United States if necessary. The second step is “replace all foreign equipment and materials with domestically made equipment and materials.” Lu argues that the key to this strategy is not to pursue individual technologies — a major focus of prior Chinese industrial policies — but instead to establish linkages between Chinese players in all segments of the value chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;retaliating-against-the-united-states-and-its-allies&quot;&gt;Retaliating against the United States and Its Allies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, China is retaliating. Thus far, this retaliation is taking place in two areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, China is using its anti-trust enforcement regime as a block on essentially all mergers and acquisitions involving U.S. semiconductor industry firms. China has employed anti-trust measures to prevent U.S. mergers before, but a December 2022 analysis by the law firm Skadden finds that “Of the thousands of deals that China has reviewed, only three (less than 0.01%) have been prohibited . . . nearly all of the prohibitions, conditional approvals, and abandonments over the past 10 years have occurred in the technology sectors that are important to China’s national growth, such as semiconductors.” Five months later, the Wall Street Journal reported that essentially all semiconductor mergers involving U.S. companies were being significantly slowed or blocked outright. For semiconductor anti-trust reviews, China has taken things from bad to worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, China has initiated a cybersecurity review of Micron, the largest U.S. memory chipmaker. In an analysis of the Micron case, Graham Webster, chief of the DigiChina Project at the Stanford University Cyber Policy Center, writes that “the prevalence of Chinese commentary identifying Micron as a company particularly unfriendly to China is important in understanding the context for its cybersecurity review.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Micron fails its cybersecurity review, it could be forced out of the Chinese memory market entirely, a potential loss of $3.3 billion in annual sales. At this point, that outcome seems likely. In addition to being fully consistent with a “de-Americanization” approach, excluding Micron could further benefit the company’s South Korean competitors, Samsung and SK Hynix. It may be that China is using this as a potential diplomatic carrot for South Korea to not join the U.S. export controls regime, in addition to the threatened use of sticks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the anti-trust blocking and the Micron review — especially if Micron is ultimately excluded from the Chinese market — are genuinely more significant retaliatory responses than China has taken in the past during, for example, the ZTE dispute. China clearly feels a need to send a more significant signal to deter further U.S. or allied action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it is possible that China will ultimately widen the retaliatory measures to additional areas, such as exports of rare earth metals. Thus far, however, China appears to have calculated that such measures would do more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;October 7 was a watershed moment in the history of U.S.-China relations, and the international community is still reorganizing itself in the wake of a new U.S. and allied approach of “de-risking” exposure to China. China is adapting to this changed environment, but perhaps with fewer changes than some expected. This serves as evidence that the Biden administration’s calculations in launching the new policy were generally correct, at least as they concerned the semiconductor industry: U.S. allies got on board, and China had few good options to respond beyond their already extremely aggressive policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weakest link in the new policy, however, is in achieving its primary stated purpose: blunting China’s military adoption of AI technology. That will require strengthened multilateral export control enforcement capacity to prevent chip smuggling, as well as a means of dealing with China’s ability to access needed AI computing resources through the cloud and by purchasing adequately advanced AI chips that comply with the October 7 performance thresholds. Generally, however, this is unsurprising. Technology markets change rapidly, and the only export control regime that has a chance of being effective is one that keeps up with the pace of change.&lt;/p&gt;

A few days later, Russian forces attacked the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) – the first instance of an operational nuclear power plant (NPP) directly targeted as part of a military operation.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;Over the past year, Russia’s military activity in Ukraine has resulted in serious threats to the safety and security of Ukraine’s nuclear infrastructure, and there is good reason to believe that Russia has violated the protections granted to NPPs in international humanitarian law (IHL). Given the significant projected global increase in the number of nuclear reactors over the coming decades, it is likely that this will not be the last time NPPs are in the midst of military conflict. This report seeks to assess the risks the ongoing war poses to NPPs in Ukraine and to draw preliminary conclusions from these events to improve the safety and security of NPPs in conflict.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The greatest threat to Ukraine’s NPPs is unlikely to be from a direct strike on a reactor and an ensuing large-scale radiological incident similar to the 1986 Chornobyl disaster, but rather the failure of key systems – namely, water and energy supply – or human error, potentially resulting in an incident not unlike what occurred at Fukushima Daiichi NPP in 2011. The threat of direct strike is more of a concern when it comes to the pool-type spent nuclear fuel storage or the sarcophagus containing the remnants of the destroyed Unit 4 at the ChNPP, which are not designed to be as robust as the containment structures over the operating reactors. There is also a risk that Ukraine may run out of available storage for its used nuclear fuel as it cannot currently transport spent fuel safely. Finally, the possibility that Russia may manufacture a radiological incident at the ZNPP or another facility to spoil a Ukrainian offensive should not be disregarded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report makes three sets of recommendations. The first relates to mitigating the immediate risks posed to nuclear infrastructure in Ukraine. The second relates to strengthening regulations, standards and other considerations to mitigate against potential threats to nuclear safety and security in conflict. The third relates to the conduct of military operations around NPPs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To improve nuclear safety and security in Ukraine, the international community should:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ensure the personal safety and welfare of staff at NPPs, including sufficient staffing levels.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ensure sufficient licensed Ukrainian staff are ready to resume operations at the ZNPP following Russian withdrawal from the facility.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Facilitate the safe transport of spent nuclear fuel to dry-storage facilities, where appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assess availability of highly radioactive waste storage facilities and certify additional storage if needed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provide chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear, emergency response and other necessary equipment, training and support to the Ukrainian military, emergency services and NPP operators.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provide regular updates on the supply of fuel for emergency generators at Ukrainian nuclear facilities, as well as the water levels in the Kakhovka Reservoir.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ensure the safe supply of diesel fuel, maintenance parts and services, and other materials necessary for the safe operation of Ukraine’s NPPs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Penalise Rosatom staff operating at the ZNPP for participating in Russia’s occupation of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Establish deterrence against a deliberately manufactured radiological incident by making clear to Russia that any such incident would be followed by a massive response to mitigate damage and expanded support for Ukraine’s war effort.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To mitigate against potential threats to nuclear safety and security in future conflict, the international community should:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider, and adopt the necessary prevention and mitigation measures for, state-level military conflict and occupation of nuclear facilities by an invading force as part of national threat assessments, design-basis threats and wider national defence and security planning.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Include considerations on military attack and occupation of nuclear facilities in the International Atomic Energy Agency’s nuclear safety and security standards.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Harden physical protections in the design of new NPPs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Harden existing NPPs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure the safety and security of NPPs in areas of active operations, the international community should:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Establish a 1-km demilitarised zone around NPPs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Grant special protected status to critical NPP safety, security and emergency response systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Define an obligation for the establishment of deconfliction lines by militaries operating around NPPs, as well as the nuclear regulators or other responsible authorities in the concerned states.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Establish regulations relating to effects of cyber and electromagnetic activities applied in the vicinity of NPPs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022 led to widespread fears over the safety and security of nuclear power plants (NPPs) after Russian forces occupied two of Ukraine’s five NPPs, struck a nuclear research reactor in Kharkiv and severed power to a research reactor in Kyiv. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is the first time that operational NPPs have been the direct objectives of military operations. There are strong reasons to believe that similar challenges are likely to feature in future conflicts. The number of NPPs is expanding globally, and this may accelerate as countries seek to generate power while reducing their carbon emissions. As NPPs become a more prevalent source of energy production, and as energy itself becomes ever-more critical to the wider functioning of societies, warring states will likely seek to exert control over them. It is therefore important to consider how the international community should maximise the safety of NPPs in a conflict context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report aims to consolidate three interrelated discussions. First, it seeks to provide an overview of the safety risks extant in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, what the Ukrainian state has learned from its experiences and what measures may improve the safety of its NPPs during the ongoing conflict. Second, the report seeks to summarise civilian and military actors’ existing obligations and approaches towards NPPs and identify conflicting imperatives that could expose NPPs to risk in future conflicts. Third, the report makes recommendations as to how states can improve the safety and security of their NPPs and how militaries should think about operating around these objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology-and-definitions&quot;&gt;Methodology and Definitions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The methodology for this report involves four strands. First, the authors interviewed staff from Ukraine’s NPPs, officials involved in Ukraine’s energy infrastructure and governance, security officials responsible for assessing threats to Ukraine’s NPPs, National Guard personnel responsible for the physical protection of the NPPs, and military personnel conducting operations in the vicinity of Ukraine’s NPPs. The authors carried out many of these interviews in Ukraine in March 2023. Second, the report draws on physical inspection of Ukrainian nuclear facilities and observation of operations conducted in their vicinity in the summer of 2022. Third, the report draws on a review of publicly available information and assessments of the safety and security of Ukraine’s nuclear infrastructure – before and since February 2022 – produced by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Ukrainian authorities and other experts. Fourth, the report draws on a comparative survey of military doctrine and the historical record of military operations affecting NPPs both directly and indirectly. Academic literature and expert commentary and analysis on nuclear safety and security in conflict, including in the ongoing war in Ukraine, also informed this report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report is structured in three parts. The first is a narrative account and analysis of the safety and security issues that have arisen during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The second surveys the extant governance of safety at NPPs, existing international standards relating to NPPs in conflict zones and the perspective of militaries as to how NPPs are relevant to military operations. The third outlines recommendations for how NPPs can be rendered safer in conflict scenarios and how militaries can best ensure this during operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The terms ‘nuclear safety’ and ‘nuclear security’ are used in this report according to their IAEA definitions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nuclear safety refers to: ‘The achievement of proper operating conditions, prevention of accidents and mitigation of accident consequences, resulting in protection of workers, the public and the environment from undue radiation risks’.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nuclear security refers to: ‘The prevention and detection of, and response to, criminal or intentional unauthorized acts involving nuclear material, other radioactive material, associated facilities or associated activities’ and ‘The prevention and detection of, and response to, theft, sabotage, unauthorized access, illegal transfer or other malicious acts involving nuclear material, other radioactive material or their associated facilities’.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of attacks on NPPs or supporting infrastructure during a military conflict, the distinction between nuclear safety and security can become blurred. Where either term may be relevant, the authors have used them together. When the discussion exclusively concerns one or the other, the terms have been used according to the above definitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The subject of nuclear safety and security encompasses a broad range of issues, not all of which are covered in this report. The report’s primary focus is the threats to the safe operation of civilian nuclear facilities and to the physical integrity of nuclear facilities in conflict – and in the Ukrainian context in particular – with a view to understanding whether and how military operations may directly result in a radiological incident. As such, nuclear and radiological security issues as they pertain to the unauthorised removal of material from facilities – as well as matters related to unauthorised access to facilities, other than as part of military occupation of a facility – have been largely excluded from this report. Considerations of the application of IAEA safeguards at Ukrainian facilities are also not treated here. That is not to say that these matters are not relevant when discussing nuclear safety and security in the context of the war in Ukraine; in fact, there are serious, justified concerns over these issues. However, these were judged to be outside of this report’s scope and deserve to be treated comprehensively in a separate publication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;risks-to-nuclear-safety-and-security-in-ukraine&quot;&gt;Risks to Nuclear Safety and Security in Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the full-scale Russian invasion in February 2022, more than 50% of Ukraine’s domestic energy supply came from NPPs. The country hosts 15 operational nuclear reactors for energy generation, with an additional two reactors located at research facilities and four reactors in permanent shutdown at Chornobyl. As such, the significant likelihood and impact of attacks on the country’s nuclear infrastructure as part of the Russian invasion should have been evident from the start. In fact, the capture of Ukraine’s NPPs was a key objective in Russian military planning for the invasion. The Chornobyl NPP (ChNPP) and surrounding Exclusion Zone – the site of the 1986 nuclear disaster – is located on Ukraine’s border with Belarus and straddled the Russian military’s axis of advance from Gomel to Kyiv. Despite this, the Ukrainian government does not appear to have significantly adjusted its forces to defend its NPPs in the lead-up to the full-scale invasion, nor could the authors ascertain the existence of any extant procedures for defending the country’s operating NPPs under the conditions of a military conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The physical protection of Ukraine’s critical national infrastructure (CNI) – including its NPPs – is the responsibility of the National Guard of Ukraine, a unit of which is stationed at each NPP. Until the full-scale invasion, these units were structured, trained and equipped primarily to protect facilities from terrorist threats, theft and sabotage. This is largely in line with international standards, as the defence of NPPs against an invading military is not covered by the international nuclear safety and security regime. Ukraine had conducted a design-basis threat (DBT) for nuclear facilities, nuclear material, radioactive waste and other radiation sources in August 2015 and reportedly took into account the threats emanating from the Russian incursion into Donbas. DBTs for individual NPPs were also conducted in recent years. The authors also heard that an updated DBT assessment was apparently completed in 2022 but may not have been approved as of early 2023. The sensitive nature of these assessments has also meant that the authors could not confirm what specific threats were identified in 2015 or more recently. DBTs normally include only those threats to a nuclear facility’s physical security that the facility’s operator can reasonably address and focus on unauthorised access to the facility, sabotage, terrorist attack or theft of material. Defence against military attack is generally deemed to be beyond the DBT and is the primary responsibility of state authorities, and should be addressed as part of the country’s wider defence and security planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is clear that Ukrainian authorities were aware of threats to the security of nuclear facilities and material in the country following Russia’s annexation of Crimea and the breakout of military activity in eastern Ukraine in 2014. In its ‘National Progress Report’ to the 2016 Nuclear Security Summit, Ukraine outlined efforts it had taken to strengthen the physical protection of nuclear facilities, nuclear material, radioactive waste and other sources of ionizing radiation. However, based on the threats and mitigation measures addressed in that report, the primary focus appears to have been dealing with lower-level threats such as political instability and sabotage, not accounting for a Russian military assault on – or occupation of – NPPs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its 2021 report on the state of nuclear and radiological safety in Ukraine, the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine (SNRIU) noted that its assessment of threats to the physical protection of nuclear facilities and material in Ukraine considered Russian military activity in eastern Ukraine and ‘hybrid’ socio-political threats. According to the report, measures were taken to strengthen the physical protection of facilities and radioactive material in transport, facility access control was improved, and protection personnel underwent training for countering terrorism and sabotage threats. The report also highlighted the role of the National Guard in the protection of nuclear facilities and noted that inspections carried out that year concluded that the detachments responsible for NPP protection demonstrated ‘sufficient levels of readiness to perform their obligations in the prevention of acts of terrorism or sabotage against NPPs’. The authors could not ascertain any assessment as to the preparedness of the National Guard, or any other national preparations, to defend against full-scale military attack on facilities; although, due to its sensitive nature, such information is unlikely to be reported publicly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The apparent failure to put in place a more substantial defence of NPPs against invading forces raises questions. Speaking to personnel responsible for the safety and security of Ukraine’s NPPs, it is evident that they had not enacted special measures in anticipation of conflict prior to 24 February 2022. The fact that senior Russian agents in Ukraine had obscured the threat to the Ukrainian authorities may partly explain this. Ukraine’s state security service (SBU) and the US government accuse Andriy Derkach, former head of the state enterprise Energoatom, of working as a long-term Russian agent along with senior SBU officers including Brigadier General Andriy Naumov who was also involved in the security of Ukraine’s energy infrastructure. Perhaps reflecting this internal distortion of the Ukrainian state’s risk perception, Ukraine’s minister of energy stated, not long before Russian forces captured the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), that the facility did not face a serious threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crossing into Ukraine from Belarus on the morning of 24 February, Russian military forces seized the ChNPP within hours. As the Russians approached the NPP, Valentin Vitter, deputy head of security of the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone, called the National Guard detachment responsible for the protection of the NPP and ordered its surrender, citing the risk to the station as the combined arms armies of Russia’s Eastern Military District rolled over the border. As a senior officer in the unit noted, ‘we were facing down a Blitzkrieg with pistols’. Two things quickly became evident: Moscow had long planned to seize the site; and the Russian military was woefully unprepared for operating around a nuclear facility. Russia’s special services seized the plant’s archives and all data held at the facility. The Ukrainian workforce was held hostage to maintain facility operations. Russian troops proceeded to establish a command post and supply base in close proximity to the NPP. Given the plentiful availability of structures suitable for establishing command and supply activities within the 30-km Exclusion Zone, the authors assess the decision to site these functions by the NPP to have been deliberate, and with the aim of using the facility as a shield. Alongside these clearly planned actions, Russian units dug trenches within the Exclusion Zone, digging up radioactive particles that had settled into the soil since the 1986 disaster, dragging them around the site and facility buildings and raising the radiation levels in the zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 3 March, Russian forces from the Southern Military District had reached the ZNPP and set about occupying the facility. Ukrainian forces marked the facility with spotlights at night, shining them directly upwards in an attempt to indicate its location for troops. Despite these measures, Russian forces hit the site’s training facility with tank rounds and caused a fire. The risk to the civilian population in the nearby towns from conducting active military defence of the NPP led the National Guard unit tasked with defending the facility to withdraw. As at the ChNPP, the Russians rapidly set about placing military supply vehicles and command-and-control systems in the ZNPP’s immediate vicinity. According to the IAEA, military equipment and stores were still present within the turbine halls of ZNPP Units 1 and 2 as of February 2023. Ukrainian plant employees were forced to continue operating the facility without rotation and under duress, with some being detained by Russian forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Russian forces departed from the ChNPP at the end of March 2022, the ZNPP remains under Russian control at the time of writing. The ongoing military operations around the facility, as well as the broader state of war across the country, pose significant threats to nuclear safety and security in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;assessing-safety-and-security-risks-during-the-invasion&quot;&gt;Assessing Safety and Security Risks During the Invasion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The threats that the military invasion posed to Ukraine’s nuclear facilities became clear immediately, with additional risks becoming apparent over time. On the day of the invasion and Russia’s seizure of the ChNPP, the IAEA lost connection with the site’s radiation monitoring network. Two days later, on 26 February, the ZNPP lost power supply from one of its four external power lines. On 4 March, Russian forces took control of the ZNPP and – as described earlier – a projectile struck the plant’s on-site training facility, resulting in a localised fire breaking out a few hundred metres from the reactor units. On 6 March, the ZNPP lost power supply from another one of its external power lines. Many other incidents have occurred over the past 15 months that have placed the safety and security of Ukrainian nuclear facilities at risk and raised international concerns over potential consequences. More recently, a Russian mine reportedly exploded near the engine room of a ZNPP reactor unit, and IAEA personnel stationed at the ZNPP in mid-April 2023 have reported hearing daily shelling. The risks of both an accidental and intentional radiological incident are considered below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strikes on Reactor Units&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1986 disaster at the ChNPP still looms large in public memory; as such, it is unsurprising that the accident has repeatedly been used as a point of reference when the potential consequences of Ukraine’s NPPs getting caught in the crossfire of the ongoing conflict are discussed. However, the likelihood of a 1986-scale disaster is low. Unlike the graphite-moderated RBMK (reaktor bolshoy moschnosti kanal’niy, high-power channel-type reactor) reactors at Chornobyl – now all decommissioned – Ukraine’s operating NPPs host water-cooled and moderated VVER (vodo-vodyanoi energeticheskiy reaktor, water-water power reactor) reactors, which are much less prone to some of the factors resulting from reactor malfunction and human error that caused and exacerbated the Chornobyl accident. The release and dispersion of highly radioactive material at a scale comparable to the Chornobyl disaster would require the penetration of a facility housing radioactive material – namely, a reactor or a spent-fuel storage facility – and the large-scale release of that material into the atmosphere and surrounding environment, likely assisted by plumes of smoke from a fire. While this is technically possible, the authors judge it to be unlikely for reasons described below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An accidental hit on a reactor unit or a dry spent-fuel storage facility under the current state of military activity around Ukrainian NPPs is unlikely to cause a major radiological incident. The reactors currently operating at Ukrainian NPPs are located within reinforced containment structures, as per IAEA standards. These structures are designed to withstand significant internal and external hazards, including fires, explosions, earthquakes and radioactive release from other accidents. When it comes to loads from external impacts, the IAEA standards require reactor containment structures to be robust enough to withstand the force of an aircraft crashing into them. Ukraine’s dry spent-fuel storage facilities at the ZNPP and ChNPP are also protected in reinforced concrete structures. According to one recent ZNPP employee, a control cask at the NPP’s dry fuel storage – used to monitor the state of the other casks at the facility over time – was struck by artillery shrapnel during an exchange of fire but did not sustain significant damage. The authors could not verify the accuracy of this account, but it is consistent with expert analysis of the threat to dry spent-fuel storage from external impact. Furthermore, the spent fuel in dry storage facilities has been cooled for some time and is therefore significantly less radioactive than fuel inside a reactor core or the more recently withdrawn spent fuel stored in pool-type wet storage facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artillery fire, which has been the primary military threat to Ukraine’s NPPs since the full-scale invasion, is unlikely to cause any serious damage to the integrity of the containment or dry spent-fuel storage structures. The most widely employed fires throughout the conflict have been high-explosive artillery rounds intended to deliver fragmentation and overpressure effects against enemy personnel. Other classes of rounds employed – such as sensor-fused sub-munitions – are designed to find and strike objects with specific characteristics, such as vehicles, and would not be effective against the containment structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Penetrating a containment structure and, subsequently, a reactor core would require applying significant and targeted firepower. Bunker-busting rounds such as HESH (high-explosive squash head) munitions, armour-piercing rounds including APFSDS (armour-piercing fin-stabilised discarding sabot) kinetic penetrators and other direct-fire weapons including anti-tank guided weapons (ATGWs) could risk compromise to the facility, especially if repeated hits were delivered against the structure. Missiles with warheads intended to destroy hardened structures and especially hypersonic strikes from ballistic missiles could also pose a threat to the facility. Heavy air-delivered ordnance may compromise the containment structure. Nevertheless, this would likely require multiple hits, and since these are precision weapons or weapons employed against specific target classes, their use against an NPP would not be accidental. It is important to note that there is no effective means of preventing hits from ballistic missiles, since air and missile defences can only ensure partial protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, while deliberate compromise of Ukrainian reactor units or dry spent-fuel storage facilities resulting in a significant radiological incident is possible, incidental or accidental compromise is far less likely. The authors judge such an intentional strike unlikely but not unimaginable. Circumstances in which deliberate sabotage of nuclear facilities may occur are discussed later in this report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two facilities at the ChNPP do not benefit from the same level of hardened protection as the reactors and dry storage sites, and may be more likely to sustain serious damage from lighter fire or accidental hits. These are the ChNPP’s Interim Spent Fuel 1 facility (ISF-1) and the New Containment Structure (NCS): the enormous concrete and steel sarcophagus containing the remnants of the reactor at Unit 4, destroyed during the 1986 disaster. Unlike the dry spent-fuel storage facilities at the ChNPP and the ZNPP, ISF-1 – a wet spent-fuel storage facility – is not hardened or housed within a reinforced containment structure. Constructing a containment structure to protect ISF-1 would be costly, time consuming and impractical to do while hostilities are ongoing and Russian forces and artillery remain stationed just a few kilometres away in Belarus. The most practical solution would be to move the spent fuel from ISF-1 into the significantly better reinforced new dry spent-fuel storage facility – ISF-2 at the ChNPP. In fact, the transfer of spent fuel from ISF-1 to ISF-2 began in November 2020, as the former is not designed for long-term fuel storage and is running out of space to accept new spent fuel. The process was expected to take 10 years under peacetime conditions. However, transfer of fuel stopped after the full-scale invasion. As the ChNPP is located within range of Russian artillery, moving fuel between the two facilities has been deemed too dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equally, although the NCS over Unit 4 is an impressive and robust structure designed to withstand earthquakes and class-3 tornados, it is not designed to withstand the same kinds of loads or impact as the containment structures of operational reactors. While Unit 4 at ChNPP has not been operational since the 1986 accident, what remains of the reactor is still highly radioactive. The installation of the NCS, which was completed in 2016, is designed to prevent the spread of radioactive particles from the damaged reactor. An attack on, and penetration of, the NCS and the old sarcophagus – which was built hastily over the Unit 4 reactor immediately following the accident and is now enclosed within the NCS – would cause the release of radioactive particles into the surrounding area and atmosphere. One member of the Ukrainian National Guard responsible for the protection of the ChNPP stated such an accident would essentially produce ‘a massive dirty bomb’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Senior staff of the Chornobyl Central Enterprise for the Management of Radioactive Waste raised similar concerns regarding potential attacks on the other radioactive waste storage facilities, such as the one at Buryakivka village in the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone. The authors also heard concerns over Ukraine’s ability to store any radioactive waste that may result from an accident at an NPP – whether at the ChNPP or at any of the country’s other facilities. According to the representatives of the Chornobyl Central Enterprise for the Management of Radioactive Waste, there is currently a shortage of storage for highly radioactive materials in Ukraine. New storage facilities can be constructed but any such effort will require extensive resources, as well as a lengthy risk assessment and other government review and approval processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risks to NPP Power and Water Supply&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The penetration of NPP structures housing radioactive materials by munitions is not the only risk to nuclear safety and security in Ukraine posed by the ongoing conflict. The interruption of systems critical to the safe operation of Ukraine’s NPPs – namely, the supply of water and electricity – creates significant risks and may result in a scenario similar to the 2011 accident at Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi NPP. In that instance, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake caused the automatic shutdown and loss of external power supply at the NPP’s light water reactors. The earthquake was followed by a tsunami, which caused the failure of emergency power generators. With no power available to cool the reactor fuel, the units experienced nuclear fuel meltdown and hydrogen explosions (caused by zirconium reacting with the steam that resulted from rising temperatures in the reactors). Only one of the containment structures housing the NPP’s reactors was breached, releasing radioactive material into the atmosphere. Nevertheless, more than 100,000 people had to be relocated as a result of radioactive contamination in the areas around the reactor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should reactors lose access to electricity or water supply for an extended period, Ukraine’s NPPs may face similar consequences. Since the start of the full-scale invasion and as of the drafting of this report, the ZNPP has lost external power supply six times – most recently on 9 March 2023. The ChNPP lost external power supply on 9 March 2022 and again on 23 November 2022, when Russian attacks on Ukraine’s national electrical grid also resulted in power outages at all of the country’s other NPPs. In all instances, on-site diesel power generators were able to maintain power supply to the reactor units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reliable supply of power is critical for the safe operation of nuclear reactors. Reactor fuel is extremely hot and must be constantly cooled to avoid melting and causing a Fukushima-like nuclear meltdown. The cooling process involves pumping cold water into the first circuit of the reactor and removing hot water with powerful pumps. The heat is then removed using a heat exchange system; at the ZNPP, this process currently relies on water from the Dnipro River. In the case of a power loss, these pumps stop operating, thus halting the circulation of water through the reactor’s first circuit, risking an overheating of the reactor core and subsequent melting of the reactor’s fuel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A constant supply of coolant is needed even when reactors are in cold shutdown – as is the case with four of Ukraine’s 15 power units (one additional ZNPP reactor, previously in hot shutdown, is reportedly also being moved into cold shutdown as of the time of drafting) – as the nuclear fuel remains extremely hot. The same is true of spent fuel which has been removed from a reactor core; depleted fuel assemblies continue to release significant amounts of heat and must be cooled in water for some time before they can be transferred to dry fuel storage. However, as experts have rightly pointed out, the ZNPP reactors have been in shutdown for months, meaning their core temperatures are much lower than those of the reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi NPP at the time of the accident. As a result, they can be expected to remain safe for several days without power supply when in cold shutdown. Ukrainian authorities offered a similar assessment to the authors. The same is true of spent-fuel facilities, as spent nuclear fuel will have had time to cool since it was extracted from the reactors. In the case of dry spent-fuel storage facilities, the spent fuel will have also spent some time in wet storage and had additional time to cool before being transferred to dry storage casks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another risk emanating from a loss of power stems from the need to manage the hydrogen produced by the operation of the reactors to prevent a hydrogen explosion. As a result of radiolysis of the water in the reactor, hydrogen is produced and must be removed from the reactor building. Its removal depends on the operation of powerful turbines, which require a constant supply of power. Should these turbines stop operating, gas build-up may lead to a Fukushima-like hydrogen explosion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the Fukushima accident, Ukrainian NPPs’ safety systems and resistance to accidents were stress tested. The authors reviewed reports detailing the results and found that the tests carried out at the ChNNP and ZNPP were primarily focused on extreme natural events. They also included considerations around the loss of water or power supply in extraordinary conditions, some of which may be relevant to current conditions. A series of recommendations for improving the safety and emergency response systems at the NPPs were put forward following the stress tests, and a National Action Plan for their implementation was developed in 2013. The recommendations included: the placement at NPPs of additional emergency diesel generators and mobile water pumps which can maintain water circulation for heat removal in case of a loss of external power; the strengthening of containment structures; and the installation of radionuclide filters and hydrogen recombiners to reduce the likelihood of hydrogen explosions. As of 2021, 80% of the safety improvement measures outlined in the National Action Plan had been completed, with the rest expected to be finalised by 2024. It is unclear how the Russian invasion has affected this timeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While emergency diesel generators have been able to maintain power supply to Ukraine’s NPPs following every instance of external power supply loss so far, repeatedly relying on backup generators to maintain the safe operation of an NPP is a very dangerous game to play – especially in a conflict situation. The supply of diesel fuel at NPPs is not infinite and may be difficult to replenish if there are challenges in accessing the facility or there is a general diesel shortage across the country. According to one senior Ukrainian government official with responsibility for the country’s chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) defence and security, in early March 2023, the ZNPP had sufficient fuel supply to keep the 18 emergency generators required to maintain power to its six reactor units for about 10 days. This figure is likely an estimate, as Ukrainian authorities have admitted to having limited information on the situation at the Russian-occupied ZNPP and it is possible that Russian personnel have supplied the facility with additional fuel. Fuel levels also vary over time, as fuel is used up by generator operation and new supply is delivered. In November 2022, the IAEA reported that the ZNPP had fuel to operate the diesel generators for about 15 days. The Ukrainian official’s comments and lack of definitive information on the fuel supply highlight the precarious power supply situation at the ZNPP. Emergency systems are also designed to prioritise the safe operation of the NPP, not the supply of power to secondary facilities such as administrative buildings and staff facilities. Loss of external power supply may therefore also pose challenges to staff wellbeing and their ability to conduct their work effectively. Staff morale and wellbeing issues pose a significant risk to the safe operation of NPPs and are discussed later in the report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the threat posed by loss of power to Ukraine’s nuclear reactors, water supply to the ZNPP may also be at risk. In February 2023, the IAEA reported that water levels at the Kakhovka Reservoir on the Dnipro River have been dropping. The reservoir supplies water to the cooling ponds that are part of the system which is used to remove heat from the ZNPP’s reactors and spent-fuel storage facility. Water in the reservoir is normally maintained at a higher level than in the ponds, which facilitates the ponds’ replenishment and maintains reliable supply of water for cooling the reactor and spent-fuel storage, without which the reactor core and spent fuel risk overheating. In a statement in mid-February, Energoatom reported that water levels in the reservoir stood at 13.8 metres – well below their normal 16 metres. At the time, the head of Energoatom, Petro Kotin, stated that ‘a level of 12.8 meters will be [an] emergency, and 12 meters will be critical’. According to the authors’ consultations with two Ukrainian experts in early March 2023, including a recent ZNPP employee, water in the reservoir had by then dropped to below pool levels and may have even fallen below the 12.8-metres mark. The authors could not confirm this independently. As the weather begins to warm in the spring and summer, evaporation from the reservoir and pool may exacerbate the issue. However, in its report from 21 April, the IAEA noted that water levels had returned to 16.2 metres. In an earlier report, the Agency had attributed rising water levels to melting snow over the previous months. One senior expert with intimate knowledge of ZNPP operations consulted by the authors in March 2023 did not perceive the water levels cited at the time to pose an immediate threat to the safe operation of the facility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Staff Wellbeing and Safe Operation of NPPs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another critical threat to the safe operation of the country’s NPPs – which has received significant attention from the IAEA in its public reporting on nuclear safety and security in Ukraine since the full-scale invasion – is the duress under which NPP staff are having to operate. As the IAEA has highlighted, staff across all Ukrainian NPPs are having to carry out their duties while ‘dealing with the burdens imposed on their personal lives by the ongoing armed conflict, as well as with constant stress and anxiety’. Such conditions undoubtedly negatively affect staff’s ability to effectively perform what is – in normal times – high-pressure work that requires precision and the ability to confidently make high-stake decisions. Literature has pointed to the important role that the human factor plays in safe NPP operation. A 2021 report on the state of radiological and nuclear safety in Ukraine notes that 18.5% of abnormal events in NPP operations that year were due to human error. It was 13% the previous year. In 2017, it had peaked as high as 41%. Operating under the stresses of military conflict and occupation risks exacerbating the impact of human error in the operation of Ukraine’s NPPs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situation is particularly acute at the ZNPP. The facility is located on the frontline of the conflict and has been under Russian occupation since early March 2022. As such, the NPP’s Ukrainian staff are having to carry out their duties amid an active war zone and in the presence of Russian military personnel. ZNPP staff on duty when Russian forces invaded the facility were not able to maintain normal rotations. Similarly, ChNPP staff remained on duty indefinitely when the Russian military took over the facility on 24 February 2022. As of March 2023, staff at the occupied ZNPP facility were reportedly being rotated regularly, although still working longer hours and more shifts. Several staff at the ZNPP – including the head of the power plant at the time, Ihor Murashov – have been detained. Media reporting has also recounted instances of torture of ZNPP staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One former ZNPP employee, who had been working at the NPP during the Russian occupation, recounted to the authors the psychological stress staff experienced. According to them, staff movement around the NPP – previously unrestricted – had to be coordinated with units of the Russian National Guard that had been stationed at the NPP after the invasion. At times when fire was being exchanged, NPP staff had to shelter in place – often for hours at a time. The occupying forces also reportedly did not allow staff to vacate technology or personal belongings from the parts of the facility which they moved into. Staff from the ChNPP also told the authors that, on returning to the NPP following Russian withdrawal, they found much of their personal belongings and facility equipment looted. What technology the Russian forces did not take with them from the ChNPP, they apparently destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian state-owned enterprise Rosatom is present at the ZNPP and has taken over management of the facility. The company was also present at the ChNPP during Russia’s occupation of the facility. Ukrainian authorities and experts, as well as the former ZNPP employee, confirmed to the authors that Rosatom has been forcing Ukrainian staff at the ZNPP to sign contracts with the company to retain their jobs (although it appears that Rosatom may have recently stopped requiring Ukrainian staff to be employed by the enterprise to continue working at the plant, presumably to mitigate staff shortages). Many Ukrainian staff refused and left employment at the ZNPP. Others have left the ZNPP and the nearby town of Energodar due to the obvious threats to safety and security inherent to an active conflict zone. Those that have chosen to continue working at the ZNPP face pressure – and may risk penalties – from Ukrainian authorities for collaborating with Russia. Despite reported attempts by Rosatom to recruit replacement staff – including nuclear experts from Russia – staff levels at the ZNPP are significantly below pre-invasion levels. Prior to the February 2022 invasion, the ZNPP hosted, by various accounts, between 10,000 and 11,000 staff; by the start of 2023, only 3,000 personnel reportedly remained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each reactor is unique and requires highly specialised staff specifically licensed to operate a given facility, making the replacement of ZNPP staff challenging. A number of Ukrainian experts also highlighted to the authors that the originally Soviet-designed ZNPP control rooms have since been modernised and differ significantly from Russian facilities, apparently making them challenging to navigate for Russian staff not trained to operate them. Finally, the threat of being sanctioned for participating in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine appears to be deterring potential replacement personnel from taking up employment at the ZNPP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that, prior to the invasion, the ZNPP was operating with some redundancy in its staffing, and that certain staff were carrying out roles that would not have been directly critical to the safe operation of the facility and even less so in its current shutdown state. As such, current staff numbers may technically be sufficient for the operation of the ZNPP in its current state. However, there is no doubt that this significant reduction in staff and expertise creates additional pressures, stress and fatigue for the Ukrainian personnel still working at the ZNPP. Furthermore, the IAEA has reported that changes in the ZNPP management have resulted in ambiguous chains of command and have left staff to contend with conflicting instructions on how to operate the plant. Not only will such working conditions lead to greater levels of fatigue, anxiety and burnout among ZNPP staff than have already been observed, they pose an acute risk to the safe operation of the NPP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Possibly in an attempt to rectify Russian staff’s unfamiliarity with Ukrainian facilities, operators from Russian NPPs have been ‘receiving simulator and on the job training at the ZNPP’ and may be deployed to work at the facility following their training, according to the IAEA. While such an approach may address the challenge of staffing shortages at the ZNPP, it also helps normalise the presence, and continued deployment, of Russian personnel at an illegally occupied facility to replace Ukrainian staff who have left – or been forced out of their positions – as a result of the invasion. Unless expressly endorsed by relevant Ukrainian authorities – which is unlikely – the further deployment of Russian personnel to Ukrainian NPPs should not be acceptable to the international community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-1-the-iaea-in-ukraine&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 1: The IAEA in Ukraine&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The IAEA’s Incident and Emergency Center (IEC) has been in touch with Ukrainian authorities since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022, and the Agency has been providing consistent technical support to Ukraine throughout the conflict. The IAEA’s Board of Governors has passed three resolutions condemning Russian activities at Ukrainian nuclear facilities, and has called for Russia to cease its actions ‘against and at nuclear facilities in Ukraine’ and to allow Ukrainian authorities to regain control over its facilities. The IAEA has also been providing regular public updates on the situation in Ukraine, including through short news items on its webpage as well as through the publication of several detailed reports. Director General Rafael Grossi has been spearheading the Agency’s efforts and has articulated ‘Seven Pillars’ of nuclear safety and security in Ukraine derived from existing IAEA safety and security principles. The pillars include – and go beyond – many of the safety and security threats covered in this report. In September 2022, the Agency also put forward a list of seven recommendations to address the threat to nuclear safety and security in Ukraine, which included a call for the establishment of a nuclear safety and security zone around the ZNPP. However, the IAEA appears to have recently moved away from the idea of securing such a zone and is focusing on the protection of the facility itself under the current circumstances. The Seven Pillars and subsequent recommendations for addressing the nuclear safety and security situation in Ukraine provide helpful direction for managing the current situation. However, they are fairly high level in scope and do not consider in any significant detail the military developments on the ground or the operational objectives of the warring parties. The challenges that these realities pose to establishing and enforcing a safety and security zone around the NPP are discussed later in this report.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Agency has also conducted several missions to Ukraine to assess the situation. The IAEA has had a permanent – albeit very limited – presence at the ZNPP since September 2022 and at all Ukrainian NPPs since January 2023. These IAEA Support and Assistance Missions consist of two–four IAEA staff and normally rotate every four–five weeks. However, it appears that the IAEA has recently encountered challenges in rotating its staff at the ZNPP. The mission teams are able to review the various aspects of facility operations and equipment related to safety and security – including the operation of diesel generators and supply of generator fuel, as well as facility connection to the external energy grid. The IAEA has also continued to carry out regular safeguard inspections at Ukraine’s nuclear facilities, as well as ad hoc inspections as needed – for instance, following Russian accusations of material being diverted for the production of a so-called ‘dirty bomb’.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Despite these efforts to support the safety and security of Ukrainian nuclear facilities, the Agency is ultimately limited in what it can do to resolve the challenges facing Ukrainian facilities and staff. IAEA staff on the ground in Ukraine can serve in observer and technical support roles, but do not have the capacity or mandate to address some of the most pressing challenges – including the threats that ongoing military operations pose to facilities. While ensuring the wellbeing of facility staff is a critical factor in maintaining the safety and security of facilities, the IAEA’s mandate and capabilities do not account for protecting NPP staff in a war scenario. Nevertheless, the Agency was reportedly in contact with relevant authorities following the detention of ZNPP head Ihor Murashov. The IAEA’s engagement with both Ukrainian and Russian authorities over the course of the war also means that it is in a unique position to act as an interlocutor between the two sides on issues of nuclear safety and security, at a time when no other lines of communication exist between the two countries on the subject.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;future-risks-for-ukraines-npps-during-the-conflict&quot;&gt;Future Risks for Ukraine’s NPPs During the Conflict&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although what has already transpired in Ukraine is deeply concerning, there are a range of risks that could grow over time and need to be mitigated. Russia continues to try to destroy Ukraine’s energy infrastructure and it is highly likely that this will persist during the winter of 2023–24, assuming the conflict protracts through this period. The Russian defence industry is currently estimated to be able to construct approximately 40 cruise and ballistic missiles per month, with its limited remaining stocks allowing for larger salvos to be periodically generated. In combination with simpler systems such as Shahed-136 loitering munitions, it is reasonable to presume that Russia can continue to inflict serious damage on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure at least once per month. Despite some improvements in interception rates in late 2022, strikes in March 2023 – which resulted in the loss of external power to the ZNPP – showed that Russia was also able to adapt its tactics to achieve a large proportion of successful hits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strikes on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure primarily target transformer sub-stations and thermal power plants. Although these do not directly threaten NPPs, the destabilisation of the Ukrainian energy grid poses serious problems to the safe functioning of the NPPs. Operating NPPs have been forced to deal with surges in energy that they cannot distribute, forcing emergency shutdowns. Some of the acute risks were laid out earlier; however, there are also longer-term issues. Ukrainian experts – including a former ZNPP employee – as well as the IAEA – have expressed concerns over the long-term effect on the reactors of their repeated disconnection and reconnection to the main power grid. Abrupt emergency shutdowns are now avoided through pre-emptive shutdowns based on warning, reducing the damage to infrastructure. Nevertheless, nuclear reactors are designed to be kept operating, with shutdowns being rare events. Routine reactor shutdowns will invariably lead to wear on systems and, over time, are likely to increase the risk of irregularities in procedures or in the functioning of the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another risk that will become acute over the longer term is Ukraine’s limited wet spent-nuclear-fuel storage capacity. The dangers of moving spent fuel from wet storage facilities at the various NPPs into dry storage at ISF-2 and the Centralised Spent Fuel Storage Facility at Chornobyl, as well as the on-site dry spent-fuel storage at the ZNPP, under war conditions mean that wet storage facilities are nearing capacity. Should capacity be reached, spent fuel will either have to be moved – at the risk of it coming under attack while in transit – or reactors will have to cease operation until wet storage capacity can be freed up. This could provide an opportune moment for Russia to manufacture a crisis. The international community should consider ways to ensure that there is an agreed mechanism to safely transport and store this fuel before time grants Russia a mechanism to weaponise the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has refrained from carrying out strikes intentionally targeting NPPs directly and there is no current indication that it intends to begin doing so. Depending on the nature of the incident, radiological release could have catastrophic effects for Ukrainian territory and communities in areas surrounding the NPPs, and it is likely that radioactive fallout would extend beyond Ukraine’s borders. In the case of attacks on the ChNPP or the ZNPP, the effects would almost certainly be felt in Russia. It is also unclear how Western states may react to a deliberate act of major nuclear sabotage by Russia in Ukraine. However, the possibility of a deliberate attack and widescale radiological release should not be ruled out entirely. Russian forces continue to be trained, and continue to hold significant amounts of reserve equipment, in Belarus. Further rounds of mobilisation could bring additional axes into play, even if only intended as a means of stretching Ukrainian defenders over a wider frontage. Russia’s SSO (special operations forces) have been observed conducting training in assaulting nuclear facilities with support from personnel recruited by the Russians who have previously worked at Ukrainian NPPs and have familiarity with the safety procedures. Russian authorities have also repeatedly messaged about the risks of false-flag attacks and a dirty bomb. Such messaging could indicate that Moscow is leaving the option of nuclear sabotage at the ZNPP on the table. At the time of writing, the authors assess that such Russian activity does not point to an imminent plan; rather, it indicates attempts to generate options. Nevertheless, the direct threat to Ukraine’s NPPs may increase if Russia feels that it is limited in its ability to suppress Ukrainian electricity generation while these facilities continue to operate and remain connected to Ukraine’s electricity grid, considering the importance of nuclear energy to the country’s power supply. Russia may also resort to deliberate attacks on nuclear facilities to coerce Ukraine’s partners through fear of escalation without resorting to nuclear weapons. It is worth stressing that the radiological release from an attack on an NPP would not be comparable to the consequences of a nuclear weapon detonation and the two should not be conflated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key outstanding question is how Russian forces may react if the Ukrainian armed forces successfully break through Russian defensive positions in Zaporizhzhia. The risk in this scenario could emanate from a direct assault on the facility by the Ukrainian armed forces as was attempted in October, or more likely from its encirclement as the Russian occupation of the site can be rendered unsustainable without fighting for control of the NPP directly. Retreating Russian forces may seek to engineer an incident at the facility – or threaten to do so – and blame the Ukrainian armed forces. There are two reasons why such an act may be considered. First, it could have the tactical effect of slowing down or stalling any Ukrainian exploitation of a breakthrough, requiring the Ukrainian armed forces to manage the consequences of the radiological incident instead. Second, Moscow may judge that the fear of a radiological incident among the international community could lead to a push by Western allies for Ukraine to accept a ceasefire, or desist from advancing on the Zaporizhzhia axis, at the risk of losing international support. The Ukrainian experts and officials the authors consulted in March 2023 consistently assessed that Russia is using its occupation of the ZNPP as blackmail (shantazh) to advance its military objectives in Ukraine. In reality, the West is unlikely to undertake such bargaining; however, there is a tendency towards optimism bias within Russian decision-making. The question is whether Russia convinces itself that it stands to benefit from causing a radiological incident at a Ukrainian NPP. The risk to the lives of its own personnel or Ukrainian civilians is unlikely to deter it from such a course of action. Although there is no evidence that a decision has been made in Moscow to carry out direct nuclear sabotage, variations of this kind of behaviour are widely discussed among Russian officials, including those in senior positions relating to the conduct of Russia’s occupation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may be tempting to look at the various threats to nuclear safety and security that Russia has created in Ukraine as a technical issue which can be mitigated by the deployment of additional safety equipment or over which Russia may be willing to negotiate for short-term improvements of the situation. In reality, Ukraine’s nuclear infrastructure continues to be held at risk by an actor that has already shown a limited regard for nuclear safety and security, with its behaviour only seriously constrained by the perceived practical risks as compared with the anticipated reward. In this context, mechanisms for improving behaviour move into the realm of deterrence or the infliction of consequences for violations of international standards and law which are able to shape behaviour. This requires a more proactive approach beyond the capabilities and capacity of international organisations such as the IAEA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;perspectives-on-npp-safety-in-conflict&quot;&gt;Perspectives on NPP Safety in Conflict&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having considered the risks to NPPs in Ukraine, it is important to examine the state of nuclear safety in conflict more broadly. This chapter, therefore, covers two issues. First, it examines the history of NPPs in conflict and the established requirements for ensuring their safety in this context. Second, it examines NPPs from a military viewpoint and outlines the effects a military may plan to deliver against NPPs. This chapter examines effects that are consistent with international law as well as those that are not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;broader-context-for-the-safety-of-npps-in-conflict&quot;&gt;Broader Context for the Safety of NPPs in Conflict&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current situation in Ukraine is the first time that operational NPPs have come under direct fire or been occupied by an invading military force. However, it is not the first time that civilian nuclear infrastructure has been caught in the crosshairs of a military conflict. During the Iran–Iraq War in the 1980s, the Bushehr NPP in Iran was shelled by Iraqi forces, although the facility had not yet been loaded with nuclear fuel. Reactors in Iraq and Syria have also been destroyed in military strikes; both were struck before they could become operational. More relevant to the current situation in Ukraine is the 1991 experience of the Krško NPP in Slovenia, which found itself in the proximity of military clashes following Slovenia’s declaration of independence from Yugoslavia – although, unlike in the case of the Ukrainian NPPs, the facility was never directly attacked or occupied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of today’s operating NPPs are in areas that are prone to conventional military conflict, raising questions over the risks that these facilities may face in the future. This may include the Bushehr NPP in Iran and the UAE’s Barakah NPP in the case of a military conflict in the Gulf. An escalation of tensions between India and Pakistan, or between Armenia and Azerbaijan in Nagorno-Karabakh, may put South Asian and Armenian NPPs at risk, respectively. The resumption of North Korean missile tests in 2022 and 2023 is also a timely reminder of the potential for strikes on NPPs and supporting critical infrastructure in East Asia, including operational reactors in Japan and South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the international community becomes increasingly conscious of the need to move to sustainable energy sources and aims to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, nuclear power’s global role – and, consequently, the number of NPPs and small modular reactors (SMRs) – is likely to grow. In its 2022 projections for nuclear electricity generation, the IAEA estimated that nuclear generating capacity may reach 873 GW(e) by 2050 – more than double current levels – in a high-case scenario. In a low-case scenario, nuclear power generation capacity remains at about current levels. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has also noted the important role that nuclear power is likely to have in a global transition to zero-carbon emissions by 2050; the IEA’s Net Zero Emissions Scenario suggests a doubling of global nuclear power generation capacity from 2022 to 2050. According to the World Nuclear Association, 60 additional nuclear reactors were under construction worldwide as of March 2023. The US, Russian and Chinese militaries have also expressed an interest in the use of SMRs for military purposes, which could see the deployment of these smaller, easier-to-build reactors to forward operating bases in support of military operations. Understanding the risks to nuclear energy infrastructure from military conflict – including why and how military forces may target or occupy nuclear power units – and identifying how these risks can be prevented and mitigated must be a key component of global efforts to strengthen nuclear safety and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these trends, there are no extant international regulations for operating NPPs in a conflict context. As per IAEA standards on the physical protection of nuclear materials and facilities (INFCIRC/225/Revision 5), procedures for the physical protection of Ukraine’s NPPs would have been developed based on a threat assessment and the articulation of a DBT. A DBT is meant to inform nuclear security efforts by considering the threats of ‘unauthorized removal of nuclear and other radioactive material or sabotage’ by insider and external actors. Physical protection measures should then be developed based on that assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;INFCIRC/255/Revision 5, which sets out recommendations for DBTs and other measures for the physical protection of nuclear facilities and material, is limited in the scope of risks it addresses and does not account for threats posed to nuclear safety and security in the context of a military conflict. The documents limit their recommendations to the assessment of the risks of unauthorised removal of nuclear or radiological material with the intent to construct a nuclear explosive device or which could lead to subsequent dispersal of the material, as well as risk of sabotage. Some of these risks are likely to be relevant in a military-conflict scenario; for instance, Section 5 of INFCIRC/255/Revision 5 refers to ‘stand-off attacks’ as a type of sabotage: defined as ‘An attack, executed at a distance from the target nuclear facility or transport, which does not require adversary hands-on access to the target, or require the adversary to overcome the physical protection system’. However, the document does not account for the kind of sustained military activity and occupation of facilities by invading military forces that Ukrainian NPPs currently face. Nuclear facility operators cannot reasonably be expected to respond to threats to nuclear facilities outside of what is articulated in the DBT; anything outside of it – including military attack – is the responsibility of state authorities as part of broader national security and defence planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material (and its Amendment) (CPPNM) and the International Convention on the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism (ICSANT) – Ukraine is a signatory to both – also include provisions addressing sabotage of nuclear facilities, similar to the threats Ukrainian NPPs currently face. Notably, Russia proposed the draft ICSANT to the UN General Assembly in 1996, arguing that the earlier CPPNM did not go far enough in countering the danger of nuclear terrorism. However, both the CPPNM and the ICSANT explicitly state that the conventions do not cover the activities of armed forces during an armed conflict or military exercise. Contained in an extensive series of publications, IAEA standards on nuclear safety and security set out other guidance and expectations for governments on the protection – as well as the safe design, operation and handling – of nuclear and radioactive materials and relevant facilities. Some of these are likely to be helpful in preventing and addressing certain threats to nuclear safety and security that countries may encounter in a military conflict. Yet, none have been designed for express application in a military conflict scenario or to respond to the full range of threats and challenges that emerge in such a scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;npps-in-military-planning&quot;&gt;NPPs in Military Planning&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any attempt to shape the approach militaries take towards NPPs must consider how NPPs are likely to be approached in military planning. First, there is the existing legal framework governing how militaries should operate in relation to NPPs. Second, there is the matter of how militaries are likely to operate within this framework to pursue advantage. Third, there is the question of militaries that disregard existing IHL provisions to pursue military advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A range of provisions within the laws of armed conflict (LOAC) and IHL protects NPPs from being military targets. Article 56 of the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions Protocol I prohibits attacks against ‘works and installations containing dangerous forces’, including NPPs. However, an exception to the provision lifts this protection if the NPP ‘provides electric power in regular, significant and direct support of military operations and if such attack is the only feasible way to terminate such support’, as well as for military objectives in its vicinity ‘if they are used in regular, significant and direct support of military operations and if such attack is the only feasible way to terminate such support’. At the same time, Article 56 maintains that ‘the civilian population and individual civilians shall remain entitled to all the protection accorded them by international law’, which may be inconsistent with the earlier exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Article 15 of Protocol II also prohibits attacks on NPPs ‘even where these objects are military objectives, if such attack may cause the release of dangerous forces and consequent severe losses among the civilian population’, with no exceptions. However, the 1987 explanatory note to the article highlights the provision’s focus on expected civilian losses, noting that ‘objects are not protected in themselves, but only to the extent that their destruction would release forces dangerous for the civilian population’ and that ‘assuming such a work or installation were a military objective, it could be attacked as long as the civilian population were not seriously endangered thereby’. The note goes on to explain that ‘severe losses’ is a term taken from military terminology and assessments should be made in good faith. Furthermore, the provisions in the Additional Protocols refer only to nuclear power generating stations and do not explicitly extend protections to other nuclear infrastructure, such as nuclear research reactors or spent-fuel storage facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the Geneva Protocols, the IAEA and UN Security Council have also condemned attacks on nuclear facilities. For instance, the 1985 IAEA General Conference passed a resolution on the ‘Protection of Nuclear Installations Devoted to Peaceful Purposes Against Armed Attack’, which noted that the General Conference ‘considers that any armed attack on and threat against nuclear facilities devoted to peaceful purposes constitutes a violation of the principles of the United Nations Charter, international law and the Statute of the Agency’. The issue of attacks on nuclear infrastructure was also addressed at the 1985 Review Conference of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), with specific reference to the threats to security and the international safeguards regime posed by the 1981 Israeli attack on the Osirak reactor in Iraq. In 2009, the IAEA General Conference pointed to its earlier resolutions addressing attacks on nuclear facilities and reiterated the importance of protecting nuclear installations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOAC concerning attack proportionality and the protection of civilians are also relevant in this instance. Protections against attacks on NPPs have been included in Rule 42 of customary IHL, which concerns itself with attacks on works and installations containing dangerous forces. As others have pointed out elsewhere, Russia has included similar prohibitions against attacks on objects containing dangerous forces in its military manuals and in its application of IHL; the latter makes specific reference to nuclear power stations but includes a caveat to their protection similar to that of the Geneva Conventions. A 1996 Russian Constitutional Court opinion also confirmed Russia’s obligation to the protection of facilities housing dangerous forces as per Protocol II of the Geneva Conventions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these provisions, there is a range of military acts that is both consistent with a state’s legal obligations and yet poses risks to NPP safety. Conventional military operations are fundamentally the use of physical force to compel an adversary to comply with the will of the party applying the military instrument. To achieve this, a military must incapacitate the target’s ability and will to resist. Almost all modern military concepts emphasise trying to simultaneously apply as much pressure on the target military and state as possible. The Chinese concept of Systems Confrontation is premised on simultaneously targeting an adversary’s combat forces, logistics, command and control, infrastructure, and other critical bottlenecks in its operations. Network Centric Warfare, which – despite being superseded as doctrine – remains embedded in the logic of NATO operations, endeavours to disrupt the enemy deep, denying command and control, then logistics, to enable the defeat of military units in detail. The application of these concepts has always produced attacks on CNI. In the context of initial break-in operations to suppress and destroy enemy air defences, for example, military necessity requires the disruption of enemy command and control, part of which is enabled by the supply of power. NATO struck power infrastructure in Serbia, for example, as part of its air campaign against the country. It is therefore almost inevitable that states will, in the opening phase of operations, attack another’s electricity grid; if that state depends heavily on NPPs, this will force it into operating from reversionary generators. It is important to distinguish this kind of attack on an energy grid – carried out in support of a specific military line of effort that is temporally confined – from the deliberate destruction of civilian energy infrastructure because of its importance for the civilian population, as Russia is carrying out in Ukraine. However, the distinction may not always be clear and the two objectives need not be mutually exclusive. Russia’s concept of Strategic Operations for the Destruction of Critically Important Targets is a more systematic approach to CNI destruction than severing access to it to enable military manoeuvre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because a state’s sovereignty requires defence of its CNI, states will seek to defend NPPs. Insofar as these forces are co-located with the facility, their being targeted will risk incidental damage to the facility and – depending on the context – militaries may judge that such attacks are both militarily necessary and proportionate in terms of the risk of a radiological incident. It is also important to note that emergent military concepts – such as the UK’s Multi-Domain Integration – explicitly emphasise the role of non-military tools as components of a national struggle and in doing so could cause the enablers for these tools to become valid targets. This harnessing of traditionally non-military tools to further military ends may reasonably justify some targets being classified as military objectives consistent with the principle of distinction that would historically have been classified as civilian objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is reasonable to assume that conflict will affect NPPs in the future and that an outright prohibition on militaries affecting NPPs would be unworkable. Nevertheless, militaries plan based on the effects they wish to deliver, and an examination of those that may lead military operations to affect NPPs is useful to determine what regulations might allow militaries to operate while maximising NPP safety. These effects include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deny energy to an opposing military.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deny energy to an adversary state.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Secure energy production.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Secure nuclear facilities from access by hostile actors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fix enemy forces around a piece of CNI.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Suppress or destroy military systems operating from the territory surrounding an NPP.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of regulating how these effects are delivered, it is important to note that the first two are best achieved by attacking the connections between an NPP and the wider grid, rather than the NPP itself. Others are in tension. For example, regulations must allow a military to maintain close enough proximity to a facility to offer it protection, while also reducing the likelihood that its presence would legitimise the site as a military target and thereby risk accidental damage to critical structures. Where a site is clearly being used for military purposes, providing energy to military systems, it forgoes protection. It is therefore important that states do not game the threat to civilians from the proximity of an NPP to protect a site that is being exploited for military purposes. Within this context, it is clear that any proposals for the establishment of a large nuclear safety and security zone around Ukraine’s NPPs, where military forces would be prohibited from operating, would be largely unworkable in the current conflict, as such a zone would prevent the effective control of the site or its being protected by defensive systems. The Energy Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences recently called for the establishment of a demilitarised zone around the ZNPP with a radius of 40 km, where only the presence of Russian military forces would be permitted; it should go without saying that such a suggestion cannot be treated seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It must also be acknowledged that some actors have little interest in complying with regulations, even if they are signatory to them. For instance, by targeting NPP-supporting infrastructure, occupying NPPs with military forces and reportedly placing military systems within reactor buildings, a case can reasonably be made that Russia is in violation of IHL provisions prohibiting the targeting of nuclear facilities. Iran, for its part, has prepared long-range strike systems as its primary means of deterrence by holding CNI across the Gulf at risk. In the context of such actors – which are willing to disregard IHL and other international standards – the question should not be how to strengthen or expand regulations and standards, but instead how to deter their targeting NPPs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several reasons why such a state may target an NPP. First, a state may threaten this as part of its deterrence posture. Second, it may aim to damage an NPP to tie down adversary resources. Third, a state may threaten an NPP because a radiological incident could deny the adversary an axis of advance. Fourth, a state might target an NPP as a means of compellence because of the fear it instils in a target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Militaries also have interests that constrain what they may be prepared to do near NPPs. First, a major incident at an NPP may create a humanitarian and ecological disaster that will require the diversion of considerable resources from a military’s main effort, and possibly more than the effect on the enemy’s forces. Second, an accident at an NPP risks creating a radiological hazard to friendly troops and slowing down operations, absorbing significant and scarce CBRN capabilities, or denying axes. Third, a destroyed or damaged NPP may prevent the facility from being used to provide power for the territory brought under control by a military after the completion of combat operations. Finally, the international backlash against a state that causes an incident at an NPP may bring about its isolation and have secondary consequences that are disproportionate to the military interests in striking or seizing the facility. Ultimately, however, constraining an unscrupulous military from targeting an NPP must be achieved through deterrence rather than regulation, although regulation can increase the difficulty and reduce the effect of any activity deliberately targeting an NPP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, therefore, there are a range of effects militaries may plan to deliver in relation to NPPs that pose challenges to their safety. Some of these effects are legitimate within the LOAC and IHL. Other actors may have incentives to disregard their legal obligations. It is therefore necessary to establish regulations for military operations affecting NPPs that allow the military to achieve its legitimate objectives while minimising the safety issues raised through its conduct. At the same time, to account for actors that may disregard regulations, deterrence strategies will need to be developed that consider the particular military objectives the attack on NPPs and supporting infrastructure is meant to achieve and which deny that objective or make it too costly to pursue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-for-improving-the-safety-and-security-of-npps-in-conflict&quot;&gt;Recommendations for Improving the Safety and Security of NPPs in Conflict&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recommendations outlined in this chapter to improve the safety and security of NPPs in conflict can be divided into three groups. First, the authors put forward immediate recommendations for improving the safety and security of nuclear facilities in Ukraine. Second, the authors outline recommendations for the alteration of NPP design, and security and safety considerations to better ensure their safety in conflict scenarios. Third, recommendations are identified for the conduct of militaries around civilian NPPs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ensuring-nuclear-safety-and-security-in-ukraine&quot;&gt;Ensuring Nuclear Safety and Security in Ukraine&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several measures of immediate importance that should be a priority for the international community in its response to the threats to nuclear safety and security in Ukraine. The authors’ recommendations, based on the analysis presented in this report, are outlined below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 1: Ensure the personal safety and welfare of staff at NPPs, including sufficient staffing levels.&lt;/strong&gt; International pressure on Russia – and Rosatom in particular – should be maintained and increased to allow workers at the ZNPP (and any facilities that may be occupied in the future) to rest and rotate frequently, and to be able to carry out their work without undue pressure. Ukrainian staff who wish to continue working at the ZNPP should not be forced to sign contracts with Rosatom; this may help reduce some of the stress that Ukrainian staff who do not wish to work for Rosatom face, and may allow the ZNPP to retain a greater number of staff to ensure its safe operation. Ukrainian authorities should take a carefully considered case-by-case approach to responding to Ukrainian ZNPP staff decisions to cooperate with occupying forces or Rosatom in the operation of the ZNPP, weighing staff obligations to ensuring the safe operation of the NPP against the normal expectations that staff should not assist Russian occupation and would be punished for doing so. The IAEA should work with Ukrainian and Russian authorities, as well as the wider international community, to assess and identify solutions to any shortage of licensed staff available to safely operate the ZNPP in its current condition. Any solutions to the staffing challenge should not involve the presence of technical staff at Ukrainian NPPs that have not been approved by Ukrainian authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 2: Ensure sufficient licensed Ukrainian staff are ready to resume operations at the ZNPP following Russian withdrawal from the facility.&lt;/strong&gt; In the event of a withdrawal of Russian military forces and other personnel from the ZNPP, Ukrainian authorities must be ready to provide the necessary staff and support to ensure the facility continues safe operation. As had been the case following Russian withdrawal from the ChNPP, looted and damaged equipment and systems will have to be reconstituted, which may require support from international partners. Ukrainian authorities should ensure that the necessary measures are in place domestically and should work with international partners to prepare for a rapid return of the ZNPP to safe operation by Ukrainian staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 3: Facilitate the safe transport of spent nuclear fuel to dry storage facilities, where appropriate.&lt;/strong&gt; Spent nuclear fuel that is ready to be moved to dry storage facilities at the ChNPP and the ZNPP should be transferred to the appropriate facility and thus make room for the storage of additional spent fuel as necessary. Spent fuel currently being stored at the wet storage facility in ChNPP should be moved to the ISF-2 dry storage facility, where it will benefit from greater physical protection, as soon as possible. Measures need to be put in place to allow these transfers to take place safely. Ukraine’s National Guard is normally responsible for the safety and security of nuclear fuel transport; under the current circumstances, escorts by international representatives – from the IAEA or other UN bodies – could be considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 4: Assess availability of highly radioactive waste storage facilities and certify additional storage if needed.&lt;/strong&gt; If necessary, risk assessments and other approval processes for the construction of additional highly radioactive waste storage facilities should be expedited by Ukrainian authorities. Necessary resources for the rapid construction of additional facilities should be made available – potentially with support from international partners. This will help ensure that highly radioactive waste resulting from any radiological incident that may occur at a Ukrainian NPP can be managed quickly. Should this additional storage prove unnecessary upon the conclusion of military hostilities in Ukraine, the facilities may be used to store radioactive waste from the ChNPP or for the normal operation of Ukrainian facilities in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 5: Provide CBRN, emergency response and other necessary equipment, training and support to the Ukrainian military, emergency services and NPP operators.&lt;/strong&gt; This includes providing support for the restoration of radiation monitoring and emergency response equipment that Russian forces looted or damaged at the ChNPP. Such support should be a priority to mitigate or minimise the impact of radiological incidents in Ukraine, should they occur. This approach may also reduce the potential tactical impact of a deliberate incident instigated by Russia and thereby make it less attractive. Such support could be provided by the IAEA (including continued support from the IEC), individual governments or multilateral organisations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 6: Provide regular updates on the supply of fuel for emergency generators at Ukrainian nuclear facilities, as well as the water levels in the Kakhovka Reservoir.&lt;/strong&gt; The IAEA has provided intermittent updates on the water levels in the Kakhovka Reservoir, which supplies water used to cool the ZNPP reactors. The IAEA should provide regular public updates on the reservoir’s water levels and other factors that may affect the supply of water to the ZNPP. Updates on Kakhovka Reservoir water levels in the Agency’s last two updates on nuclear safety and security in Ukraine (dated 13 April and 21 April) are welcome. Similarly, the supply of diesel fuel for the emergency generators at each NPP should be made public and regularly updated. IAEA staff stationed at various Ukrainian NPPs – especially the ZNPP, where Ukrainian authorities have limited situational awareness – should be permitted to ascertain and report this information. Should a change be observed in water supply or the availability of diesel fuel, the IAEA should seek to establish and report on the cause. The Agency should also publicise the consequences of key thresholds being crossed to increase the reputational harm for whoever causes such an event to occur and to prepare the ground for the international community to demand robust action be taken if critical support systems – such as water supply – are compromised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 7: Ensure the safe supply of diesel fuel, maintenance parts and services, and other materials necessary for the safe operation of Ukraine’s NPPs.&lt;/strong&gt; These supplies should be allowed to move freely and regularly into all Ukrainian facilities, to ensure that all safety systems, including emergency generators and water pumps, can continue to operate for extended periods of time as needed. The stress put on the reactors due to frequent disconnections from the power grid is likely to lead to an increased need for maintenance, which must be met. Fuel and component delivery to the ZNPP may require the establishment of a dedicated ‘green corridor’ or international escort – for instance, by the IAEA or another UN agency. As per the previous recommendation, the cause of the falling levels in the Kakhovka Reservoir must be ascertained and addressed. All options for ensuring constant water supply to the ZNPP must be considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 8: Penalise Rosatom staff operating at the ZNPP – and which had been present at the ChNPP – for participating in Russia’s occupation of Ukraine.&lt;/strong&gt; Rosatom management and staff presiding over and involved in the operation of the ZNPP – and which had been present at the ChNPP – are not licensed by Ukrainian authorities to operate these facilities and have taken over the management of an illegally occupied facility. National governments, multilateral organisations (namely, the EU) and the international community (through the IAEA and its Board of Governors) must condemn this activity in the strongest terms. Rosatom executives and any of their staff involved in the operation of Ukrainian facilities should be sanctioned by Ukraine’s partners. They should be excluded from participation in any international activities or forums that do not exclusively concern the safe and secure operation of the ZNPP with the ultimate objective of returning it to Ukrainian management and operation. Such measures will be not only punitive in nature but will also help to deter further Russian staff from accepting work at occupied Ukrainian facilities. Penalising and discouraging Russian personnel from operating occupied Ukrainian NPPs risks contradicting Recommendation 1, but the solution to insufficient staffing levels should not further reinforce Russian control of facilities. As per Recommendation 1, the IAEA should work with Ukrainian and Russian authorities, as well as the wider international community, to appropriately staff the facility with qualified Ukrainian or international staff that are not collaborating with the Russian occupation of the facility and which have been approved by Ukrainian authorities. At the same time, customers of Russian nuclear fuel, enriched uranium and other nuclear-energy-related goods and services around the world – including in the US and Western Europe – should look to diversify away from Russian supplies as soon as is practicable. This will avoid further enabling entities (namely, Rosatom) directly engaged in supporting the Russian occupation of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 9: Establish deterrence against a deliberately manufactured radiological incident by making clear to Russia that any such incident would be followed by a massive response to mitigate damage and expanded support for Ukraine’s war effort.&lt;/strong&gt; As discussed earlier, Russia may judge a radiological incident in the event of its withdrawal from the ZNPP to be an attractive option – a serious yet controllable escalation. Deterrence must therefore be established by making clear that any such incident will have consequences that are contrary to Russia’s interests. The best means of doing this would be for Ukraine’s international partners to emphasise that a major radiological incident at the ZNPP will lead to the deployment of international CBRN troops to assist Ukraine in dealing with the response – and that an attack on these troops will be considered an attack on the states that deployed them. Thus, Russia must believe that any such incident will not reduce the international community’s support for Ukraine. Instead, such an incident would be the basis for expanded support for Kyiv and the direct offer of assistance by deployed personnel from Ukraine’s partners. Given that the Russian leadership knows that it is not able to confront NATO forces, such a position should deter it from believing that Russia could control the consequences of any such action and therefore undermine any calculus that favours rewards over risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;preparatory-measures-for-ensuring-security-of-npps-in-future-conflict&quot;&gt;Preparatory Measures for Ensuring Security of NPPs in Future Conflict&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of the immediate threats to nuclear safety and security in Ukraine, national governments and the IAEA should make preparations to respond to similar threats to nuclear infrastructure arising in future conflicts elsewhere in the world. To this end, the authors recommend the following lines of effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 10: Consider, and adopt the necessary prevention and mitigation measures for, state-level military conflict and occupation of nuclear facilities by an invading force as part of national threat assessments, DBTs, and wider national defence and security planning.&lt;/strong&gt; The highly sensitive nature of nuclear safety and security threat assessments, DBTs, and broader state-wide national security and defence planning means that it is difficult to ascertain in the public domain the degree to which military conflict and occupation of nuclear facilities is already considered as part of these processes. This should be rectified in countries where such situations have not been considered; national and facility-specific threat assessments should be conducted to account for the threat of military attack and occupation to nuclear safety and security. Nuclear operators and regulators, intelligence agencies and defence departments must work closely in this process; responsibilities and lines of communication should be clearly defined. National response to military attack and occupation of nuclear facilities will almost certainly fall outside of the DBT and the mandate of nuclear operators or the bodies tasked with nuclear facilities’ safety and security in peacetime. However, DBTs should nevertheless include considerations around the threat of military attack and occupation. The resilience of nuclear energy infrastructure – including supply chains and fuel storage and transfer – should be strengthened accordingly. Nuclear regulators, facility operators and protection forces should be prepared to operate facilities safely and securely in conflict situations, with appropriate support from the armed forces. Best practices should be shared among states, while remaining conscious of the limitations that the sensitive nature of these threat assessments and planning pose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 11: Include considerations on military attack and occupation of nuclear facilities in the IAEA’s nuclear safety and security standards.&lt;/strong&gt; The IAEA should prioritise the articulation of recommendations on assessing, preventing and mitigating the threats to nuclear safety and security posed by military attack and occupation of nuclear facilities and supporting infrastructure. These recommendations should supplement IAEA guidance on the physical protection of nuclear facilities and material from theft and sabotage, as well as other IAEA guidance on nuclear safety and security. Recommendations should be as specific as possible and may include additional guidance on: improving the physical resilience of nuclear facilities and supporting infrastructure; managing frequent loss of power and emergency shutdown of facilities; the establishment of supply corridors and lines of deconfliction between the warring parties; the IAEA’s role in supporting the safety and security of facilities in wartime; and staff wellbeing and procedures for the operation of facilities with limited staff. It may also be necessary to modify existing practices. For example, the regulations for ensuring the safety of a site during an earthquake may involve the use of sensors and autonomous systems that military activity could trigger inappropriately – and these systems may require reversionary modes or overrides. Another critical area for regulation should be the management of systems data at a site when this may be of intelligence value to the warring parties but also important for the site’s safe operation. The IAEA’s experience in supporting nuclear safety and security in Ukraine since the full-scale invasion – including the deployment of its Support and Assistance Missions, as well as the articulation of the Seven Pillars of nuclear safety and security and related recommendations – can inform future guidance and standards. The experience of Ukrainian authorities, experts, military personnel and NPP operators should also be leveraged to inform these efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 12: Harden physical protections in the design of new NPPs. It is important to note that no amount of air and missile defence can assure an NPP from deliberate direct strike.&lt;/strong&gt; Site hardening, however, can significantly reduce the threat from such strikes. At present, the containment facilities for reactors and dry spent-fuel storage are likely sufficient to protect sites from most conventional munitions classes, except for those deliberately designed to penetrate concrete structures. States investing in hypersonic glide vehicles may expand the range of munitions and the number of vectors from which direct strikes threaten the integrity of containment. Nevertheless, prioritising innovation in the design and construction of smaller reactors that may be easier to protect, the development and deployment of more accident-tolerant reactor fuel, and subterranean structures could improve the resilience of these sites. The building up of earth around the perimeter of reactor units and other sensitive facilities may be a more realistic and economically viable solution in the short-to-medium term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equally important is the resilience of safety and emergency response systems, such as back-up generators (and their fuel supply) and mobile pumps, the lines connecting the generators to the reactor units, the piping to the water source for the site, as well as radiation monitoring and emergency response systems. These could all be struck or otherwise disconnected in a conflict scenario; burial of this equipment where possible may be an effective means of significantly increasing its survivability. Because ventilation points become key points of vulnerability to military strikes for any significantly hardened or subterranean structure, ensuring that they do not pose a threat would be a key challenge to address ahead of future NPP design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 13: Harden existing NPPs.&lt;/strong&gt; Hardening existing structures against deliberate strike can be extremely difficult and resource intensive; but some modifications can likely be made to better protect sites from incidental strike. This would include hardening plant support systems such as generators and back-up fuel storage. Other measures that would significantly improve the resilience of these sites is the clearing of a surrounding area from fire risk and the construction of a glacis around the perimeter to shield the site from direct fire. Such a glacis would significantly reduce the risk of rounds from units in contact – especially kinetic penetrators and ATGMS that could pose a penetration risk to critical NPP facilities – from overflying targets in combat and striking the facility. This would not remove the threat from indirect fire, but the hardening of key support machinery and removal of flammable materials should reduce the risk from anything but deliberate strikes. Hardening water pipes from the facility so that they are dug into the earth and are not at risk of being ruptured by the passage of heavy armoured vehicles over them is also advisable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;measures-for-minimising-risk-to-npps-during-military-operations&quot;&gt;Measures for Minimising Risk to NPPs During Military Operations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although states can modify or design NPPs to reduce the risks to the facility in conflict, it is also necessary for militaries to agree on rules for operating around and fighting over NPPs that account for the safety of these sites. The following recommendations are intended to significantly improve the safety of NPPs without undermining the logic of military operations or allowing the rules to be gamed in such a way as to encourage agreement violations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 14: Establish a 1-km demilitarised zone around NPPs.&lt;/strong&gt; The notion of a demilitarised zone around NPPs has merit as a means of distinguishing military targets from civilian objects. As such, it would be sensible for the IAEA to reprise efforts to establish a nuclear safety and security zone around the ZNPP. Serious consideration must be given to what such a zone may look like in practice in this particular instance – and what principles can be applied for establishing such zones around NPPs in future conflicts. A large demilitarised zone is likely impractical. To use a nominal example of 10 km, this would mean that a hypothetical NPP near Narva would prevent military manoeuvre across one third of Estonia’s border with Russia. It is unlikely that either Russia or NATO would accept such a canalisation of its battlespace in conflict. A smaller demilitarised zone, however, would be sufficient to reduce the likelihood of accidental strikes on the station and is more promising. Given that the least accurate artillery classes tend to have a circular error probable at maximum range of less than 300 metres, even accounting for a major error of judgement by fire controllers, a 1-km demilitarised zone seems both sufficient and viable. This would also create a standard for the distance from the site of the glacis proposed earlier. The establishment of such a demilitarised zone also requires that no military equipment – including defensive systems – be stationed at the NPP or in the demilitarised area around it. By agreeing that military units defending a site should not come within this zone, it would be possible for a military to screen and defend the site, cover it with air defence, and perform other functions, without locating military units sufficiently close to draw fire that could put the NPP at risk. This would also enable an attack to engage defenders and to contest control of the points of ingress and egress – thereby contesting control of the site – without needing to put manoeuvre forces on to the facility. Responsibility for site safety internally would thus need to be agreed to be civilian or paramilitary, with an agreement that agencies should not carry weapon classes other than small arms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a demilitarised zone would also remove ambiguity around the conditions granted to NPPs under the Geneva Conventions and other international law – namely, that such facilities are not to be attacked unless they are providing significant military support which cannot feasibly be terminated other than by military attack. If a party were to breach the demilitarised zone, then it ought to be understood that the protections of the site revert to judgements of proportionality and military necessity and that the side violating the demilitarised zone ought to bear a defined – albeit proportionate – culpability for the consequences of the site’s militarisation. These rules should only apply to civilian NPPs and are clearly not relevant to military capabilities that depend on nuclear power or reactors being used to provide energy for military systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 15: Grant special protected status to critical NPP safety, security and emergency response systems.&lt;/strong&gt; If a force can isolate and therefore exert control over a civilian NPP, some reasonable expectations should be agreed on. First, no action by the controlling administration should damage or risk the functioning of systems that are critical to the safe and secure operation of NPPs, as well as to emergency response – including radiation monitoring. There should also be an agreed mechanism for the protection of declared convoys moving civilian staff certified to operate NPPs, fuel for reversionary generators and other critical spare parts to the facility. All parties should also add the demarcation of vents and water intakes and outlets for the site to no-strike lists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 16: Define an obligation for the establishment of deconfliction lines by militaries operating around NPPs, as well as the nuclear regulators or other responsible authorities in the concerned states.&lt;/strong&gt; Ensuring that these measures are observed requires an ability to deconflict between the warring parties. To this end, parties should be required to establish a deconfliction line between the respective commands responsible for the area of operations containing an NPP, as well as the nuclear regulators, operators or other relevant authorities in the relevant states. In the event of a radiological accident or other safety and security incident at the site, failure to crew the deconfliction line should confer liability on a command. Obligations should also be established for a force to cooperate in protecting civilian traffic intended to assist in dealing with an identified safety incident. This deconfliction mechanism should also allow access and regular rotation of IAEA staff to the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 17: Establish regulations relating to effects of cyber and electromagnetic activities applied in the vicinity of NPPs.&lt;/strong&gt; As regards military effects targeting NPPs, capabilities such as electronic warfare effects, and especially cyber attacks, could impact the functioning of an NPP. In the case of electronic warfare, the disruption of critical sensors, precision timing and other functions could lead to protocols being initiated in autonomous control systems that are highly suboptimal. In the case of cyber attacks, these could damage control systems for the NPP. The air-gapping of NPP systems is an impediment, but not an impenetrable barrier, to military cyber capabilities. It would therefore be sensible to standardise the frequencies and functioning of sensors used at NPPs. Technical specifications should be made available to governments – though not necessarily the public – and regulations constraining the use of electronic warfare effects against NPPs should be articulated. Cyber effects are different from electronic warfare effects because they are bespoke, especially against an air-gapped system. Here, it should be agreed that cyber attacks that are liable to cause the malfunction of safety systems, or enact protocols that threaten plant safety, should be considered a breach of international law when used against a civilian NPP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The threats to nuclear safety and security in Ukraine resulting from Russia’s invasion pose a range of acute and chronic risks. The likelihood of a Chornobyl-like catastrophe is limited unless Ukraine’s NPPs are targeted deliberately. However, the potential for a Fukushima-like radiological incident, or the spread of radioactive particles resulting from a strike on a radioactive waste storage facility, while still not highly likely, cannot be discounted. It is important that the international community works to support Ukraine in mitigating the impact of such a scenario, endeavours to deter Russia from further endangering NPPs, and is proactive in addressing the chronic challenges before they become acute. Russia’s disregard for its own commitments to the protection of nuclear facilities should also be punished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Russia’s actions in its disregard for nuclear safety and security and the IHL protections granted to nuclear facilities are egregious, it should also be recognised that threats to nuclear safety and security in conflict zones will arise even if combatants adhere to the LOAC and IHL. Attacks on CNI – including energy generation – are part of most states’ military doctrines and there are legitimate military objectives to be achieved in seizing control of civilian NPPs. For example, severing power supplies as part of an initial suppression and destruction of enemy air defences would be consistent with international law but could pose secondary challenges to NPPs which would be thrown into emergency shutdown. As more states turn to nuclear power to deal with the threat from climate change, it is likely that NPPs will become more prevalent in conflict zones, and that controlling them will become a key military objective. Even though gaining control of an NPP does not necessarily require assaulting the structure, fighting in the vicinity of NPPs carries considerable risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has demonstrated some significant deficiencies in the international regulation of NPPs and gaps in safety and security standards. As the challenges presented in Ukraine are likely to be repeated in the future, the international community must use the lessons from the conflict to update the design, operation and oversight of NPPs to improve their safety and security. It is also worthwhile for militaries to consider what measures they can implement to reduce the risk of accidental damage to NPPs while enabling them to conduct legitimate military tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report has made a range of recommendations. Any proposals that rely on the outright prohibition of military action targeting NPPs are unlikely to be effective or to withstand the test of time. Instead, understanding why and how NPPs are likely to factor into military planning, including the types of attacks that may be directed at them, will help determine how best to prepare for their defence and potential occupation. Preparations can be made at the point of NPP design and construction in the first instance, to ensure physical resilience of key structures and support systems. Measures taken during a conflict – such as the establishment of deconfliction lines or a 1-km demilitarised zone around NPPs – can help to further reduce the likelihood of radiological accidents. Cooperation between industry, national nuclear regulators and ministries of defence, as well as leadership by the IAEA and individual countries or groups of states, will be key in further articulating the necessary measures and standards to support nuclear safety and security in future military conflicts and ensuring their effective implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ZMnOETB.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（26日）踏入審訊第51天。控方昨表示上周六（22日）始破解第三名控方證人鍾錦麟的電話，辯方需時審視昨午才收到的逾2,400則訊息，押至今天處理。辯方今表示仍需時審視，望於下周才傳召鍾錦麟，法官陳慶偉押至下周四（5月4日）續審，又向控方指「不希望再有任何意外和延遲」。法官李運騰關注審訊進度，提及他於9月底有案件要處理，又指除不認罪的16名被告，亦需時處理其餘31人的求情判刑。翻查資料，黎智英及《蘋果日報》3間公司涉勾結外國勢力案定於9月底開審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方需時審視新訊息-鍾錦麟押至下周四作供-官不希望再有任何任何意外和延遲&quot;&gt;辯方需時審視新訊息 鍾錦麟押至下周四作供 官：不希望再有任何任何意外和延遲&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方昨表示，於上周六（22日）始破解鍾錦麟電話，並於昨午向辯方提供逾2,400則訊息。控方稱不會依賴新資料，辯方則指需時審視，押後至今天處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表黃碧雲和林卓廷的大律師沈士文今表示，團隊仍在審視新的WhatsApp訊息和附件，亦需向當事人索取指示，建議鍾錦麟的主問押後至本周五開始，並望能於當天完結，可於下周四開始盤問，並指大部分辯方律師均同意。法官早前宣布，明天（27日）、下周二及周三（5月2日及3日）均不開庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/nEjEVLt.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 則表示，雖然他有助手能讀中文，但他不能，故其進度較慢，希望下周才傳召鍾錦麟。坐在 Beel 身旁的大律師黃廷光沒有配戴假髮，法官陳慶偉一度着 Beel：「叫你的鄰座戴上他的假髮」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉遂指，不認為有太大分別，或可於下星期開始，期間各方也可索取指示，又向控方指：「我不希望再有任何意外和延遲。（I hope there won’t be any more surprise and delay.）」，多名被告發笑。主控萬德豪表示，應不會再有類似的披露情況。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，代表陳志全的大律師馬維騉表示，他此前曾代表鍾錦麟作保釋申請。法官李運騰問是在另一宗案件？馬指是這宗案件，但是在最早的保釋申請階段，而其後的發展與他無關。他又指，控方和辯方均知悉此情況，沒有人反對。陳慶偉表示明白，會再考慮。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官關注審訊進度-指需處理31人求情&quot;&gt;官關注審訊進度 指需處理31人求情&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰其後表示，由於趙家賢已完成作供，相信之後的證人需時較短，問審訊是否仍預計需時90日？萬德豪指，視乎可同意多少事實，仍與辯方商討。李運騰指越快越好，因他在9月底有很重大的案件要處理（very substantive engagement），又指考慮到法官的數量，更換法官並不可行。李又指，大律師關文渭也有參與該案，關則指主控周天行亦有參與該案。翻查資料，壹傳媒創辦人黎智英與《蘋果日報》3間公司被控「串謀勾結外國勢力」等罪，原定今年9月25日開審，李運騰為該案主審法官之一，本案主控周天行亦為該案主控。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪表示，預計本周能給予答覆。李運騰再指，除了不認罪的16名被告，尚要處理其餘31名被告的判刑，假設每天可聽取兩人求情，31人也需要兩星期，還未計可能要爭拗案情撮要。萬德豪指會盡力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大律師黃宇逸最後表示，希望控方能提供將會傳召的證人名單，法官着他直接問控方。聆訊不足10分鐘完結。&lt;/p&gt;

It provides an overview of the priorities of five countries (the UK, the US, Canada, Japan, and Singapore) and the EU. The focus rests on cyber policy advanced in the period from January 2019 to March 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research underlying this paper focuses on four key research areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The general context in which cyber policy is made.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Priorities with regard to the protection of critical national infrastructure (CNI).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Approaches to the development of cyber skills and the cyber workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;International cooperation on norm development for cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-context&quot;&gt;The Context&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All jurisdictions follow a unique cyber strategy, but common approaches exist:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strategies are updated in line with domestic timelines but also adjust to changes in the cyber threat landscape (such as the rise of cybercrime) and respond to geopolitical events and the increased need to secure CNI and supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strategies increasingly focus on harmonising and streamlining each jurisdiction’s cyber policies to avoid fragmentation and duplication of efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is an increasing reliance on interventionist policies and regulations to enhance resilience and cyber-security standards.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;on-critical-national-infrastructure&quot;&gt;On Critical National Infrastructure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ensuring greater protection of critical national infrastructure (CNI) is a priority for all jurisdictions examined. This is often done by updating or increasing existing cyber-security obligations, or expanding them beyond CNI sectors to further support the resilience of supply chains. International businesses and cyber-security professionals must simultaneously comply with changing (and at times varying) obligations among different jurisdictions. Further research comparing the differing scopes of CNI designations and their respective cyber-security obligations is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;on-the-cyber-workforce&quot;&gt;On the Cyber Workforce&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The global cyber-security workforce shortage and the need for further skills development is seen in all jurisdictions examined. A wide range of initiatives, many of which resemble each other, are advanced by the respective jurisdictions to attract talent, diversify the workforce and increasingly harmonise existing efforts. For example, several jurisdictions have adopted skills frameworks, such as the US’s National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Cybersecurity Workforce Framework or the European Cybersecurity Skills Framework (ECSF), to harmonise language used to describe cyber-security roles. Little is known about the effectiveness of these initiatives in markedly reducing the cyber-security workforce gap in a quantifiable way. More research is needed to understand which initiatives help reduce the gap in the cyber-security workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;on-international-cooperation-on-cyber-norm-development&quot;&gt;On International Cooperation on Cyber-Norm Development&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All jurisdictions examined actively cooperate on cyber-norm development and seek to advance a free and secure cyberspace. They do so by supporting UN processes for norm development, by engaging in a range of multilateral, bilateral and multi-stakeholder arrangements, and by seeking greater cooperation on cyber (including on the development of cyber-security skills and closing the gap in the cyber workforce). More cooperation on skills development could further boost understanding of how to develop global solutions to a global problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technological innovation and advancement continue to disrupt society at pace. While the economic benefits of breakthrough technologies are fairly clear, there are new cyber risks to infrastructure and data to consider. In light of these dynamics, countries are constantly designing, monitoring and refreshing their cyber -security policies, legislation and regulation to protect national security and the economic security and safety of organisations and their citizens. While some of the trends in cyber security are global, each jurisdiction’s approach to cyber policy and associated legislation and regulation follows its own themes and priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the content of cyber policies naturally varies, so do the mechanisms to implement them. Jurisdictions may prefer different types of levers to implement their cyber policies. Whereas one country may prefer to legislate heavily, others may advance cyber policies through standard-setting or non-binding policies. The approach a country chooses is shaped by a multitude of complex factors, including its political standpoint, constitutional structures, the cyber-threat landscape, the role of the private sector, and other socio-legal and historical factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding national and regional approaches to cyber policy is crucial, as these directly impact individuals and organisations operating within the respective jurisdictions. This paper allows policymakers and businesses to understand regulatory trends in several jurisdictions, providing them with up-to-date insights on how the regulatory landscape in these jurisdictions is evolving – and what that means for businesses and individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guide sets out to compare the approaches of six different jurisdictions – the UK, the EU, the US, Canada, Japan and Singapore – with regard to their respective cyber-policy agendas. The aim here is to improve understanding of the impact these policy agendas have on businesses and individuals working in these jurisdictions. This paper provides a valuable overview of different approaches to cyber policy by identifying trends in key legislative and regulatory initiatives over the past four years. A comparative section at the end of the paper puts these initial findings into perspective and identifies areas for future research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;research-questions&quot;&gt;Research Questions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper aims to provide an overview of different approaches to cyber-security policy. To narrow down the wide research area of cyber-security policy, the research underlying the paper focuses on four key research questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is the general background that shapes each jurisdiction’s approach to cyber policy?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What are the national priorities for developing cyber-resilience measures for critical national infrastructure (CNI)?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How do the jurisdictions advance skills development and/or workforce regulation in the cyber context?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How do these jurisdictions approach international cooperation on cyber regulation and how do they engage with other countries and entities, for example, in the context of norm-developing frameworks?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology-and-scope&quot;&gt;Methodology and Scope&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research underlying this publication was primarily based on a review of existing literature. This involved the creation of search strings that were inputted into online repositories to identify sources. Google Scholar was the primary search engine used to find academic articles. Grey literature, including policy papers, was sourced through Bing and Google Search. From these initial sources, the research team identified further literature by examining article bibliographies and other references. Alongside these secondary sources, primary sources such as legislation, regulations and other official documents and government papers were also considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research was conducted from December 2022 to March 2023. Analysis of the gathered sourced material was based on a thematic approach, assessing sources’ provenance, arguments and conclusions in order to identify different approaches to cyber regulation in the EU and the five countries examined. The six jurisdictions studied – the UK, the EU, the US, Canada, Japan and Singapore – were chosen because they drive policymaking in cyber security and are leaders in the field, either as norm developers or because of their technology sectors. The research focused primarily on policies enacted or proposed between 2019 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout this paper, the term ‘policy’ is used in a broad sense and encompasses binding (‘hard law’) as well as non-binding (‘soft law’) instruments or other policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;limitations&quot;&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper aims to provide policymakers with a guide on trends in recent cyber-security policy in various jurisdictions. It is therefore limited in scope and depth and serves as a starting point for future research. This means that reference can only be made to a selection of policies, regulations, or legislative activities, rather than listing them all. Nevertheless, the paper informs the reader about key issues and trends in the field, while keeping the level of detail appropriate for an initial overview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;structure&quot;&gt;Structure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper comprises six chapters, each dedicated to the approach to cyber-security regulation taken by one of the jurisdictions. Each chapter begins by setting out the jurisdiction’s approach to cyber policy, regulation and legislation, structured around the four research questions listed above. After setting out the general context in which the approach to cyber-security policy must be seen, each chapter goes on to identify how the jurisdiction advances cyber-resilience measures for CNI. Then, each chapter examines how the jurisdiction approaches skills development and workforce regulation, before analysing the approach to international cooperation on cyber-norm development. After the individual chapters, the paper offers some general concluding remarks that make initial comparative observations based on the jurisdiction-level analysis, and points out further areas of research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-uk&quot;&gt;The UK&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;context&quot;&gt;Context&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK is ‘a highly capable cyber state’ that follows an ambitious approach to cyber policy. This is reflected in its 2022 National Cyber Strategy, which advances a ‘whole of society approach’. Although largely in line with its 2016 Strategy, which shifted UK cyber policy toward binding regulation, the UK’s new strategy stresses a greater need for a holistic approach to cyber policy, as cyber issues relate to all areas of modern life. The ‘whole of society’ approach, as advanced in the UK cyber strategy, includes public–private partnerships and civil society, but also aspects such as ‘education strategy, industrial policy, work on regulations and incentives, and foreign policy’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new holistic approach also confirms the UK’s commitment to being a ‘cyber power’, a term used throughout the strategy, solidifying the UK’s strategic approach to cyberspace. It refers to the UK’s position advanced in the 2021 Integrated Review, which stresses the importance of responsible and democratic cyber power to achieving the UK’s national goals. On the whole, the UK’s strategy follows a ‘strategic and wide-ranging approach to cyber’. Next to the national cyber strategy, the UK also has a Government Cyber Security Strategy (2022–30) and a cyber-resilience strategy for the UK National Health Service (NHS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK’s strong position in the cyber field is supported by a wide range of public authorities working on cyber matters. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) stands out for conducting central – primarily technical – work on UK cyber security since its establishment in 2016, analysing and researching key cyber threats and risks. In 2020, the UK also confirmed the existence of its National Cyber Force, a unique body dedicated to offensive cyber operations. This agency sits between the intelligence agency GCHQ and the Ministry of Defence and ‘covers the full range of the UK’s national-security priorities’, including serious crime, terrorism and state threats. In 2023, the Department of Science, Innovation and Technology was formed, taking over tasks on cyber policy previously undertaken by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS). Of primary relevance for the UK workforce is the UK Cyber Security Council, a self-regulatory body developing and promoting professional standards for the cyber workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wide range of threats facing the UK was underlined in the NCSC’s 2022 Annual Review. These include ransomware attacks and other types of cybercrime, threats posed by state actors in cyberspace, and commercially available cyber tools. The UK also faces a significant gap in the cyber-security workforce, which increased further in 2022. The UK cyber strategy recognises this gap and signals an intention to expand the UK’s cyber skills and train, attract and diversify a growing cyber-security workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;priorities-for-national-cyber-resilience-measures-for-cni&quot;&gt;Priorities for National Cyber-Resilience Measures for CNI&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the priorities set out in the UK National Cyber Strategy is increasing the UK’s resilience. Confirming its whole-of-society approach, efforts to increase cyber resilience include (but are not limited to) improving the resilience of CNI. The UK government currently identifies 13 sectors as CNI, including civil nuclear, chemicals, food and health – education is not among the sectors listed. Given that a large percentage of UK CNI is owned by the private sector, close cooperation between the public and private sectors is required. The NCSC fosters such cooperation and provides a number of tools for guidance and advice for CNI businesses. It has also set up the ‘Industry 100’ initiative for further cooperation with industry partners. Furthermore, the 2023 Refresh of the UK’s Integrated Review announced a National Protective Security Authority, which ‘will engage with businesses and institutions to protect [the UK’s] security and prosperity at home’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the regulatory side, the UK has confirmed it will update its 2018 Security of Network &amp;amp; Information Systems Regulations (NIS Regulations). Results of the consultation process on the proposal for the updated NIS Regulations were published in November 2022, stating that the government aims to update this legislation ‘as soon as parliamentary time allows’. Given the updated EU regulations on NIS, such an update comes as no surprise, but could potentially mark one of the first areas of divergence post-Brexit. Businesses and their cyber-security staff operating in the EU and the UK which fall under the scope of both regulations will have to comply with two changing – but not necessarily identical – sets of requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the UK’s priorities for the updated NIS Regulations is to broaden the scope of their application, to include more businesses that will have to comply with the respective binding obligations, technology providers in particular. The regulations’ two-tier system, which imposes stricter requirements on essential service providers than on digital service providers, will remain. However, and arguably ‘long overlooked by the UK’s NIS Regulations’, managed service providers will be added as a new category of digital service providers that must comply with the regulations’ requirements. Although software companies are unlikely to be included, the illustrative list published by DCMS names IT outsourcing services, application management services, managed security operations centres and incident response services as managed IT services that will fall within the new scope of the NIS Regulations. As a result, these entities’ cyber workforces must comply with the new cyber-security obligations in the updated NIS Regulations. Furthermore, the updated regulations aim to improve the reporting of cyber incidents to regulators, likely expanding mandatory reporting to incidents ‘even if they don’t immediately cause disruption’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond CNI – and mirroring the EU’s proposal for a Cyber Resilience Act – the UK also passed the Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure Act in December 2022. This entails obligations for companies that manufacture, import or distribute smart consumer products, further enhancing cyber resilience in the UK; however, these obligations have not yet come into force, as they require additional regulation. Such obligations may build upon the Code of Practice for Consumer IoT Security that the DCMS and NCSC developed in 2018. In addition, the UK government is advancing a Data Protection and Digital Information Bill, seeking to update the data protection laws previously based on the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, and to reduce paperwork for businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;workforce-and-skills-development-and-regulation&quot;&gt;Workforce and Skills Development and Regulation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to implement the regulatory updates outlined above and to enhance cyber resilience, the UK’s National Cyber Strategy recognises a need for developing a more ‘diverse and technically skilled workforce’. Improving diversity, in this context, goes beyond targeting the gender imbalance in the field, but also includes the need for greater regional diversity. London and the southeast of England employ nearly half of all UK cyber-security professionals. In response to this imbalance, the UK government has funded 12 ‘cyber clusters’. Located throughout all four home nations, these organisations are tasked with enhancing cooperation with the (local) private sector and civil society, but also with various public stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other government-backed initiatives for skills development include CyBOK (a programme setting up a body for collecting knowledge and making resources to develop cyber skills publicly available). Further initiatives under the NCSC’s CyberFirst programme for students include ‘Cyber Explorers’, a learning platform for young students, and the CyberFirst bursary scheme, offering undergraduate students £4,000 per year in financial assistance and cyber-security training to support their careers in cyber security. The UK Cyber Security Council has further established a cyber career framework, identifying 16 areas of specialism that provide practitioners with guidelines for career planning. In addition, the UK Cyber Security Council has taken over the (formerly NCSC-run) Certified Cyber Professional Scheme. The Council has also launched a pilot professional registration scheme for some of the 16 specialisms in cyber security at three registration titles: Associate; Principal; and Chartered. This pilot scheme will be extended to more specialisms throughout 2023. Such pilot projects can be seen as indicative of future developments in the professionalisation of the UK’s cyber workforce. This is also in line with a DCMS consultation on the professionalisation of the cyber workforce, which envisages professional standard-setting by 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the UK arguably still faces a significant shortage in the cyber-security workforce, and a cyber-security skills gap, despite the fact that the government has launched a wide variety of initiatives. A similar assessment is made in a DCMS study, ‘Cybersecurity Skills in the UK Labour Market 2022’, which found that many organisations lack skills in areas such as setting up configured firewalls or detecting and removing malware. Other skills-development paths such as apprenticeships or skills transfers in later career stages could be better utilised to try to close the gap even more. Further research is thus necessary to better understand the effectiveness of existing initiatives for skills development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;international-interaction-on-cyber-norm-development&quot;&gt;International Interaction on Cyber-Norm Development&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as advancing cyber policy on a domestic level, the UK also shapes international norm development in cyberspace. A 2022 ministerial document describes the UK as a ‘leading responsible and democratic cyber power’. The UK delivers on such ambitions by being actively involved in the UN norm-development processes, arguing in favour of norms of responsible cyber behaviour and the applicability of international law in cyberspace. The UK has also repeatedly argued in favour of a multi-stakeholder approach to cyberspace governance. Furthermore, the UK government emphasises the need for a stable, peaceful and secure cyberspace that maintains human-rights standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK’s international cooperation on cyber-norm development is primarily advanced through the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), which funds a number of initiatives for greater norm cooperation in cyberspace; this includes, for example, funding projects identifying responsible cyber behaviour. In addition, the UK actively supports and funds cyber capacity-building in cooperation with a range of jurisdictions, particularly Commonwealth countries. In 2021, an additional £22 million for cyber capacity-building in Africa and the Indo-Pacific was announced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, the UK has cooperated with its allies with respect to sanctioning cyber-criminals, as well as with attributing malicious cyber operations to state actors. Finally, the UK has concluded a large number of bilateral agreements with other jurisdictions, setting out areas of cooperation in the cyber domain, including the US, the Netherlands, Australia and Italy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-eu&quot;&gt;The EU&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;context-1&quot;&gt;Context&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU is a well-established player in the field of cyber policy and actively shapes Europe’s approach to the regulation of cyber security. Economically powerful, the EU has also proven to be highly influential on cyber-security matters, and not just when it comes to data protection. The EU implements its vision for a free and secure cyberspace through a combination of different instruments, binding regulations, standard-setting directives and influential policies (including cyber diplomacy). Whereas the EU cyber-security policy in the 2010s was still largely seen as fragmented or ‘unsystematic’, many of the more recent efforts are working towards greater horizontal integration and harmonisation among EU member states. Four key activities have stood out in the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the EU updated its cyber-security strategy in 2020 to mark the new digital decade. The updated strategy prioritises greater cyber resilience, especially for critical infrastructure, as well as increased cooperation and EU leadership on international norms and standards development. Activities in both areas are addressed in greater detail below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the role of the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, ENISA, has been strengthened by the 2019 Cybersecurity Act, giving the body a permanent mandate, as well as more tasks and resources. The EU Cybersecurity Act introduces an EU-wide cyber-security certification framework for ICT products, services and processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, the European Commission and the European External Action Service set out the EU’s new cyber defence policy in November 2022, which is ‘intended to strengthen European Cybersecurity capacity, boost military and civilian cooperation, close potential loopholes, reduce strategic dependencies and develop cyber skills’. This policy is primarily a response to deteriorating relations with Russia, and includes setting up an EU Cyber Defence Coordination Centre, as well as a network of military Computer Emergency Response Teams, an EU Cyber Commanders Conference and joint exercises. Similarly, the newly proposed Cyber Solidarity Act envisages the creation of a cyber emergency fund for incident response in the event of a large-scale cyber attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final noteworthy development is the proposal of the EU Cyber Resilience Act. The Commission’s proposal from September 2022 ‘aims to impose cybersecurity obligations on all products with digital elements whose intended and foreseeable use includes direct or indirect data connection to a device or network’. This includes cyber security by design as well as by default principles. The proposal is not yet in its final form, but is said to require businesses such as hardware manufacturers or software developers (as well as distributors and importers) to comply with ‘an “appropriate” level of cyber security, the prohibition [on selling] products with any known vulnerability, security by default configuration, protection from unauthorised access, limitation of attack surfaces, and minimisation of incident impact’. The Cyber Resilience Act is widely seen as a shift away from the EU’s sectoral approach to regulation, which imposes cyber-security regulations on specific products such as medical devices. Instead, the Cyber Resilience Act is intended to avoid both the fragmentation of market standards and duplication of obligations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;priorities-for-national-cyber-resilience-measures-for-cni-1&quot;&gt;Priorities for National Cyber-Resilience Measures for CNI&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The protection and resilience of CNI are also a growing priority for EU policymakers. In order to be prepared to respond to the landscape of heightened threats in the contemporary geopolitical context, the EU is currently seeking to update its directive on critical infrastructure (from 2008) and intends new legislation to be in force in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new legislation will be complemented by existing directives, primarily the Directive on Resilience of Critical Infrastructure and the Revised Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems (NIS 2 Directive). The former was proposed by the Commission in 2020 to strengthen the resilience of critical entities that provide essential services in case of disruption, e.g., terrorist or other attacks. Member states are required to have a strategy for such events and to ‘carry out risk assessments’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Updated in 2022, the NIS 2 Directive complements the Directive on Resilience of Critical Infrastructure by obliging the same CNI entities to follow cyber-resilience obligations. It has further expanded in scope and ‘now covers medium and large entities from more sectors that are critical for the economy and society’. The updated NIS 2 Directive imposes strengthened cyber-security requirements on companies, covers the security of supply chains and further ‘introduces accountability of top management for non-compliance with the cybersecurity obligations’ alongside stricter enforcement requirements, alignment of reporting obligations and supervisory measures for national authorities. The NIS 2 Directive came into force in January 2023, giving member states until October 2024 to incorporate the measures into national law. However, there can still be national differences in implementation, and businesses and cyber-security professionals may have to comply with varying obligations, depending on the country in which they operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The obligations set out under the NIS 2 Directive, the Cyber Resilience Act and the Cyber Security Act increase cyber-security obligations and expand their application to a growing number of sectors and organisations. These obligations underline the need for cyber-security expertise and further require that businesses comply with new policies; this is likely to increase demand for more cyber professionals and more cyber expertise in related fields, e.g., in procurement or project management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;workforce-and-skills-development-and-regulation-1&quot;&gt;Workforce and Skills Development and Regulation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To implement the increased obligations for cyber resilience set out in new and updated regulations, cyber-skills development is necessary, and the cyber workforce needs to be able to comply with these new measures. The lack of cyber-security skills in the European workforce has frequently been addressed in the literature. Not only is there a significant skills gap, which some studies find to be growing, but it is also increasingly difficult for companies to find and hire skilled cyber-security staff. Studies imply that the cyber-security labour market has been unable to match the steep rise in cybercrime and the high demand for cyber-security professionals in light of increasing digitalisation. Although skills and workforce development are dealt with by each individual member state, the EU is also responding to these issues, and has funded a wide range of initiatives in this sphere, particularly in terms of harmonising existing approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2019, the European Commission launched four projects for cyber-security research, alongside training and education programmes, but their funding is now coming to an end. They were launched in preparation for the European Cybersecurity Competence Centre (ECCC), which is currently being developed. The ECCC will be located in Bucharest and will, together with national competence centres, develop ‘a common agenda for technology development’, including in businesses, especially SMEs. Furthermore, the European Commission has plans to set up a Cybersecurity Skills Academy with a potential launch date in the third quarter of 2023. This year, 2023, is also the European Year of Skills, prompting further initiatives to address the skills shortages among the EU workforce, including in cyber security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In line with the EU’s other efforts to streamline its cyber-security policy, ENISA introduced the European Cybersecurity Skills Framework (ECSF) in September 2022. As a ‘tool to build a common understanding of the cybersecurity professional role profiles’, the ECSF sets out 12 roles and their respective skills and responsibilities, for example, those of ‘cyber incident responder’, or ‘cybersecurity educator’. However, previous studies have indicated the need for further research on what policies are most effective in supporting a robust talent pipeline for cyber-security professionals. Alongside this Framework, ENISA has also created a Cybersecurity Higher Education Database, which lists cyber-security degrees from EEA countries and Switzerland. The database is intended as a point of reference for citizens wanting to upgrade their skills through further education and training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;international-interaction-on-cyber-norm-development-1&quot;&gt;International Interaction on Cyber-Norm Development&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to its work on the close coordination of cyber policy within the EU, the EU is also active beyond the territory of its member states. The EU’s 2020 Cyber Strategy sets out to ensure an open and safe internet and for the EU to ‘step up its cooperation with partners around the world who share [its] values of democracy, rule of law and human rights’. The EU has done much to act upon these aims, with some even referring to it as a ‘norm superpower’. Indeed, the EU’s track record points towards the active role it has played in shaping the cyber-norm debate. On an international level, the EU has supported the UN processes on norm development, and also supports the proposal for a Programme of Action to Advance Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace as a permanent mechanism within the UN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the EU actively cooperates with other countries to strengthen their cyber security. This includes funding cyber-security measures in Eastern European countries such as Ukraine (e.g., to secure data exchanges or to protect critical infrastructure), as well as in Georgia. Together with the US, the EU plans to provide further cyber-capacity-building in Africa and the Indo-Pacific region. The EU has also funded EU CyberNet, a network of cyber-security experts and academics, to coordinate the EU’s external cyber-capacity-building projects (although this is coming to an end in 2023), as well as EU Cyber Direct, a think tank- and academia-led initiative in support of the EU’s cyber diplomacy, focusing on norm development and capacity-building programmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2019, the European Council launched a sanctions regime which enables the EU to respond to (and deter) cyber attacks. This sanctions regime, which enables collective action by the EU and its member states, is part of the ‘EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox’, and it has since been extended until 2025. Potential measures include asset freezing and travel restrictions. Since its first use in 2020, the sanctions regime has been used on several subsequent occasions, for example, against the hackers who targeted the German Bundestag and those behind (inter alia) WannaCry and NotPetya. However, the attribution of cyber operations remains ‘a major challenge for EU cyber sanctions’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-us&quot;&gt;The US&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;context-2&quot;&gt;Context&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US has a strong record of advancing cyber-security policies that support an open, stable and secure cyberspace, and the country’s large private sector makes it a particularly powerful actor in the field. In March 2023, the Biden administration published a new National Cybersecurity Strategy, which is based on five key pillars:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The defence of critical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Disruption and dismantling of threat actors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shaping market forces to drive security and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Investing in a resilient future (including through workforce development).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Forging international partnerships to pursue shared goals.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These key pillars will be referenced throughout this section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new cyber-security strategy marks a change in the US approach to cyber policy, in so far as it aims to increase regulatory oversight and paves the way for further federal cyber-security regulation. By advancing an increasingly coordinated approach to cyber-security regulation, the strategy seeks to impose further binding obligations on the private sector, meaning that hardware and software vendors will be increasingly responsible for implementing cyber-security standards. If implemented into law, the new strategy proposes that technology companies may be liable for failing to implement these standards. This new cyber-security strategy is, however, in line with a number of recent US cyber policies, for example, the regulations on cyber security for oil and gas pipelines that were introduced after the 2021 Colonial Pipeline hack. Similarly, President Biden has increased binding obligations on businesses when introducing mandatory reporting for CNI operators experiencing a significant cyber attack (such as a ransomware attack). The new cyber-security strategy is the result of increased cooperation with the private sector, and this cooperation will remain a key component going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new cyber-security strategy also intends to streamline US policy and to coordinate regulatory efforts. Previously, the Biden administration has often relied upon presidential interventions (for example, Executive Order 14028), but Congress has also advanced additional legislation on cyber-security issues. However, Congress can challenge or subsequently legislate contrary to an Executive Order. Similarly, in terms of the new cyber strategy, one risk is that party division in Congress could limit progress on implementing the strategy’s objectives. As a result, some think that the ‘strategy won’t have any regulatory teeth itself’. The following sections take a closer look at specific aspects of US cyber-security strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Priorities for National Cyber-Resilience Measures for CNI One of the main pillars of the new US cyber-security strategy relates to defending CNI. In line with the broader shift towards top-down regulatory measures set out in the cyber-security strategy, a similar shift is proposed for measures protecting CNI. In light of significant threats facing the US, Anne Neuberger, deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology, considers that previous ‘voluntary efforts have been insufficient’. The new strategy thus intends to enhance regulation by establishing new cyber-security requirements in ‘certain critical sectors’ and by requiring new authorities to set regulations in other sectors. Currently, only some of the 16 critical infrastructure sectors are subject to regulation. While five sectors (nuclear power, large energy generation, chemicals, financial services and major defence contractors) were subject to regulation prior to the Biden administration taking office, the Colonial Pipeline attack led to the regulation of further sectors, i.e., oil and gas pipelines, and aviation and railways. It is expected that the Environmental Protection Agency will also issue similar regulations for the water sector, leaving five sectors which are not subject to the oversight of an authority that has the competence to launch federal cyber regulation. Here, Congress could legislate to enhance further binding cyber-security standards for these sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The protection of CNI is further advanced by the Cybersecurity &amp;amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), founded in 2018, which has recently published its first Strategic Plan (for 2023–25). It identifies four key priorities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Leading ‘the national effort to ensure the defense and resilience of cyberspace’.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reducing risk to CNI, but also increasing its resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fostering whole-of-nation operational collaboration and information-sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taking a unified approach as ‘[one] CISA through integrated functions, capabilities, and workforce’.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much of the US’s CNI is owned by the private sector, government cooperation with industry is particularly important. Relevant initiatives include CISA’s Automated Indicator Sharing Program, an early warning system enabling information-sharing between companies and public agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further cyber-security standards and best practices are also developed and shared by the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), which works closely with industry stakeholders and public agencies: for example, all federal agencies must implement its cyber-security standards. Although guidelines such as those developed under Executive Order 14028 on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity (May 2021) are primarily aimed at federal agencies, they can also be implemented by the private sector. One priority featured in the recent work of NIST is the protection of supply chains. NIST is currently working on updating its Cybersecurity Framework (CSF 2.0). Initially aimed at CNI only, this framework is now used more widely, and has been updated using private and civil sector input. A draft of the new framework is expected by summer 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Updated regulations and an increase in binding cyber-security obligations across an expanding number of sectors also means that companies are reliant on cyber-security professionals to implement such obligations. The cyber workforce in these areas must have the relevant skills to fulfil such tasks, both to comply with regulations and to uphold cyber security more generally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;workforce-and-skills-development-and-regulation-2&quot;&gt;Workforce and Skills Development and Regulation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The obligation to comply with new cyber-security standards is linked to another key pillar of the new US cyber-security strategy – the investment in greater resilience. This pillar includes the aim of strengthening the cyber workforce and envisages the development of a National Cyber Workforce and Education Strategy. Currently, the gap in the US cyber-security workforce is more than 410,000. A number of initiatives support efforts to fill this gap and improve skills development throughout the US; one noteworthy example of such efforts is the National Cyber Workforce and Education Summit that took place in July 2022, bringing together relevant stakeholders from the public and private sectors and from civil society. In this context, several further efforts were announced by multiple stakeholders, including a Cybersecurity Apprenticeship Sprint, which concluded in November 2022. The ‘sprint’ underlined a commitment to grow the adoption of apprenticeships as a pathway to employment in the US cyber-security workforce. The new cyber-security strategy also stresses the need for greater diversity, equity and inclusion in the cyber workforce. It thereby echoes previous efforts, such as a June 2021 Executive Order on Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility in the Federal Workforce. Several initiatives aim to increase such diversity, for example an internship programme seeking increased diversity in the New York City cyber workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further examples of initiatives supporting cyber-security awareness and skills development in the US are manifold. For example, the US Security and Exchange Commission has proposed new rules that require board members of publicly traded companies to disclose their cyber expertise. CISA has also set up awareness campaigns to increase national public awareness and enhance levels of cyber-security understanding. CISA also supports a range of online training courses and has a dedicated National Initiative for Cybersecurity Careers and Studies (NICCS). The CyberSkills2Work initiative (2020) enables military veterans to transition into a career in cyber security. Other initiatives – primarily aimed at the younger generations – involve a range of cyber-security games and competitions. Meanwhile, individuals keen on advancing their cyber-security skills can consult the Cybersecurity Workforce Training Guide, which, together with the Cyber Career Pathways Tool, allows individuals to set out a training planin line with their skill level. Businesses that want to identify the extent of the cyber-security workforce within a specific area, or the costs associated with hiring additional cyber-security staff, can also consult the CyberSeek initiative, which provides information and an interactive map on job postings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the gap in the cyber-security workforce persists, despite this wide range of initiatives on skills development, meaning that further research is required to better understand the effectiveness of these initiatives. Here, the newly proposed National Cyber Workforce and Education Strategy is intended to coordinate the US approach to developing a stronger and more diverse cyber workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To harmonise the terminology used to describe the tasks and skills of cyber-security professionals, the US has adopted the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Cybersecurity Workforce Framework. This sets out categories of common cyber-security functions, specialist areas of cyber-security work, and work roles, providing detailed descriptions of the required knowledge, skills and abilities for each role. Although initially launched in 2012, the current (fourth) version includes several updates made in 2020. The NICE Framework was initially advanced as a national initiative but has since been influential in many other jurisdictions, including Canada and Japan, underlining that workforce development is a global issue. Despite the widespread influence of the Framework, recent research indicates that US employers still find that graduates of US higher education institutions lack the NICE foundation. The NICE Framework continues to be updated, including through public consultation on updated Framework data such as knowledge and skills statements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;international-interaction-on-cyber-norm-development-2&quot;&gt;International Interaction on Cyber-Norm Development&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond its national policies, the US is a leader in international norm development on cyber security and the regulation of cyberspace. It strongly lobbies for a free, secure and open internet, and envisages a multi-stakeholder approach to the governance of cyberspace. This is reflected in a wide range of activities and initiatives, including the US-led (but now finished) UN Governmental Group of Experts, for which it sponsored a resolution for renewal for 2019–21, as well as multiple initiatives and exercises conducted with NATO Allies. Together with a range of like-minded countries, in 2019, the US advanced a statement on responsible state behaviour in cyberspace, supporting the efforts of UN working groups. The US also became part of the Paris Call, a multi-stakeholder initiative led by France and Microsoft, in 2021, after initially being absent from the initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional partnerships also allow the US to engage in ‘strategically-minded capacity building’, for example in cooperation with the African Union. Further partnerships such as the trilateral agreement AUKUS (with the UK and Australia) aim to strengthen cyber defence and resilience in the Indo-Pacific. Cyber security in the Indo-Pacific is further supported through the Quad, particularly in light of increased threats in this area stemming from China and North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US also indirectly advances norms through cooperation with other countries, for example when attributing cyber operations to states together with Five Eyes partners and others, or when imposing sanctions on cyber criminals (as was done more recently with the UK). In addition, a wide range of bilateral agreements further ensure US cooperation on cyber-security issues with like-minded jurisdictions such as Canada (on the protection of the shared energy infrastructure) and the UK (for a joint cyber academy). US cooperation with the EU is particularly noteworthy: after years of negotiations, the EU and the US recently agreed on a draft update for the EU–US data privacy framework, and in 2021 they set up the EU–US Trade and Technology Council for closer cooperation on digital transformation and technologies, based on shared values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With respect to workforce development, the new US cyber-security strategy acknowledges that workforce development is a global issue. The strategy therefore seeks to enhance cooperation with other countries and to learn from their experience to further develop a skilled and diverse cyber workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;canada&quot;&gt;Canada&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;context-3&quot;&gt;Context&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canada centres its cyber policy around its National Cyber Security Strategy, which was published in 2018. The core goals of this strategy were secure and resilient Canadian systems; an innovative and adaptive cyber ecosystem; and effective leadership, governance and collaboration. These goals remain valid, and an action plan guides their implementation. The 2021 mid-review of the strategy found that its targets were being met, including the establishment of the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security, but that challenges persist ‘in meeting the growing demands for cyber talent’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cyber-threat landscape has expanded since the publication of Canada’s National Cyber Security Strategy. While Canada has highly developed cyber-security systems, it is also one of the most targeted countries, especially when it comes to cybercrime. The head of the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security wrote in 2022 that ‘Cybercrime is still the number one cyber threat activity affecting Canadians [and the] state-sponsored cyber programs of China, Russia, Iran and North Korea continue to pose the greatest strategic cyber threat to Canada’. Canada’s internet usage has increased since the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, thereby also expanding the threat surface, both for individuals and for organisations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although they were not caused by cyber attacks, Canada experienced internet outages in 2021 and 2022 that demonstrated the vitalness of stable connectivity and the highly connected nature of critical infrastructure sectors. The increased risk to critical infrastructure was confirmed by the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security’s cyber-threat assessment for 2023–24. Threats include that posed by state-sponsored cyber operations; influence-seeking by cyber-threat actors that are ‘degrading trust in online spaces’; and ransomware attacks and other forms of cybercrime targeting Canadians and Canadian organisations. Canadian cyber policy focuses on adapting to this changing threat landscape and on tackling continuing issues, such as shortages of the cyber-security professionals necessary for ensuring resilience in the context of the morphing threat landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;priorities-for-national-cyber-resilience-measures-for-cni-2&quot;&gt;Priorities for National Cyber-Resilience Measures for CNI&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like other jurisdictions discussed in this paper, Canada stresses the importance of increasing the resilience of its critical infrastructure. Canada defines its critical infrastructure as comprising 10 sectors. Canadian CNI has been subject to several significant cyber incidents, in particular the healthcare sector and local government. The National Cyber Threat Assessment 2023–2024 points out that critical infrastructure depends on its supply chains, making CNI especially vulnerable as attackers might first target a supplier to infiltrate or disrupt CNI. Despite deteriorating relations with Russia and China, however, Canada’s 2023–24 Cyber Threat Assessment concludes that ‘state-sponsored cyber threat actors will very likely refrain from intentionally disrupting or destroying Canadian critical infrastructure in the absence of direct hostilities’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To further secure its CNI, Canada has ‘increased bilateral collaboration with the United States on critical energy infrastructure protection’. In June 2022, Canada introduced Bill C-26, which requires designated operators (i.e., those providing vital services, including in the energy, finance, transport and telecommunications sectors) to increase their cyber-security measures and to report attacks. If the bill becomes law, such measures will be enforceable by the authorities with the help of audit powers, fines and even criminal penalties. This legislation, if passed, would have a direct impact on private companies operating in Canada. If designated as operators under Bill C-26, companies will have to establish, maintain and review a cyber-security programme within 90 days, report incidents, comply with directions and maintain records of incidents and compliance. Implementing such suggested obligations will require a skilled cyber workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government’s bill has been criticised as ‘potentially impair[ing] the ability of private companies to dispute demands, orders, or regulations that are issued by the government’ and for having ‘overly broad secrecy clauses’, raising concerns over transparency and accountability. Others see the mandatory reporting and information sharing between agencies as necessary steps to combat cybercrime, which in turn benefits both organisations and individuals. The bill recently finished its second reading in the Canadian House of Commons, and has yet to go to the Senate, and so it could still be amended over the course of the legislative procedure, but it could become law in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;workforce-and-skills-development-and-regulation-3&quot;&gt;Workforce and Skills Development and Regulation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with the other jurisdictions examined in this paper, the implementation of cyber-security obligations in Canada and the achievement of good cyber-security standards more generally there – in order to increase the country’s cyber resilience – requires a skilled cyber workforce. The shortage in Canada’s cyber-security workforce remains stable but considerable. Canada actively competes for the skilled workers it needs, particularly with the US. As US entities pay relatively higher salaries, the US is an attractive place of work for Canadians. While this leads to the risk of a ‘brain drain’ in the Canadian cyber-security sector, some commentators see lower Canadian wages as an opportunity for investors in the cyber-security sector. Within Canada itself the number of job postings among the different provinces varies considerably, with Ontario serving as the main hub of cyber-security-related jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With respect to cyber workforce qualifications, Canada provides both formal cyber-security education (through universities) and a range of complementary options via online courses, coding bootcamps and certification schemes. Furthermore, the Future Skills Centre supports a number of initiatives aimed at diversifying Canada’s cyber-security workforce, for example the Canadian Cybersecurity Skills and Talent Transformation scheme, a joint project with Rogers Cybersecure Catalyst. Canada has also adopted a Cybersecurity Skills Framework, which largely overlaps with the established US Cyber Security Workforce Framework (NICE), but which focuses on the needs of the Canadian labour market and SMEs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, in 2022 the Canadian Chamber of Commerce – in cooperation with tech companies and civil society – demanded publicly that the government further prioritise the cyber-security sector, including bolstering the cyber-security workforce ‘by investing in cybersecurity education, talent development, retention and programs that diversify and expand the cyber workforce’. TECHNATION, a not-for-profit initiative representing Canadian technology companies, lists four main challenges for workforce development in Canada, including: the need to generate and retain cyber security talent; the need for technical and non-technical roles to gain sufficient knowledge, skills and abilities; and the need to normalise cyber security within the workplace. In addition, the Canadian workforce must be ‘responsive to the changing technology landscape’. In February 2023, the Canadian government announced additional support in the form of 250 million CAD for upskilling its workforce, including in the cyber-security profession, with the help of short-cycle upskilling programmes run in partnership with Palette Skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;international-interaction-on-cyber-norm-development-3&quot;&gt;International Interaction on Cyber-Norm Development&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canada has been an active partner for international cyber-norm development, for example when advocating for an open, secure and multi-stakeholder-led internet, and supporting the application of existing international law and norms of responsible behaviour in cyberspace. Canada is not in favour of the conclusion of a new international law treaty on the regulation of cyberspace. Instead, in 2022, Canada published its interpretation of existing international law applicable to cyberspace, and has promoted the applicability of norms of responsible state behaviour in various forums, such as the G7, the G20 and NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its international cooperation on cyber policy, Canada is focused in particular on ‘help[ing] other countries expand their capacity building activities’, which has been ‘a key aspect of Canada’s cyber engagement strategy’. This commitment is demonstrated in a number of initiatives, focusing largely on Latin America, the Caribbean and Southeast Asia. For example, Canada has contributed significantly to cyber capacity-building, especially in Latin America, by allocating funds to the Anti-Crime Capacity Building Program. Similarly, Canada works with the Inter-American Committee against Terrorism to improve participation in UN processes on cybercrime and cyber-security negotiations. Within the Organisation of American States, Canada also funded a project (as of 2022) to support other member states in targeting and understanding the implications of the gender gap in the cyber-security workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In cooperation with other allies, especially the Five Eyes community, Canada has repeatedly attributed malicious cyber activities to other states. It has also funded projects related to how attribution can be made. Attribution is critical, as it helps to hold malicious actors accountable, and is in line with Canada’s increasingly active role in this and other related areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;japan&quot;&gt;Japan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;context-4&quot;&gt;Context&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Japan, the award of the 2020 Olympic Games prompted a significant increase in cyber-security awareness. Aiming to protect the 2020 Olympic Summer Games from cyber attacks, the Japanese government launched widespread campaigns to build up cyber resilience (including in the private sector) and to educate the workforce. The Olympics thus arguably served as a springboard for further raising cyber-security standards in the Japanese private sector. This aim was also reflected in the country’s 2018 Cyber Security Strategy (for 2018–21), which focused primarily on the Olympic and Paralympic Games, recognising ‘the potential cyber threat from hostile states’, and referring on its first page to the growing danger of ‘organised, sophisticated, and possibly state-sponsored’ cyber attacks. Japan’s cyber-security strategy thus focuses on protecting critical infrastructure, on stakeholder cooperation, and on the improvement of cyber security in the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these approaches were widely considered to have been successful in protecting the (Covid-19-delayed) Olympic Games, the priorities outlined above remain highly relevant in 2023. However, Japan’s approach to cyber security changed significantly in 2022, in light of an increasing number of cyber attacks against the country, and in particular given the deteriorating relationships with China and Russia. While still in the process of determining a cyber-security budget for 2024, Japan announced a significant change in its cyber strategy, including the adoption of an active cyber defence. Japan had previously alluded to deterrence capabilities in its 2018 strategy, but the recent shift is significant. Some even consider it to be a ‘turning point’ for Japan’s defence policy, which is traditionally limited by Japan’s pacifist constitution (as well as by privacy considerations). This recent shift constitutes an atypical, proactive approach, which is considered necessary to ‘actively pre-empt and stop attacks before they reach Japan’s systems’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, Japan primarily pursues a top-down approach when advancing cyber-security measures domestically, relying predominantly on ‘government regulators to establish cyber-security requirements’. Japanese cyber-security policy includes key areas such as the protection of national infrastructure and the development of the cyber workforce, which will be addressed in more detail in the following sections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;priorities-for-national-cyber-resilience-measures-for-cni-3&quot;&gt;Priorities for National Cyber-Resilience Measures for CNI&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the key issues in Japanese cyber policy are the protection of critical infrastructure and improving the resilience of supply chains, as well as wider cyber-security awareness, particularly in the private sector. While ‘Japan remains a world leader in cyberspace technologies’, its own cyber-security standards have raised concerns in the past, for example in the US, which has criticised Japan’s weak cyber-security practices and has considered these to be a barrier to deeper cooperation and intelligence sharing. Yet the US and Japan have been working to overcome these differences through bilateral talks, including signing a Memorandum of Cooperation on Cybersecurity in January 2023 to strengthen the collaboration between the two countries in the area of cyber security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s CNI is primarily owned by the private sector. The Basic Cyber Security Act entails duties for operators of critical infrastructure businesses, a group that has expanded in recent years, and which now includes 14 sectors. However, these obligations are often vague, for example when requiring that CNI providers ‘deepen [their] interest in and understanding of the importance of cybersecurity’, and information-sharing on cyber incidents remains limited, for cultural and structural reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an updated action plan from June 2022, the National Center of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity (NISC) offers guidance for safety standards and information-sharing systems to further improve cyber-security standards in Japan. The plan, which is only available in Japanese, further recommends that businesses develop risk-management procedures, and sets out specific requirements to be met by CNI businesses and staff, including Chief Information Security Officers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Japan passed an economic security bill in May 2022 that provides greater protection for supply chains and infrastructure with regard to cyber attacks. More specifically, it imposes obligations on companies in critical infrastructure sectors to inform the government of software updates and to ‘vet some equipment procurement’. The private sector requires a skilled workforce to implement these obligations and to raise cyber-security awareness and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond these measures, Japan continues to strengthen its strategic partnership with the US on cyber cooperation to ensure greater resilience, particularly if confronted with hostile actions by China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;workforce-and-skills-development-and-regulation-4&quot;&gt;Workforce and Skills Development and Regulation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like other jurisdictions dealt with in this paper, Japan is experiencing shortages in the cyber-security workforce, and overall cyber-security awareness is arguably relatively low in Japan. This situation is augmented as many Japanese companies outsource their IT and cyber-security work, resulting in smaller in-house teams compared with other countries. Furthermore, Japanese work culture traditionally foresees a high rate of job rotation, which comes at the cost of acquiring specialised cyber-security skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To respond to these skill shortages, the Japanese government has supported cyber-security skills development, for example by inaugurating the National Cyber Training Center (NICT), which offers training courses, especially for under-25s, and the Industrial Cyber Security Center of Excellence for training for mid-career and senior professionals. The NICT established a training programme, Cyber Colosseo, in advance of the Olympic Games, and also holds CYDER defence exercises, particularly for government officials and CNI businesses. However, information in English remains limited. To establish a common language for cyber-security skills, Japan has previously adopted the US NICE workforce framework, a choice made attractive by the fact that many Japanese companies outsource their IT outside Japan, and require an international understanding of what cyber-security talents are needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individuals qualified in this area are thus in high demand in Japan and have good job opportunities. One IT recruitment agency reports that qualifications such as (ISC)²’s Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) are considered useful; that there is an increased demand for cloud engineers, such as Amazon Web Services engineers; and that demand is particularly high for personnel related to public cloud services such as SaaS and IaaS. The Japanese Ministry of Defense is also increasing its role as an employer of cyber-security workers, and has plans to increase cyber-defence personnel, aiming to expand today’s 800 staff members to 5,000 by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An initiative involving academia, government and the private sector founded the Cross-Sector Forum (2015) ‘to build an ecosystem to educate, recruit, retain, and train cybersecurity talent’ in Japan. The Forum has been active in advancing definitions of relevant talents and skills, and has created guidelines and provided funding for universities for cyber-security courses on which staff members of consortium partners can teach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;international-interaction-on-cyber-norm-development-4&quot;&gt;International Interaction on Cyber-Norm Development&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside these domestic policy considerations focused on increasing resilience and workforce development, Japan undertakes cyber-security diplomacy based on three main principles: the promotion of the rule of law; cooperation on capacity building; and the development of confidence-building measures. Japan has also contributed to discussions on norm development in cyberspace, for example by participating in several rounds of UN expert group discussions on cyber norms; and, in 2021, it made a public statement on its interpretation of international law in cyberspace in the UN forum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With respect to norm development, Japan has stressed a preference for voluntary and non-binding norms on responsible state behaviour in cyberspace (as identified by the UN Group of Governmental Experts (UN GGE) report in 2015), and has voiced caution, both about extending these norms and about what it sees as the risk of prematurely debating a binding new treaty. Japan is a member of the Budapest Convention against Cybercrime and, as of 2022, had joined NATO’s Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence. The country is also a regular participant in the ASEAN Regional Forum’s efforts on cyber issues and participates in the G7 Cyber Expert Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan also supports a number of capacity-building initiatives. These are coordinated by the NISC and focus primarily on ASEAN states. They include the annual ASEAN–Japan Cybersecurity Policy meeting and related working groups and activities. Since 2018, Japan has funded the ASEAN–Japan Cybersecurity Capacity Building Centre, which supports talent development for the region’s cyber-security workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan has a range of bilateral agreements to strengthen technology and cyber cooperation with other countries, for example with the US and the UK. With respect to the latter, both nations are currently seeking to ‘make it easier for businesses to operate in both countries by aligning approaches to digital regulation’; to improve cyber resilience; and to ‘promote initiatives to standardise the security of internet-connected products and apps’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;singapore&quot;&gt;Singapore&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;context-5&quot;&gt;Context&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singapore is a highly digitalised city state with advanced cyber-security regulation and policies. But as ‘the cyber ecosystem in Singapore is expanding rapidly’, Singapore has also experienced a high number of cyber attacks in recent years, for example in the form of ‘SMS-phishing scams targeting bank customers’. One study finds that 65% of organisations in Singapore were hit by ransomware attacks in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To respond to the changing threat landscape and boost cyber resilience, Singapore updated its cyber-security strategy in 2021. This now rests on three strategic pillars: building resilient infrastructure; enabling a safer cyberspace; and enhancing international cyber cooperation. In addition, the strategy identifies two foundational enablers: developing a vibrant cyber-security ecosystem; and growing a robust talent pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these priorities in mind, Singapore’s strategy is that of a nation that ‘has long set its sights on becoming a world-class, tech-driven city-state’ and which, as a consequence, considers cyber security to be a matter of national security. As regulation remains critical to supporting cyber resilience, Singapore’s government ‘explore[s] expanding the government’s regulatory remit’ under the updated cyber-security act, for example, to further expand regulation beyond CNI businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Singapore has launched multiple initiatives and projects in coordination with other countries and the private sector that seek to enhance cyber resilience and to educate and cultivate a much-needed IT workforce. One way the government seeks private sector engagement is through the Cybersecurity Industry Call for Innovation 2022, in which the government invites cyber-security businesses to join the effort to identify and develop ‘innovative solutions to address specific cybersecurity challenges’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;priorities-for-national-cyber-resilience-measures-for-cni-4&quot;&gt;Priorities for National Cyber-Resilience Measures for CNI&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As outlined in its cyber-security strategy, building a resilient infrastructure is a key pillar of Singapore’s cyber policy. To further enhance cyber-resilience measures for Critical Information Structure (CII), that is, any ‘computer or computer system located wholly or partly in Singapore’ that is ‘necessary for the continuous delivery of an essential service’, Singapore’s Cyber Security Agency (CSA) has launched a supply chain programme. This comes in the context of the increasingly complex threat landscape, but also in response to advanced digitalisation in the post-pandemic environment. The programme sets out five initiatives, including a toolkit, a handbook, a certification scheme and a learning hub, designed to support businesses in the sector, as well as a platform for international cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A complementary code of practice (CCoP 2.0) sets out measures and standards that businesses in the respective CII sectors must implement. The second edition of these standards of performance came into force in July 2022 and ‘specifies the minimum requirements’ that businesses in these sectors must adhere to. Companies can, however, request waivers of requirements for valid reasons. The CCoP further provides, among other things, incident response plans, and sets out design principles for cyber security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These increased cyber-security obligations have to be implemented by businesses and the cyber workforce. However, this can prove challenging, for example with respect to the CII supply chain guide, which some have perceived as offering limited concrete points for companies to implement, for instance in case of a supply chain attack or to prevent supply chain risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;workforce-and-skills-development-and-regulation-5&quot;&gt;Workforce and Skills Development and Regulation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to other jurisdictions examined in this paper, Singapore’s shortage in the cyber-security workforce lessened significantly in 2022. As it is Singapore’s ambition to be a world leader in all things cyber, the government of Singapore has introduced a broad set of measures to attract highly skilled workers, including those in the IT sector. Alongside five-year visas and visa programmes such as the TechPass, Singapore has an advanced digital infrastructure, ensuring that it is an attractive place to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even where favourable conditions and the right regulations are in place, ‘digital transformation will remain but a vision without the right talent to execute it’, according to Senior Minister of State Tan Kiat How. To secure such talent, further initiatives like the TechSkills Accelerator create links between students from education institutions such as the Singapore Institute of Technology and private sector companies, for example in the form of internship programmes. At the same time, there have been calls for companies to engage in more skills-based assessments, rather than relying on formal academic qualifications during hiring processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In line with Singapore’s preference for regulation of the cyber-security sector, businesses providing cyber-security services and operating in Singapore are also subject to several regulatory frameworks. For example, where businesses offer penetration testing or managed security operations centre monitoring services, as of 2022, they are required to obtain a licence. Such measures, which could still be extended to other cyber-security services, are intended to protect consumer interests as well as to ‘improve service providers’ standards and standing over time’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singapore’s CSA has also initiated a certification scheme that recognises businesses that have ‘adopted and implemented good cybersecurity practices’. More concretely, SMEs can achieve the CSA’s ‘Cyber Essentials’ standard, which recognises good cyber-hygiene practices. For larger and international corporations, the CSA launched the ‘Cyber Trust’ mark, which recognises ‘comprehensive measures and practices’. The CSA’s CEO, David Koh, sees the certification system as a means for companies to demonstrate their commitment ‘to ensure that they remain cyber-secure, giving them an edge over their competitors’ while simultaneously ‘providing greater assurance to their customers’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;international-interaction-on-cyber-norm-development-5&quot;&gt;International Interaction on Cyber-Norm Development&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the strategic pillars of Singapore’s 2021 cyber-security strategy aims to enhance international cyber cooperation to ‘foster an open, secure, stable, accessible, peaceful, and interoperable cyberspace’. Singapore is already proactively engaging in a wide range of initiatives fostering international cooperation on cyber matters. For example, Singapore has been an active participant in UN norm processes, including the UN’s GGE and the Open-Ended Working Group, where Singapore has called for a ‘UN cyber fellowship program for small states that would support the training in cyber issues for mid- to senior level officials from smaller developing countries’. Furthermore, Singapore co-chairs, with Estonia, the UN Group on e-governance and cybersecurity, and chairs the UN Group of Friends on Digital Technologies, in cooperation with Finland and Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singapore hosts the annual Singapore International Cyber Week, a high-level event on cyber security fostering cooperation in the field, including on norm implementation. Singapore has also been active in regional capacity building, for example when it announced in 2019 that it would provide around $22 million for the establishment of the ASEAN–Singapore Cybersecurity Centre of Excellence which, among other things, trains computer emergency response teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To further support these ambitions, Singapore has multiple bilateral agreements with countries such as Australia, Japan, France, Germany, the UK and the US, all working on improving cyber capabilities in Southeast Asia. In late 2022, the Inaugural US–Singapore Cyber Dialogue was held, providing a platform of exchange for officials to discuss both further cooperation and topics such as supply-chain security, cyber capacity building, and cyber talent and workforce development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;concluding-remarks&quot;&gt;Concluding Remarks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following concluding remarks set out initial comparative observations based on the research underlying this paper, and point to areas that require further research to better understand the various regulatory approaches to cyber-security issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All the jurisdictions discussed in this paper have advanced a cyber strategy. While these strategies certainly take into account the cyber threat landscape and wider global contexts, aspects of the strategies remain specific to each jurisdiction (such as the Olympic Games in Japan). However, some common themes can be observed across the strategies:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Strategies are regularly updated in line with domestic timelines, but they also respond to international events. In the timeframe examined for this paper, recent trends include the rise of cybercrime, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, heightened tensions between China and Taiwan, and the increased need to secure CNI and supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;These strategy updates increasingly focus on harmonising and streamlining each jurisdiction’s existing and developing cyber policies. Such harmonisation is advanced to avoid both fragmentation and the duplication of effort. This is reflected in the UK’s 2022 strategy and its ‘whole of society’ approach, and in the EU’s efforts to move away from a sectoral approach towards a more cohesive cyber policy, including the development of a skilled cyber workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There is a noticeable trend towards interventionist policies that emphasise regulatory approaches to cyber security, rather than voluntary standards. This trend was already apparent in the UK’s 2016 cyber strategy, and is now also reflected in the US’s 2023 National Cybersecurity Strategy. In line with this trend, businesses and cyber-security professionals must anticipate regulatory changes if they are to keep up with varying and increasingly binding obligations.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Greater protection of CNI is a priority for all the jurisdictions discussed in this paper. Although the number and scope of sectors categorised as CNI varies from one jurisdiction to another, many of the designated sectors are common. Further efforts to advance mandatory cyber-security measures beyond CNI sectors is also a priority for many jurisdictions, which again has a direct impact on businesses and the cyber-security professionals who have to implement them. Thus businesses and cyber-security professionals have to simultaneously comply with changing and at times varying obligations among different jurisdictions – particularly if they operate internationally. Further research comparing and contrasting the varying scope of CNI designations and the respective cyber-security obligations for businesses and cyber-security professionals could help clarify ways for them to navigate the different requirements, and identify the skills required from the workforce where businesses operate across a range of jurisdictions. Further research could also explore opportunities and approaches for harmonising the range of frameworks, policies, initiatives and changing regulations that currently exist.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although often a whole range of tools, frameworks and initiatives improving public–private partnerships are available to guide businesses in implementing these measures, it is not always clear what these obligations entail in detail. This is especially true for non-binding or vague standards. Although much information is available in English, where this is not the case it is especially challenging for external businesses and cyber-security professionals to understand how to comply with these obligations. Again, further comparative research would help businesses and cyber-security professionals understand the practical impact of changing regulations, new cyber-security measures and – especially – the varying obligations they must comply with, such as reporting requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A common theme seen across all the jurisdictions examined is the shortage of personnel in the cyber-security workforce, exacerbated by global events and trends, such as the Covid-19 pandemic and increased digitalisation. In fact, many of the jurisdictions outlined here compete directly with each other for skilled workers (for example, the US and Canada) or rely heavily on outside cyber expertise (as is the case for Japan). Governments have responded to such shortages by acknowledging the need to improve skills development through a range of initiatives. Many of the measures in place across the different jurisdictions resemble one another, especially where they focus on attracting young people to cyber-security professions, or involve adopting skills frameworks such as NICE or the ECSF to harmonise the language used to describe cyber-security roles. Some jurisdictions prioritise specific aspects in their efforts to support a robust talent pipeline, for example when aiming for greater diversity with respect to gender (Canada, the US) and region (the UK). However, despite the multitude of initiatives fostering skills development, little is known about their effectiveness. More research is needed to understand which initiatives help eliminate discrepancies between education and the demands of industry and, as a result, reduce the gaps in the cyber-security workforce. Singapore would make an interesting case study, providing further insights into the effectiveness of measures taken in 2022, when the city state was successful in reducing its gap in the cyber workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overall, the jurisdictions studied in this paper share a cooperative, proactive attitude to the development of norms applicable to cyberspace, and seek to advance a free and secure internet. All entities covered are active supporters of the UN processes for norm development in cyberspace and engage in a range of multilateral, bilateral and multi-stakeholder arrangements, seeking greater cooperation on cyber issues with other states, regional organisations, and the private sector. Areas for cooperation include norm development and capacity building, but also the development of cyber-security skills and closing the gap in the cyber workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙盤問下亦同意，參選超級區議會的李予信是「溫和、務實、新晉」的傳統民主派，亦同意超區界別是2012年政府與民主黨政治妥協的產物。趙指「妥協係政治嘅藝術」，他當年任民主黨中央委員時，亦支持黨友投票通過政府的政改方案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指新東第二次會議無進行過投票-趙不同意&quot;&gt;辯方指新東第二次會議無進行過投票 趙不同意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢繼續接受代表鄒家成的大律師陳世傑盤問，根攄黎敬輝就5月5日第二次新東會議的筆記，寫有「『會運用』 - 投票通過」。趙同意當時嘗試向黎敬輝了解情況，指相信民主黨代表李永成無獲授權表態，而黎則引戴耀廷指「份協議要去出最後版本」，望以表決形式「畀一個主流嘅大方向出嚟」。趙其後再找戴，指民主黨代表應不獲授權投票，對結果感詫異，戴則回應會採用大方向起草最終協議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑問，戴是否沒告訴他曾舉行投票並通過決議？趙重申是非正式的意向性投票，戴是望以此拿到「大方向」。李運騰追問，不論正式或非正式，戴有否確認曾進行投票？趙稱「係有一個投票」。陳世傑最終指出，事實上第二次會議沒有進行投票，亦沒有進行意向性投票，趙不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙同意不清楚就運用否決權有否達成共識-指戴耀廷清楚民主黨有保留&quot;&gt;趙同意不清楚就運用否決權有否達成共識 指戴耀廷清楚民主黨有保留&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙同意，戴耀廷原本打算要求參選人簽署協議，但在6月9日記者會稱毋須簽署，而戴在他要求下，於6月8日在組織者群組發出各區協議的最後版本，他並稱之為各區共識。趙同意不知道協議如何產生，「戴耀廷冇特別同我講」，而他稱之為「共識」是因為戴這樣告訴他。他亦同意新東第二次會議至6月8日之間，不曾有其他新東會議，被問是否知道就運用否決權的條款有達成共識，趙答「我唔清楚」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑續指，事實上會上就否決權有不同意見，但戴耀廷則自行（took upon）決定同意了的內容，並引趙早前曾同意法官陳慶偉指，民主陣營光譜很闊，如在否決財政預算案上社民連和本土抗爭派意見不同，最終部分選區同意使用「會運用」否決權，即使有參與者未必完全同意，但戴還是做了決定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡續引黎敬輝筆記，指戴會上曾提及「會議共識是較多數人的認同，接納可接受的方案」，指與趙說法相符。趙同意，並指辯方遺漏了他會後曾向戴提出民主黨有關注和顧慮，而戴稱會與民主黨或對否決預算案有顧慮的人作處理，又重申戴會駕車周圍與不同參選人溝通接觸。陳仲衡問，故戴耀廷清楚知道民主黨有保留？趙同意，指「我同佢嘅溝通當中，佢係清楚知道，所以佢同我承諾話佢會跟進」，而他亦接受了戴的說法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指若非有共識戴不可能召記者會-否則會有反彈&quot;&gt;趙指若非有共識戴不可能召記者會 否則會有反彈&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指，辯方是向趙指出，事實上沒有大家同意的協議，而是由戴耀廷決定協議內容。趙回應就當時情況而言，若戴並非確認到參與的持分者是同意，又或是在該氣氛下受壓力同意，惟陳慶偉打斷問是指哪個時間點，問是否指6月9日記者會。趙同意並語氣急促指，若戴「唔係喺5月5日至6月9日中間確認好有共識係處理好嘅話，佢唔可能係同意然後叫我去準備個記者會去講出嚟，因為公開咗嘅話，如果有人唔同意就會即刻反彈㗎嘛」，並指原本的構思，是想每個參與者報名時都有「實體簽名」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，即趙是指根據原本計劃，候選人需簽署協議，故若事實上沒有共識，而戴又自行決定，便會引起候選人的爭論？趙同意。陳世傑續指，在5個地方選區中，只有兩個區作出回應並簽署文件，陳慶偉補充即附上共同綱領。趙略為激動以雙手比劃，並大聲說：「抱歉我答唔到，個事實情況唔係咁樣，即係你將幾樣嘢痴埋一齊嚟講嘅」，鄒家成發笑。李運騰指問題很簡單，即是否只有兩區參選人報名時附上共同綱領，趙冷靜下來表示同意，指該份共同綱領「係佢哋各自區自己攞咗戴耀廷份嘢嘅一啲元素擺落去整出嚟嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續展示組織者群組 WhatsApp 紀錄，趙家賢6月19日曾稱「區軒同埋 Benny 係有白紙黑字 circulate 畀大家確認，雖然冇最後簽紙，但係呢個都係一個 mutually agreed consents（互相同意的協議）」，趙在李詢問下，指「我當時係真誠地確信」有互相同意的協議，並重申是指戴在6月8日發出的協議最後版本。李再問趙是否相信戴有將協議傳給所有人？趙指因戴曾說過會傳閱通知予有關參選人，他亦有看到戴使用廣播功能，加上他曾問一兩個參與協調者，他們均反映有透過廣播收到該文件，故當時真誠確信。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙不同意抗爭一詞只是代表更積極主動傳統民主派好多人都-chur-住政府官員&quot;&gt;趙不同意「抗爭」一詞只是代表更積極主動：傳統民主派好多人都 chur 住政府官員&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑其後問到「本土抗爭派」的意思，問趙是否同意「本土抗爭派」是形容較年輕、並以港人利益為先的本土政治人物，趙表示「部分同意，因為呢個只係最基本嘅一啲元素」，在延伸庭的黃之鋒發笑。陳再指，當中「抗爭」一詞不是代表他們反建制或反政府，只是他們更願意更積極主動地（proactively）爭取政治目標，趙不同意，並指「傳統民主派裡面都有好多人就住政策嗰方面，係好進取去 chur 住啲政府官員要起啲地區建設等等，你頭先講嘅係一個好溫和嘅方法之一」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續指，「本土抗爭派」包含不同人士，有些可能很反政府，有些則不是，因此很難給予整體答案，或者辯方可指出他們「不一定（not necessarily）」是這樣。法官陳慶偉則認為，如辯方希望，可直接向證人指出鄒家成很溫和，又或他是激進但不反政府。陳世傑一度指，鄒家成可能很主動發聲，但不一定是非法，但陳慶偉指兩者沒有關係，李運騰亦強調本案不是取決於被告屬於什麼陣營，陳世傑續指已完成盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指超區是政府與民主黨妥協產物-趙妥協係政治嘅藝術&quot;&gt;辯方指「超區」是政府與民主黨妥協產物 趙：妥協係政治嘅藝術&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;柯耀林沒有盤問，代表李予信的大律師關文渭接着盤問。李予信參選區議會（第二）功能界別（超級區議會），關問「超區」的界別是否2012年時，政府與民主黨政治妥協（compromise）的產物，法官陳仲衡一度質疑他在問證人的意見，但關稱趙當時有份參與，陳慶偉批准發問。趙續回答：「係，妥協係政治嘅藝術」，並指自己當時是民主黨的中央委員，「喺2010年嘅政改方案，我都支持民主黨嘅立法會議員投票通過當時政府嘅政改方案」，他亦同意因此導致超區出現。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指超區選民為草根階層-法官我是草根階層嗎&quot;&gt;辯方指超區選民為草根階層 法官：我是草根階層嗎？&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關續指，有兩個條件可成為此界別的選民，首先他並非其他功能界別選民，第二是他沒有取消登記超區的界別，趙同意。陳慶偉問即選民若沒有取消登記，會自動成為超區的選民？關同意，李運騰並一度指法官並非任何功能組別的選民，但不記得曾被要求取消登記，關指李可能忘記了。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後法官與辯方就選民資格討論，關表示超區與其他功能組別有別，並非代表商界等利益，而超區選民主要是「草根階層（grassroot citizens）」，這時李運騰表示：「我也是區議會（第二）的選民，我是草根階層嗎？（“I am also voter of DC2, did I consdier myself as grassroot?”）」，陳慶偉亦指他曾經是衞生服務界的選民，多人發笑。關其後問，這些一般市民並非由其他特定界別代表？趙表示：「呢方面我比較熟悉，或者我講解清楚」，但陳慶偉即擺手打斷稱：「我們已經明白」，多人大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙同意李予信是溫和務實新晉的傳統民主派&quot;&gt;趙同意李予信是「溫和、務實、新晉」的傳統民主派&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙其後確認，於2020年與李予信為東區區議會的同事，當時趙為副主席，李則是成員，當時政府會就建設項目提出臨時撥款。關續問，李予信是否經常會對撥款投贊成票，並舉例指北角糖水道需150萬進行拆除天橋的工程，而該筆撥款需區議會通過。趙未回答，陳慶偉便指區議會只是諮詢機構（consultative body），不認為政府須獲區議會允許（permission），提醒辯方注意用詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/sp7IUG6.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 李予信&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關改問，政府在地區建設前，要尋求區議會同意？趙同意並指：「因為好多地區部門都好重視區議會意見，唔單止工作、交通、一啲規劃，全部係透過地區部門、透過區議會去攞意見，有啲做法當然希望區議會能夠通過。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，關問到趙有否私下跟李就2015年政府政改失敗等議題討論，趙稱應該有。被問到會否視李為溫和、務實的新晉民主派，趙表示李是「溫和、務實、新晉嘅傳統民主派」。李聞言微笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關文渭表示完成盤問。由於昨日趙家賢就鄭達鴻及彭卓棋早前的盤問作補充，代表鄭的大律師黃宇逸表示可能會再有盤問，陳慶偉今指，法庭考慮後決定批准黃及代表彭的大律師盧敏儀發問，但兩人最後表示沒有問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/PlrAqD8.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（25日）踏入審訊第50天。前民主動力召集人趙家賢接受主問及盤問共17天，今作供完畢，料下一名控方證人為同案認罪被告、民主動力副召集人鍾錦麟。控方午休前表示，上周六（22日）始破解鍾錦麟電話，需時處理披露資料事宜。法官李運騰指情況非常不理想，指電話一直由警方保管，為何審訊第50天仍要處理此基本程序，又問控方是否未獲鍾合作。控方下午解釋，由於鍾不肯定電話密碼，警方為免資料被刪而沒有冒險嘗試，並因科技進步於上周六始成功破解。控方不會依賴當中逾2,400則訊息，辯方則需時審視，案件押後至明天繼續。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指上周六始破解鍾錦麟電話需時考慮披露資料-法官指非常不理想&quot;&gt;控方指上周六始破解鍾錦麟電話、需時考慮披露資料 法官指非常不理想&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;所有被告今早完成盤問趙家賢，並由主控萬德豪進行覆問。萬覆問完成後指預計會傳召另一認罪被告鍾錦麟，惟有事情需於午飯時處理。在趙離開後，萬解釋警方於上周六破解了鍾的電話，並考慮披露當中某些資料。李運騰問因此控方需在傳證人前考慮披露的問題？萬同意，並要檢視控方會否依賴當中的材料。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰嘆氣，問電話一直是由警方抑或鍾錦麟保管？萬答是由警方保管。李指情況非常不理想，指現時已是審訊第50天，為何控方此前沒有檢視，又指控方在開審前檢視手提電話是很基本，問能否於今天之內處理好。萬指很有可能，並指可解釋為什麼要檢視該些材料，李運騰打斷指，「我認為你欠所有人一個解釋。（“I think you owe everybody an explanation of this.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方稱科技進步才能破解-官質疑是否未獲證人合作&quot;&gt;控方稱「科技進步」才能破解 官質疑是否未獲證人合作&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬續指，因為科技的進步（advancement of technology），他們現時能破解鍾的電話。李問，所以控方此前未能解鎖鍾的電話，即控方未能獲得鍾錦麟的合作？並指若鍾不願提供密碼，辯方或會關注為何控方未能得到鍾的全盤合作。萬德豪指會於午飯後回答。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/c4EGgIb.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
▲ 鍾錦麟（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，就案件的進度，李運騰指鍾錦麟所需時間應沒有首兩名證人般長，並問第四名證人是誰。萬德豪指還會有專家證人及與證物鏈相關的證人，亦會為證人申請匿名令，大律師關文渭指辯方沒有反對控方申匿名令，只是提出細微的修改。代表林卓廷和黃碧雲的大律師沈士文亦問及傳召次序，指除鍾外尚有一名匿名證人及市民證人，萬同指會於午飯後回答。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指鍾錦麟不肯定電話密碼-為免資料被刪故無冒險嘗試&quot;&gt;控方指鍾錦麟不肯定電話密碼 為免資料被刪故無冒險嘗試&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪午休後解釋，鍾錦麟接受警方會面時表示不肯定他電話的密碼，雖然他提供了一些密碼組合，但若輸入錯誤便可能令電話資料全數刪除，故警方沒有冒險嘗試，但上周六（22日）終成功破解，林卓廷聞言笑着重複「last saturday」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬並指，已於午休時向辯方披露相關電子材料，並附有搜查令，理解當中包括200多則新訊息，而控方不會依賴任何新材料。李運騰指，相信辯方亦需時在證人作供前審視新材料，此做法較公平。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指收到逾2千whatsapp訊息-需時檢視申押周五續審&quot;&gt;辯方指收到逾2千WhatsApp訊息 需時檢視申押周五續審&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大律師沈士文其後稱，於午休時收到逾2,400則 WhatsApp 訊息，亦有很多附件，辯方需時審視，望押至周五續審。萬德豪回應，新披露訊息中有九成已被趙家賢的手機資料涵蓋，因來自同一群組。李運騰指，辯方需小心比較才能決定，他們檢視資料後，有可能要重新傳召區諾軒和趙家賢，故容讓辯方有足夠時間考慮很重要。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉終決定，將案件押至明早續審，若辯方需更多時間可再提出。代表鄒家成的大律師陳世傑指，新資料是電子版本，未能給予還柙中的當事人，或需更多時間，陳慶偉同樣着明天再處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;盤問曾稱只出席首次會議-趙覆問下確認曾兩次出席港島會議&quot;&gt;盤問曾稱只出席首次會議 趙覆問下確認曾兩次出席港島會議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方上午完成對趙家賢的盤問，並由主控萬德豪進行覆問。就出席的港島區協調會議次數，趙於主問曾稱出席了首兩次，惟接受盤問時稱只曾出席首次。萬德豪指，事發於近3年前，亦不是記憶測試，展示 WhatsApp 訊息向趙澄清。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙確認，在3月26日首次港島會議當晚近8時，曾向黎敬輝指「Ok, coming」，又着黎為他記錄重點，確認他有出席首次會議。李運騰一度問，晚上約10時趙曾發出4個表情符號，包括揮手圖案，問是什麼意思，趙邊揮手邊說：「即係喂喂喂喂我叫緊你咁解」，解釋當晚開會後與黎敬輝於附近用膳，黎一度走開，他遂問他在哪裡，同意當時會議已結束。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於4月17日第二次會議，趙確認黎當晚向他發訊息問港島區是否照開會，而翌日趙要求戴耀廷將與會者的名單發送給他，因他不認得部份人。萬問趙是否記得自己有否出席第二次會議，趙確認有，指「去咗可能睇到有啲人樣，唔係好認知邊個」，故叫戴將名單傳給他。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙更正傳統民主派對否決財案僅表關注顧慮非反對指司馬文反對後無參與初選&quot;&gt;趙更正傳統民主派對否決財案僅表「關注顧慮」非反對、指司馬文反對後無參與初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，早前趙稱曾於會後與楊雪盈通電話，楊稱戴耀廷有很多想法並「由佢講」，認為參選人當選後可有自主權。萬問這通電話是何時發生，趙表示起碼是開了一次協調會議之後才聯絡，因楊當時是18區會議民主派的輪任召集人，而民動當時同意提供秘書處服務，因此與楊有很多溝通。萬追問通話是否在第一次會議後、第二次會議前發生，趙表示「抱歉主控，我淨係記得起碼肯定係第一次會議之後」，指他們傾談上述工作時，有談及戴耀廷的倡議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/cXbSY3L.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
▲ 楊雪盈&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬另問到，趙早前在2021年7月21日進行的第二次警誡錄影會面中，表示傳統民主派「反對否決財政預算案」，趙當時稱「反對」一詞應改為表達「關注和顧慮」。趙今確認說法，並解釋做法是「要釐清我當時嘅 perception（認知）係唔係好準確嘅」，因此要更正「反對」這個字眼。他又解釋有此理解是因為與司馬文的說法相比，司馬文當時在協調會上清楚講明「反對否決財政預算案」，並因應之後發展無參與初選及官方選舉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指何桂藍於鄒家成熱烈討論時提到將立會變抗爭陣地稱民主黨代表屬少數&quot;&gt;趙指何桂藍於鄒家成熱烈討論時提到將立會變「抗爭陣地」、稱民主黨代表屬少數&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續指，趙早前指何桂藍曾提及望將立法會變成「抗爭陣地」，將制度「推到盡」，問是什麼時候聽到何這樣說？趙稱是在協調會議。趙早前指，因他會上已聽到相關訊息，故着助手黎敬輝無需記錄；而他亦曾指在新東首次會議，鄒家成和莊榮輝有熱烈討論（heated exchange）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬續問，那何桂藍的話是在該討論之前抑或之後發生？趙指，何的說法亦是包含在該「熱烈討論（heated exchange）」之內，「咁所以我就係同返黎敬輝講，呢個我都睇到啦，所以佢就唔使記低」，並指要補充「其實係佢（黎敬輝）主動問我，因為嗰 part 真係太多人講嘢，要花好多時間記錄，所以佢咁樣問我」，鄒家成皺眉。李運騰指，故熱烈的討論是在不同人之間，而不止是鄒家成和莊榮輝？趙同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙早前供稱，約有30人出席首次新東會議，陳慶偉問，那莊是屬於少數嗎？趙指「我觀察嘅形勢係相對 minority（少數）」，並指會上有超過一半本土抗爭派，鄒家成搖頭。陳再指，趙亦提及民主動力在會上亦被挑戰，趙同意，強調因為「民主動力成日畀本土抗爭派攻擊係傳統民主派嘅大台，想控制所有嘢咁樣」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2023, the Centre for Financial Crime and Security Studies at RUSI convened a roundtable in partnership with the Latvian Institute of International Affairs in Riga. The discussion, held under the Chatham House Rule, gathered representatives from government ministries and agencies, and the private sector – including banking institutions, law firms and consulting companies. The roundtable was hosted by the Financial Intelligence Unit of Latvia. The event is part of RUSI’s ongoing study of EU sanctions implementation and wider responses to illicit finance (Euro SIFMANet), funded by the National Endowment for Democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roundtable discussion opened by finding a consensus on how well prepared Latvia was for the sanctions. Representatives from the FIU Latvia described how in the past several years, Latvia has undergone a significant overhaul of its national Anti-Money Laundering, Countering the Financing of Terrorism and Proliferation Finance (AML/CFT/CPF) system, and its risk exposure to these threats has been at the top of the political and executive agenda. The process included rigorous transformations under the eye of the Financial Action Task Force and Moneyval’s International Co-operation and Review Group (ICRG) process. Through this process, Latvia worked to embed a high level of AML/CFT/CPF risk understanding and capacity by amending existing laws and supplementing them to comply with FATF Recommendations and enforcement measures, such as increasing the criminalisation of money laundering and predicate crimes (including ‘violation’ of sanctions), and setting up new institutional arrangements, such as a specialised Economic Affairs Court. Supervisors such as the Central Bank (Bank of Latvia) and the Financial and Capital Markets Commission worked to significantly improve guidance and feedback loops with supervised entities, and bolster internal control systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative from Latvia’s Central Bank noted that the reforms ensured that the financial sector was ‘combat-trained’ for the implementation of the Russia restrictive measures regime following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Latvia built its current sanctions regime based on its experience with the post-2014 Crimean, Belarusian and Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions. A representative from the Latvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) described how the MFA created a sanctions division as a result of the Moneyval process, ensuring that sanctions were already front-and-centre in policy discussions at the time of the Russian invasion in 2022. The guidance and training that Latvia received throughout the ICRG process and from partners such as OFAC strengthened Latvia’s system to the point that it is now itself providing training to other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latvian authorities described the national sanctions implementation framework as highly decentralised, with multiple agencies sharing a wide range of responsibilities. Despite the challenges posed by this decentralised system, participants agreed that the sanctions regime has been effective, in large part due to the financial sector reform of the previous few years. Violation of sanctions (both of EU and UN sanctions) is a criminal offence in Latvia, the sanctioned person and entity list is publicly available, and regular public–private collaboration ensures everyone is on the same page. In 2022, Latvian banks identified 35 entities linked to sanctioned entities or persons and froze more than €80 million. FIU Latvia received around 300 STRs, mostly linked to the evasion of sectoral sanctions. Supervisors have also conducted on-site inspections to ensure effective compliance. Tax and customs police initiated 114 criminal proceedings in relation to sanctions violation. The four major Latvian banks have stopped executing transactions to and from Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;latvias-challenges&quot;&gt;Latvia’s Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative of the financial sector association, Finance Latvia, noted two main challenges. The first major challenge of sanctions stems mainly from a lack of cross-border harmonisation on legislation and implementation. How the issue of ‘control’ over an entity is identified in different countries often varies, creating confusion in handling activities that may be deemed sanctions evasion. A further issue cited by the private sector was the challenge of how to treat the risk from Russian sanctions targets using Central Asian countries for evasion and circumvention, ‘contaminating’ business dealings in that region. In addition, private sector actors pointed to the lack of sanctions-evasion prevention capacity in corporate sectors subject to sectoral sanctions. A shortage of sanctions expertise has limited the ability of these industries to raise their capabilities. Finance Latvia explained their ongoing trainings and seminars with their members’ clients, but it is difficult to make them catch up and build capacity for a capability that the financial sector has been engaged in since even before 2014. With this lack of capacity in mind, while it is important to ensure a rapid build-up of implementation capacity, the application of this capacity should be monitored, in order to prevent a cascade of de-risking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative from the Customs Authority highlighted that the main challenge is not in the checking of goods but checking the connections between persons. The Latvian border is naturally at a high risk of exposure to organised crime and drug and alcohol trafficking. The monitoring process is further complicated by the number of exceptions in the customs and trade sanctions regimes, together with the tendency for transporters to use double sets of documentation that hide the legitimate destination of goods and get swapped once they cross the border to obfuscate trade between Russia, Central Asia and Latvia. In general, the customs representative highlighted that more could be done by the EU in this regard. For example, FRONTEX provides funds and support for building capacity to address people crossing the EU’s external borders, but not goods. Participants made a strong argument that as Latvia is among the few member states with direct exposure to Russia via a common border, more resources should be concentrated there to prevent sanctions breaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The representatives of the Employers Confederation emphasised that, in general, communication from the Latvian government has been very effective. However, they highlighted their experience with the overburdened systems of compliance of sanctions implementation, noting that members have repeatedly experienced funds getting seriously delayed in transactions with Central Asian counterparties. Participants found that more institutional collaboration between Latvia and Central Asia could result in better understanding of risks from this region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a clear consensus among participants about the additional difficulty stemming from Latvia’s close geographical proximity to Russia and Belarus. Certain designated entities had a substantial economic presence in Latvia, generating doubts about the best way to proceed with paying salaries, taxes or the continuity of economic activity generally. These payment complications have resulted in a trend of Latvian businesses trying to find banking options outside Latvia (notably in Lithuania), making oversight even more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants from both public and private sectors noted on multiple occasions that effective sanctions compliance in Latvia was possible for numerous reasons, but that continued access to the Ultimate Beneficial Owner (UBO) Registry is an important one. The Registry started conducting analysis of ownership to support banks and businesses in complying with sanctions. The new power they received led the Registry to become a form of analytical centre in support of sanctions implementation. Unlike many other EU countries where beneficial ownership registries have been closed to public access as a result of a ruling by the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) in 2022, in Latvia, the government has been able to keep the Registry open. Latvia is one of the most open countries in the world regarding the availability of UBO data to the public and does not solely base its national legal framework on the legal norm currently repealed by the judgment of the CJEU. The Latvian framework was established before the 5th Directive came into force and had already assessed the balance of data privacy and public disclosure within the scope of other normative acts. As SIFMANet has found in other countries where registries have been closed, such action significantly complicates and impairs the effectiveness of sanctions implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, as sanctions become more sophisticated, the roundtable reached a consensus that the highly decentralised model followed by Latvia can be improved. FIU Latvia described the centralisation effort underway, via a newly designed body, to try to remedy this issue, and build a faster and more reliable feedback loop between the public and private sectors. The aim of this effort is to coordinate approaches and hold singular decision-making power, making it possible to support affected entities and make quick and effective judgements where necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latvian authorities also found the need for centralisation to be a key element at the EU level. The challenges posed by the current lack of harmonisation in the EU must be addressed. While sanctions evasion is a crime in Latvia, it is not wholly criminalised in the EU, resulting in different levels of prioritisation in sanctions evasion prevention among partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, participants also agreed that the current state of beneficial ownership registries in the EU needs to be remedied. Registries must include accurate, up-to-date and accessible data. Although open registries should be the goal, even countries with an open and accessible registry (for example, the UK) suffer from unreliability because their data is unverified and therefore untrustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, though the role of Latvia as a gateway of financial flows eastward has been largely restricted, trade between Latvia and its neighbours continues. Representatives from the public and private sectors asserted that resources and staffing must continue to be dedicated to ensuring compliance with sanctions; and more international collaboration will be required to bolster the strength of the Latvian and Baltic borders, as this is also the main external border of the EU with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there was consensus at the roundtable that the European Commission must communicate more thoroughly with the private sector in regard to sectoral sanctions, otherwise this duty of informing businesses in the EU falls solely on the financial sector, which may not be best equipped to carry this burden alone. In this sense, participants agreed that the EU and national competent authorities should engage more with the private sector during the design of sanctions and immediately following their publication, to ensure that the desired measures are effectively implemented by the relevant sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;趙家賢改稱陳志全沒有出席新東協調會 指助手認錯人&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/QmwKPCz.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（24日）踏入審訊第49天。趙家賢上周五供稱陳志全有出席首次新東協調會議，辯方播放陳於同一時間主持網台節目的片段質疑趙記錯，惟趙強調記得陳與助理有現身會議場地，對辯方提問「no comment」。趙今主動補充，稱經過多次回想，記得陳的助理蘇浩會上曾稱陳志全要做網台直播未能出席，故確認陳並無出席該次會議；而對其助手黎敬輝筆記稱陳志全有出席，趙解釋蘇浩身旁有一個「形態好似陳志全」的男子，故黎「應該係搞錯咗」、「認錯咗人」而寫錯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙在盤問下亦同意，戴耀廷就共同綱領刻意不用「必定運用」否決權的字眼，以免有「白紙黑字」令參選人被DQ，而「積極運用」或「會運用」字眼均是留討論空間讓參選人自行決定。此外，法官今甫開庭提醒在法庭發表政見屬「藐視法庭」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;法官陳慶偉甫開庭稱若在法庭發表政見是藐視法庭&quot;&gt;法官陳慶偉甫開庭稱若在法庭發表政見是藐視法庭&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉今甫開庭便嚴肅表示：「這裡是法庭，只處理法律議題，無論你政治理念如何，這也不是用來發表政見的場所。」他又指，絕對不反對在法庭以外表達政見，但若任何人有意或嘗試在法庭發表他們的政見，便是「藐視法庭」，「你會由我本人親自處理。」陳發言後被告一臉茫然，有人互相討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;上周稱陳志全有出席新東首次會議-趙今主動作補充&quot;&gt;上周稱陳志全有出席新東首次會議 趙今主動作補充&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢其後入庭繼續接受盤問。代表陳志全的大律師馬維騉先向他說早晨，趙亦說「早晨馬大狀」，其後舉手說：「想問吓呢係唔好意思，我記得你上星期話如果我有回想到一啲情況，都可以照向你作答係咪？」馬表示不記得在什麼情況他有這樣提過，但問趙是否有話想說，惟法官陳慶偉打斷，着馬直接問問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙在盤問下表示，沒有出席6月28日的新界東論壇，而他7月12日的初選投票日傍晚曾到新界東票站，但沒有看見陳志全。馬維騉再指，從2020年到趙被捕，除了第一次新東會議外，馬是否從沒與陳面對面交談？趙同意，並指他就是想就「新界東第一次會議陳志全是否出席嗰個問題」作補充。趙家賢上周曾稱陳志全有出席4月14日的首次新東會議，惟辯方播放陳同時段主持網台節目的片段，質疑趙記錯，趙則堅稱有回想到陳在教協會議室坐在助手蘇浩身旁的畫面，對辯方說法「no comment」，又對辯方稱陳兩次會議均無出席指「我只能夠答不同意」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;上周稱對蘇浩發言無印象-趙今稱蘇曾提及陳志全要做網台直播無法出席&quot;&gt;上周稱對蘇浩發言無印象 趙今稱蘇曾提及陳志全要做網台直播無法出席&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙今指，「我多次嘅回想返呢」，當日下的士後，「就買咗幾支茶」上教協會址開會，約8時到達，到場後助手黎敬輝為他預留身旁的位置。趙指雖然會議寫明7時開始，但實際上約7時半才開始，「都有好多人未到齊」，而他坐下準備拿電腦出來時，黎就向他交代當時情況，稱戴耀廷開場介紹協調和初選背景後，就讓在場團隊和參選人介紹自己，而趙到達時「仲係啲人士團隊介紹自己嘅時候」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，他剛坐下就將幾樽茶「行去拎畀戴耀廷同區諾軒，亦都畀咗一支我助手」，而助手「飲咗兩啖」後就稱要去洗手間，「還掂你到咗，你會唔會可以幫我睇住先」，陳志全、林卓廷、鄒家成、吳政亨等多人發笑。趙續指，黎去洗手間後，蘇浩發言介紹自己是人民力量執委，提及人民力量支持協調和會參與初選，並提到因為陳志全「有網台直播要做」，故「出席唔到」，向在座各位致歉，並特別提及「希望之後嘅會議可唔可以改唔係星期二嘅時間」。此時陳志全皺眉，林卓廷亦笑着搖頭。惟趙家賢上周五稱對陳志全和蘇浩發言沒有印象。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙確認陳志全首次新東會議不在場-指有男性形態似陳-助手認錯人致紀錄有錯&quot;&gt;趙確認陳志全首次新東會議不在場 指有男性形態似陳 助手認錯人致紀錄有錯&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙指，這是他所記得會面的情況，而翌日他收到助手筆記，看到寫有陳志全出席，「我就嗰陣時候有問返佢，咦，陳志全係咪有出席呀咁樣」，並指「因為我係早走咗，咁所以我唔知道係咪我離開咗之後陳志全有出席到」，而黎則回應「咦唔係，陳志全一開始咪坐咗喺蘇浩隔離囉」，林卓廷說「吓」，陳志全亦笑到全身震動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/cFflhi6.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 陳志全&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，「咁我記得蘇浩隔離係有一個男性，不過形態係好似陳志全咁」，林卓廷大聲說「哇」，陳志全亦皺眉發笑。在延伸庭的吳敏兒發笑，黃之鋒則「O嘴」。趙續說，「咁因應蘇浩嘅講法同埋我助手嘅講法，咁我確認陳志全係當時不在會議」，林卓廷說「吓？」，趙再說：「因為我助手應該係搞錯咗嗰個人，佢以為係陳志全」，因而在筆記寫上陳志全和蘇浩二人出席，林再說：「唔係呀？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬問，故是黎敬輝弄錯了？趙指「我確認佢唔係嗰個紀錄佢有搞錯，係因為佢認錯咗人而導致個紀錄寫錯」，馬指這正是他的意思。馬其後再問，故趙確認陳志全沒有出席？惟法官認為趙家賢已清楚回答，着辯方問其他問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指陳志全沒有提交政綱-趙同意無看過其政綱&quot;&gt;辯方指陳志全沒有提交政綱 趙同意無看過其政綱&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙其後確認，在整個2020年到他被捕，從沒有面對面或透過電話與陳志全交談，亦沒有以 WhatsApp 與陳有私人的聯絡。馬續展示陳的提名表格，指陳沒有附上任何政綱。趙指根據表格上職員的寫法，陳的政綱是於6月22日才補交。馬問趙知道陳有補交文件嗎？趙指只是綜合性聽到職員指各區都收齊文件，但職員沒特別講明陳有沒有交，而趙沒有見過陳的政綱，亦不記得其政綱內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;選舉按金收據顯示由黎敬輝於6月19日簽發，法官李運騰指出提名表格簽署的日期是6月20日，問提名表格和其他文件會於不同時間繳交嗎？趙指根據職員的標示，相信表格一定是於6月19日下午收到，而表格可能由陳志全預先簽署並填上日期，再交職員幫手報名，故日期有出入。他再同意，在整個初選過程中，「就算我有睇民主動力嘅文件，我都冇睇到陳志全嘅方格表同政綱。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱5至6名兼職職員有民動fb帳戶密碼並可登入&quot;&gt;趙稱5至6名兼職職員有民動FB帳戶密碼、並可登入&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉其後就民主動力及趙家賢的個人 Facebook 提問。趙確認案發時民主動力只有一個 Facebook 帳戶，而除了他及總幹事黎敬輝，約有5至6名兼職職員擁有密碼，並可登入有關帳戶。馬問登入 Facebook 帳戶是否只需一個密碼，並指「這可能是一個愚蠢的問題」，趙思考了一會仍未有作答，馬隨即問：「我這個問題是否太愚蠢？」，旁聽席傳來笑聲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙指他未能回答，因他是透過電話上 Facebook，登入後就長期可以登入，亦很久沒有透過電腦登入，故只能說民主動力 Facebook 創立時應只用一組密碼就可登入。馬其後問民動副召集人鍾錦麟有沒有密碼，法官陳仲衡打斷指這要問鍾。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱職員可發帖或改動內容-非不受控制-但有時太忙未必經他檢視下發帖&quot;&gt;趙稱職員可發帖或改動內容 非不受控制 但有時太忙未必經他檢視下發帖&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉續問，是否該些人士可以隨意進入民主動力 Facebook 發布和轉發任何內容，趙同意，指據黎敬輝稱兼職職員有此權限。法官陳慶偉續問，最極端的例子，他們可否發表與民動政治理念相違背的想法？趙表示：「如果冇特別睇嗰個帖文，佢哋（兼職職員）有時都會按需要擺嘢上去。」陳追問他們是否不受任何控制，趙稱：「呢個唔係嘅」，並解釋因為其工作量，「未必係我或者我嘅總幹事能夠睇住或者處理」，因此他與總幹事會向職員講解訊息方向，並由他們處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬續展示趙家賢在無損權益口供中的內容，他曾表示民主動力登入密碼有多人知道，包括他、黎敬輝及部分活動團隊職員，由趙授權他們處理 Facebook，趙並會就發帖制定方向，授權秘書處發帖，趙指「我會盡量在發出前先檢視。但有時太忙，會授權同事未經本人檢視下發帖。」趙確認該說法，並確認自己有兩個個人 Facebook 帳戶，而其職員擁有密碼，並獲授權處理該兩個帳戶。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;民主動力轉發朱凱廸回應譚耀宗帖文-稱立會過半觸憲政危機-趙稱助手建議轉發&quot;&gt;民主動力轉發朱凱廸回應譚耀宗帖文 稱立會過半觸憲政危機 趙稱助手建議轉發&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後展示民主動力在2020年3月27日的 Facebook 帖文，轉發同案被告朱凱廸對《香港01》 〈【基本法30年】譚耀宗：倘泛民議會過半觸發憲政危機 中央勢出手〉一文的回應，趙同意當時批准發布該帖文。趙同意，譚耀宗是全國人大常委，指「佢喺建制派有足夠嘅政治份量去解讀一啲中央嘅政治政策同訊息」。馬一度問全國人大常委是否獲授權解釋《基本法》的權力，惟陳慶偉指嚴格來說是不正確的，指人大常委並非由中央政府賦權釋法，而是由《中華人民共和國憲法》賦權，又指與普通法系統不同。趙同意指國家憲法授權全國人大和全國人大常委解釋法律。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬又一度問《香港01》是否可靠的媒體，趙指「回應法官閣下，我首先要講吓我對新聞嘅解讀」，林卓廷說「嘩」。法官陳仲衡問其答案是否長，趙笑言「好短㗎咋」，鄒家成搖頭擺手。李運騰追問是否需要，馬說不，多人大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱無印象3月尾有人說初選違法&quot;&gt;趙稱無印象3月尾有人說初選違法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬續指，譚耀宗提及民主派議會過半會觸發憲政危機，中央會有辦法應對，而朱凱廸則作出回應。趙主動補充，由於戴耀廷3月26日的記者會民主動力「完全冇獲邀請」、「完全被排除在外」，而當時知道朱凱廸帖文有談及記者會發言的綜合訊息，故決定轉發，惟陳慶偉打斷指與問題無關。馬續指，為何會在所有帖文中選擇轉發朱凱廸的帖文？趙回應，是由助手找到帖文和作建議，認為朱凱廸有談及會上意見，「轉發嘅話就令公眾印象覺得民主動力喺呢件事有參與咁樣」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，雖然當時有份量的建制派指初選或觸發憲政危機，但沒有提及初選的合法性問題？李運騰改問，即直至2020年3月底，趙知道香港社會有人說初選可能違法嗎？趙表示：「回應李運騰法官閣下，我冇乜印象，因為嗰時民主動力係如火如荼咁推緊選民登記個計劃。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱錄第二份口供時知道正向控方提供證據-但不確定需否上庭&quot;&gt;趙稱錄第二份口供時知道正向控方提供證據 但不確定需否上庭&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬其後展示趙家賢於今年1月10日錄取的第二份「無損權益口供（NPS）」，問他當時是否已知自己會被傳召為控方證人，趙思考一會後表示，他做第一份NPS時，知道情況是「就住之後嗰個案件向控方同法庭提供資料，而有需要嘅話係需要出庭作證。但係有可能之後覺得我嘅供詞、我嘅資料係冇乜幫助嘅話呢，就可能無需要做證」。李運騰續問，他在錄取第二份供詞時，是否還未決定成為控方證人或在法庭作供，趙回應：「我知道我係幫手畀緊證供、畀緊證據，但係咪要上庭，呢個就未確定。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙確認積極運用或會運用留空間讓參選人決定刻意不用必定運用&quot;&gt;趙確認「積極運用」或「會運用」留空間讓參選人決定、刻意不用「必定運用」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬續引述書面供詞，提及「戴耀廷認為交由各個選區的協調會討論『積極』或是『會』『運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案』較為恰當。不論寫『積極運用』或是『會運用』都無損共同綱領嘅內容，唔同用字只係想留番討論空間俾參選人自行決定」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙確認，會上曾討論運用否決權的字眼，而不論用什麼字眼，戴也是想留空間讓參選人自行決定，並指因此民主動力在製作提名表格時，會如「九二共識」，「一個中國，各自表述」，「本身個思維都係唔同嘅字眼，等大家按佢哋嘅需要交代而去揀選」，但同意不論使用哪一字眼，都不會影響共同綱領的內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙亦在供詞提到，「（戴認為）唔清楚寫成『必定運用基本法賦予立法會權力去否決財政預算案』就可以規避責任，有助參選人免卻被選舉主任取消參選資格」，趙盤問下同意戴是刻意不使用「必定運用」字眼，「意思係唔好寫到死、有啲白紙黑字嘅嘢，到候選人報名參選時有啲枝節麻煩嘅嘢發生」。馬最後問，「積極使用」、「會運用」兩者的意思均不等於「必定運用」？趙表示：「我諗從一個一般常人嘅解讀，呢3個應該有唔同嘅程度喺度。」馬維騉續表示盤問完畢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/TX9a0G9.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（24日）踏入審訊第49天。趙家賢接受代表鄒家成的大狀盤問，就新東首次會議的情況，辯方指會上無就運用否決權討論，而鄒家成亦沒有說「要用盡方法去迫政府回應五大訴求」。惟趙不同意，強調親眼目睹鄒家成和民主黨代表莊榮輝就否決預算案「直情企咗起身」討論，而其助手筆記無記錄相關情況，是因「我睇住成個片段喺我腦海度」，想助手「慳功夫」，故着他「呢 part 唔使寫」。趙又一度模仿莊榮輝激動稱：「難道起醫院起學校都要反對呀？」，指當時「直情係有啲情緒」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，繼早上主動改稱陳志全無出席新東首次會議，趙下午突然再主動補充，指細心回想後，記起鄭達鴻和彭卓棋應在2020年6月底《國安法》將頒布時，曾分別提出刪除政綱和將政綱改為留白。此前辯方就此提問時，趙均稱沒有印象。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙早前指不記得鄭達鴻有否改政綱-今主動稱記起公民黨要求delete&quot;&gt;趙早前指不記得鄭達鴻有否改政綱 今主動稱記起公民黨要求「delete」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表陳志全的大狀馬維騉早上完成盤問，趙家賢下午主動表示，希望就辯方早前的提問作補充：「法官閣下抱歉，我知道我喺法庭要就我所知盡量回應，就之前兩位大律師兩個事項嘅提問呢，我細心回想到一啲訊息」。他亦對可能打亂流程表示抱歉，「所以我係想請示法官閣下應該係點處理」，林卓廷發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指示他可作補充，趙續指是有關鄭達鴻和彭卓棋代表大狀就選舉政綱的問題。代表鄭達鴻的大律師黃宇逸盤問時曾提及，公民黨在《國安法》後曾要求將政綱修訂為「無字政綱」，惟趙稱沒有印象。趙今表示，自己當時「真係諗唔起任何嘢」，但現在回想，記得助手當時曾向他表示：「公民黨佢哋嗰面呢，係就住佢哋幾位候選人嘅政綱係想更新嘅」，並指他們因知道國內已制定《國安法》 ，但尚未在港通過，由於「唔想有一啲咬文嚼字，過唔到選舉主任」，故就選舉政綱作出更正，並「delete 咗整個選舉政綱」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙記起職員稱赤柱區議員想將政綱改為留白-回想起是彭卓棋&quot;&gt;趙記起職員稱赤柱區議員想將政綱改為留白 回想起是彭卓棋&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於彭卓棋代表大律師盧敏儀提及，彭曾向民動職員「Christy」提出要移除全部政綱，趙盤問下同樣稱沒有印象。趙今解釋「我當時都係即時無任何特別回憶喺當中」，但「細心回想返呢，我就記得我兼職職員 Christy 有同我講過話，『赤柱嗰個』政綱有啲嘢想改」，並指「個改法係成個留空白」，問趙應如何處理，趙當時吩咐「咁就照跟佢意思去做啦」。趙續指，當時職員沒有講明是彭卓棋，但之後回想才記起彭卓棋是時任赤柱區議員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/8cvFRxl.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱兩人應是6月底要求收回政綱-當時有消息指已通過國安法&quot;&gt;趙稱兩人應是6月底要求收回政綱 當時有消息指已通過《國安法》&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問到是甚麼時候發生，趙表示一定是初選投票日之前的事。陳仲衡追問是2020年7月1日前還是後，趙稱現在推敲應該是6月底，因為當時收到消息指已通過《國安法》，但尚未頒佈條文。趙確認鄭達鴻及彭卓棋均為港島區候選人，李運騰問修改政綱是發生在6月27日港島選舉論壇前還是後？趙表示：「抱歉法官閣下，我未能夠作答到，因為選舉論壇唔係我負責。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉問兩人是否想收回選舉政綱，趙表示：「從佢哋嘅做法係嘅。」大律師黃宇逸續表示希望保留盤問，因需向其當事人索取指示。惟陳慶偉指，不希望不斷有不同律師進行盤問，若趙明天又有新事項補充，事情就會沒完沒了，着黃宇逸如有其他問題想問，可找其他律師幫忙。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指新東首次會議無討論否決權鄒家成無提用盡方法逼政府-趙不同意&quot;&gt;辯方指新東首次會議無討論否決權、鄒家成無提用盡方法逼政府 趙不同意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢其後接受代表鄒家成的大律師陳世傑盤問。趙確認有兩次新東會議，他只曾出席4月14日的首次會議並遲到早退，會上亦忙於以電腦處理區議會事務。趙並曾供稱，戴在該次會議提倡「會積極運用」基本法權力否決預算案，會上討論有「火花」，鄒家成曾稱「要用盡方法去迫政府回應五大訴求」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑指出，當日會上從來沒有出現「會積極運用」否決權的討論，而鄒家成亦沒有說過該句話，惟趙均不同意。陳續指，趙會上專注力一半半（half-hearted），需依賴助手筆記協助記憶發生的事，趙同意，指「喺嗰啲我冇特別留心聽嘅議題上面係」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙同意首次新東會議主要討論應否有共同綱領&quot;&gt;趙同意首次新東會議主要討論應否有共同綱領&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑續展示黎敬輝就首次會議的筆記，提及李永成，問趙記得李永成在場嗎？法官李運騰改問沒有筆記的話，趙有否任何獨立記憶李在場？趙靜默多時答：「而家冇嘅」。陳續展示筆記，指當日會上曾討論不同議題，主要是共同綱領，其中吳文遠提到「大家可制訂共同綱領」、將軍澳青年力量稱「必須有共同綱領」，何桂藍亦稱「必須有約束力初選」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳問，趙是否記得這是會上主要（predominantly）討論的議題？趙同意，並指會上有討論是否要初選、對初選的不同意見，及應該要有大家都同意的綱領等。李運騰問，討論是關於應否有共同綱領，抑或如有共同綱領，應包括什麼內容？趙指「兩方面都有討論，不過前者係多啲」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指筆記只曾提一次否決權-趙稱是助手就會上重點綜合寫咗落嚟&quot;&gt;辯方指筆記只曾提一次否決權 趙稱是助手就會上重點「綜合寫咗落嚟」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續展示黎敬輝筆記，提及鄒家成指「認同初選排位，民調最後決定或只以民調決定」，指鄒並非談及否決權，而是排名制度，趙指「喺呢句嘅記錄，係」。陳續問是否與趙的記憶相符？趙指排位制度與初選如何揀選最多人支持的候選人有關，當時會上有討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，根據筆記，共同綱領和否決權只曾被一併談及一次，而且是由戴耀廷提出，即「共同綱領原則是否決財政預算案，迫政府解散立法會，今次任期可能只有7個月」。趙同意，「個筆記就咁展示，就咁睇，係」，但指其助手是就會上重點「綜合咁寫咗落嚟」。李運騰問是助手綜合會上每人所說的重點，抑或是戴耀廷綜合與會者的說法，趙指「兩樣都有」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指目睹鄒家成和民主黨莊榮輝企起身討論-故着助手無需記錄&quot;&gt;趙指目睹鄒家成和民主黨莊榮輝「企起身」討論 故着助手無需記錄&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，事實上趙並不知道，因這是黎敬輝的紀錄，而趙沒有告訴他怎樣記錄。趙重申他於會議早走前，坐在黎身旁，而提到戴耀廷就否決預算案的倡議時，整個討論有「火花」，「嗰個位因為我睇住，所以我就叫咗我助手呢 part 唔使寫啦」，鄒家成皺眉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳問趙為何要這樣說？是想要在紀錄隱瞞什麼嗎？趙重申之前被其他大狀問及時也有表示：「橫掂我自己都聽咗、睇住個情況，莊榮輝同鄒家成直情企咗起身，我睇住成個片段喺我腦海度，我想職員慳返啲功夫，呢 part 就唔使佢寫啦」，鄒家成一臉驚訝和皺眉，再與林卓廷相視而笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，趙稱鄒家成和莊榮輝「企咗起身」，是「比喻」抑或他們真的有這樣做？趙指「法官閣下唔係比喻，係我直情見住⋯直情係有啲情緒」，他一度雙手張開發出急促的聲音，林卓廷和法庭傳譯即問：「咩話？」趙續稱：「好記得莊榮輝嗰句，『難道起醫院起學校都要反對呀？』，就企咗起身」，說時刻意提高聲調模仿另一人腔調，鄒家成發笑，趙同意法官陳仲衡指有熾熱的討論。陳再指會上沒提及否決預算案，惟陳慶偉指可留待陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙同意筆記顯示第二次會議有重點討論否決預算案&quot;&gt;趙同意筆記顯示第二次會議有重點討論否決預算案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於5月5日的第二次會議，趙並無出席，但確認有看過黎敬輝的筆記，事後亦從黎和戴耀廷了解會上情況。趙同意根據筆記，會上有重點（prominently）討論否決預算案的議題，其中沙田區議會主席程張迎曾提及「否決預算案是由 CP（公民黨）提出」，另「豐」表示「CP 對，不能迴避否決預算案的方向」。趙確認公民黨於3月開記者會提及否決財案，而「豐」是公民黨的高級職員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑又問，筆記提及的「文遠」（吳文遠）是否來自社民連，趙同意並指：「文遠係一個人嚟嘅，代表社民連。」趙同意根據紀錄，吳文遠曾稱：「有些功能組別民主派參選人，可能對否決 budget 猶豫，可能需中間落墨，要佢哋參與機制，就算不需初選」，而李永成曾稱：「應該以入閘為目標，策略上不要太突出，故不贊成初選時已表明否決預算案。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙同意會上否決財案備受討論-有贊成和保留兩種意見&quot;&gt;趙同意會上否決財案備受討論 有贊成和保留兩種意見&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳問到，筆記是否顯示就否決財政預算案，會上明顯至少有贊成和保留兩種不同意見，趙同意指：「根據我助手整理嘅筆記，係。」李運騰問，那除了助手的筆記，根據他從黎和戴的印象，當日會議是否就否決預算案有很多討論（much debated topic）？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙未有直接回答，僅表示「個時間重點係擺喺嗰度多啲」，因很多區快將達成協議和將舉行初選，因此戴耀廷認為「有個時間性，希望可以攞到共識」。李運騰打斷，提醒趙聽清楚問題再回答，指這十分重要，並重複再問當天會上，否決預算案是否備受討論，趙同意但補充：「我唔知個討論氣氛去到點。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉再打斷，強調不是問他會上的氣氛，並指李運騰問了「非常簡單」的問題。李運騰和陳慶偉最後再問，根據筆記和趙與二人的對話，當天會上否決預算案是否一個備受討論的議題？趙思考數秒後回答：「係，冇錯。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明天續審，陳世傑會繼續盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（21日）踏入審訊第48天。代表何桂藍的大狀今繼續質疑趙家賢可信性，指其供詞等無提及民動於2020年5月才獲邀承辦初選，民動實早於3月已承辦。趙極不同意，反指辯方「咬文嚼字」；並指警方供詞僅就案情「大方向」作記錄，民動何時承辦並非重點，又主動提及何桂藍在新東協調會議上曾提及望立會變成「抗爭陣地」，引致「中港關係破局」。被問作供時是否將自己表現（put forward）得溫和，趙激動回答：「I’m not put myself forward, I just told the fact.」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙又表示不同意戴耀廷提倡的「大殺傷力憲制武器」，辯方質疑與他選擇認罪不符，又質疑趙作供時嘗試將自己的參與講到最低，並怪責和誇大他人參與以換取較輕刑期。趙不同意，指「我有責任係去協助作證」，向法庭講述他所知的情況，惟在法官追問下同意知道認罪和任控方證人有可能換取減刑，但「冇 guarantee 嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢供詞曾稱留意到初選可能犯法-但身不由己故無退出&quot;&gt;趙家賢供詞曾稱留意到初選可能犯法 但「身不由己」故無退出&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊昨因有被告不適而提早結束，據悉是何桂藍。何今如常入庭，精神不俗，未有配戴口罩，但不時以紙巾抹鼻涕。法官陳仲衡甫開庭便詢問何的代表大狀 Trevor Beel，指昨聽說其當事人不適，問她今天身體怎樣？Beel 指她今日到庭，相信已好轉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 昨指民主動力早於2020年2月已獲邀出席商討初選的會議，趙強調該次只是「初步交流」，民動是於5月中下旬才正式答應承辦。Beel 今再引不同文件就民動答應承辦初選的時間發問，先展示趙於2022年9月為警方錄取的首份書面供詞，提及於2020年3月尾至4月頭，區諾軒致電他指戴耀廷欲籌辦初選，區建議由民主動力幫手，故聯絡趙邀請民動協助籌辦。趙指由於2018年民動有辦立法會補選初選的經驗，亦望協助增加民主派在立法會的話語權，故「我與『民主動力』副召集人鍾錦麟商討後，決定答應邀請，協助戴耀廷籌辦初選，但負責範圍及有關初選嘅細節並無於當刻決定」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙同意，「3月尾至4月頭」應為2月，Beel 再問趙是否同意供詞所說？趙大聲湊前咪高峰說：「Disagree.」Beel 問，即供詞內容是否真實？趙指「係真實嘅，係整個事情嘅簡約版」。法官李運騰指，留意到「當刻」被譯作「on that day」，但中文亦可譯作「at that time（那時）」，即沒有指明日期，Beel 接受。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續讀出趙在2023年1月的供詞，再提及3月尾至4月頭，「當我同戴耀廷及區諾軒一開始籌備初選時」，原望協助民主派議會過半，同時推廣民動工作、「令我哋更為人熟識」，故答應帶領民動協辦初選。但隨協調工作開展，他在會上聽到戴和參選人提及入立會後否決預算案，戴4月尾亦宣傳「攬炒十步曲」，趙指雖無清楚了解，但有印象戴稱透過兩次否決財案，迫行政長官解散立法會和辭職，是「憲制武器」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，當時初選已成社會焦點，「雖然我留意到戴耀廷所講話要藉初選取得立法會控制權去否決財案有可能犯法，明白到策劃初選係有違反《國安法》或香港其他法例嘅風險，但當時我已身不由己，作為初選主辦單位之一，如果我未完成初選就退出，不但未能符合當時支持民主陣營嘅市民之期望，而且對我本人聲譽及民主動力發展上會有反效果」，故即使知道戴的最終計劃是要令特首辭職，仍繼續初選工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方質疑供詞無提5月被邀承辦初選-趙警方僅就案情大方向取資料&quot;&gt;辯方質疑供詞無提5月被邀承辦初選 趙：警方僅就案情「大方向」取資料&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問，上述段落是否真確？趙答：「全部都係整個案情嘅事實嘅一個綜合版。」Beel 指，但當中沒有提及民動在5月被邀請承辦初選？趙解釋，因警方撰寫「無損權益口供」時要就「整個案情嘅大方向去取得有關嘅資料」，而他與鍾錦麟已認罪，警方錄口供時不認為民主動力何時承辦初選是「重點」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙又指，在錄影會面有提到5月才確認承辦初選，故曾問警方指他3月尾4月頭與戴及區籌備初選，「我有同佢講依個位係咪打出嚟唔係太表達到我嘅原意呢？」，警方則解釋因當時民動雖未答應承辦初選，但有獲邀列席會議提供意見，故就案情大方向如此撰寫。趙指，「我講咗好多當時嘅資料訊息畀當時嘅警察聽」，惟在供詞中「警方都並不是將所有我講過嘅嘢寫晒落去」；他又笑言，「我相信依個法庭見證我作證，包括三位法官閣下都有時嫌我講嘢比較長氣同譖」，故警方亦是綜合處理案情的需要做紀錄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指心底裡覺得初選有問題-惟因社會氣氛葉劉及湯家驊稱初選不違法故無退出&quot;&gt;趙指心底裡覺得初選有問題 惟因社會氣氛、葉劉及湯家驊稱初選不違法故無退出&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續主動提及，以同一準則，警方也有問及他何桂藍協調會上的說話，惟 Beel 打斷指他扯得太遠。李運騰並問，趙曾於7月的記者會上稱初選不違法，但供詞卻稱初選前其實已知道有法律風險？趙指「回應法官閣下，喺我自己個人心底裡面，我係會覺得有啲問題嘅」，李問他何時開始質疑「35+計劃」的合法性？趙指是6月底7月初，而他在記者會稱初選是合法，主要是就選舉相關法例和私隱條例。趙又重申，戴當時作為法律學者表明初選不會違法，而參與的政黨有資深大律師和大律師亦「冇特別出聲」，「我只係作為法律相關服務業嘅調解員，我又點可能話依個一定係違法？」&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 前排：趙家賢（左）、戴耀廷（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李再問，但趙供詞稱意識到可能犯法，惟因不望影響其聲譽及民主動力發展才繼續，故他不是相信沒違法，而是知道違法仍被逼繼續？趙先指，警方錄口供時內容未必順序，「如果淨係睇一段嘢⋯係睇唔到我當時表達嘅全部情況。」李問那當時他的心態是怎樣？是因為怕影響個人聲譽及民主動力發展才不敢退縮？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙回答：「當時我當然有部分依個嘅思維喺度，因為嗰陣時候我心底裡面我個人係覺得其實梗係唔做好過做，因為唔去做、唔去掂嘅話就梗係完全冇任何風險啦」，惟趙指，當時已答應承辦初選，「而當時嘅社會氣氛，無論民間又好，所有政治陣營又好，係好熱切期盼個初選繼續舉行」；加上戴清楚講明沒有違法，而傳媒亦有訪問行政會議成員葉劉淑儀同湯家驊，二人均不覺得初選違法，「我心裡面係有疑問、顧慮，但當我身邊就算係建制陣營都有訊息話冇違法嘅話，所以當時好難話即刻退出。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡問，建制派是認為只是舉行初選不違法，抑或包括否決預算案令特首下台的主張？趙重申當時整個民主陣營的認知，是行政會議成員、資深大律師也說初選無違法，而民動作為初選的「服務提供者」，就民動負責的事「我唔覺得有任何違法」，故有上述看法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱何桂藍望將立會變抗爭陣地引致中港關係破局&quot;&gt;趙稱何桂藍望將立會變「抗爭陣地」、引致「中港關係破局」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡其後向 Beel 指，趙家賢曾提及何桂藍會上發言，若 Beel 不讓趙解釋，控方或會在覆問提問，意味屆時辯方不能再就此提問。Beel 續問趙家賢關於何桂藍有何想說？趙表示，警方錄口供時曾向他了解何在會上的發言，而他有憶述何「都有好特別講到佢睇法係立法會係變咗一個抗爭嘅陣地，佢就希望將立法會就用作作為中港關係嘅破局，引致到中港關係嘅破局」，此時何桂藍微微皺眉和發笑，又向律師席做口形，鄒家成則搖頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續解釋，何經常提出的「破局」，「其實係將整個制度去到推到盡，而係將本身中國同香港嘅一國兩制、整個政治制度個運作去打破」，被告席傳出低聲的「嘩」。陳慶偉問，是「突破（breakthrough）」，抑或「打破（break down）」？趙回應「我諗兩個意思都有啲嘅，咁依個當然係我嘅理解啦」。何桂藍微笑又聳肩，林卓廷和鄒家成亦發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙再稱何發言沒記在助手筆記-因當時聽到着無需記錄-多人發笑&quot;&gt;趙再稱何發言沒記在助手筆記 因當時聽到着無需記錄 多人發笑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉再問，是「是透過打破來達致突破（to breakdown in order to breakthrough）？」，趙指「有依個意思」，又指何因想透過立法會做到該效果，「就會變咗係議會戰線同國際戰線呢就一齊去聯合嘅」。陳慶偉指，何是抗爭派，那是典型（typical）的發言，趙同意，並指警方錄口供時指何的政治信念和看法「其實喺其他嘅證供都好充分」，故不特別需要他講解，亦沒有記錄在供詞上，林卓廷一度說「嘩」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 指，因此趙剛才所說的沒有記錄在其供詞，亦沒有被他很盡責的總幹事黎敬輝記錄在新東兩次會議的筆記上？趙答：「因為我頭先都講咗，我聽到相關嘅訊息，咁我叫佢無需要記錄」，鄒家成、林卓廷等多人發笑，吳政亨笑到俯身，頭埋在膝上電腦。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指民動3月已答應承辦初選-趙極之不正確&quot;&gt;辯方指民動3月已答應承辦初選 趙：極之不正確&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續展示民主動力眾籌網頁的內容，其中在35+計劃內容和進度的部分，顯示2020年3月「戴耀廷及區諾軒作主導，民主動力協助，與18區區議會民主派主席、副主席及民選議員，以及民主派人士進行協調會議，商討立法會選舉的協調安排」。另外內容又提及2020年5月，「多方逐步達成共識，立法會5個地方選區，及屬功能組別的區議會（第二）及衛生服務界，一致決定會進行民主派35+公民投票。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問到，文件沒有提及民主動力於5月答應承辦初選，是因為他們在3月已經答應？趙回答：「極之不正確。」而趙早前提及此頁面是沒有公開，李運騰再次要求趙確認，趙稱這是助手應國安處要求所提供的資料，是登入了網頁的編輯版面。李問到公眾可否進入此頁面，法官陳慶偉則問有沒有向公眾發布過，趙表示不能肯定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指民動2至3月已開始參與初選-趙係咬文嚼字式嘅提問&quot;&gt;辯方指民動2至3月已開始參與初選 趙：係咬文嚼字式嘅提問&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 其後展示民主動力工作報告，在「獲委託承辦民主派35+公民投票」一欄，亦提到「2020年3月開始，戴耀廷及區諾軒主導，民主動力協助，各區議會民主派正副主席主持⋯與民主派人士於各區進行協調會議，最終達成共識一致決定舉行公民投票」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 再問，民主動力是否於2020年3月開始參與？李運騰要求釐清「參與」的意思，陳慶偉並改問，即趙家賢和民主動力就「35+」的參與是比他說的5月要早很多，可能早於2月及3月已開始，問他是同意、不同意或部分同意？趙表示：「法官閣下，依個其實係咬文嚼字式嘅一啲提問嚟㗎啫」，延伸庭的黃之鋒聞後「O嘴」，岑敖暉則面露驚訝。陳慶偉解釋，辯方並非「咬文嚼字」提問，只是向他指出其說法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙最後同意早於3月協調會民動已有參與35計劃&quot;&gt;趙最後同意早於3月協調會民動已有參與「35+計劃」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;最後趙稱：「回應法官閣下，其實而家螢幕睇到，『獲委託承辦』嗰句我其實琴日都已經有講解過」，陳追問即他不同意？趙表示要補充3月底時，民動已獲邀列席協調會議並提供意見，「呢個係一個事實嚟嘅，但係⋯」，惟遭李運騰打斷。李指，「參與」一詞的意思廣闊，可意指自己或派代表出席會議，或是在會上發言，而若上述任何一項都可被歸類為「參與」，那民主動力是否早於3月已參與在「35+計劃」中？趙回答：「喺依方面係嘅」，黃之鋒發笑。陳仲衡追問，文件同時提及民動「協助」與「悉託承辦」，意思是否有不同？趙指「非常大嘅不同啦當然」，惟欲解釋時陳慶偉打斷指無需深究。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙不同意戴耀廷無正式邀請民動承辦初選-原因為他們一早參與其中&quot;&gt;趙不同意戴耀廷無正式邀請民動承辦初選 原因為他們一早參與其中&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢曾稱5月初獲戴耀廷邀請承辦初選，Beel 引述戴耀廷於2020年5月9日向趙家賢發訊息稱，「昨天與鍾庭耀傾過，希望由民動去眾籌初選及民調，再委託他們做。你認為眾籌之事在此記者會講還是另安排眾籌記者會？民動過去有用眾籌平台嗎？」Beel 指，戴沒有提及邀請民動承辦初選，趙沉默數秒。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指，Beel 是向他指出，戴在書面上沒有提及邀請民動承辦初選。趙沉默10秒後表示，早前曾提及戴本想找香港民意研究所的鍾庭耀負責眾籌及初選，但由於「鍾庭耀嗰邊唔制」，戴遂與鍾商討想由民動負責眾籌，而民研只是負責投票點票系統和技術工作；又指因設立地區票站、人力資源等「香港民研係不會負責嘅」，因此戴想民動幫忙。Beel 指出，戴耀廷之所以沒有提及正式邀請民動承辦初選，是因為民動一早已經參與在組織初選當中？趙直接用英文回答：「extremely disagree.（極不同意。）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方問是否表現自己為政治立場溫和-趙激動答僅說事實-官提醒不要覺得被針對&quot;&gt;辯方問是否表現自己為政治立場溫和 趙激動答僅說事實 官提醒不要覺得被針對&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，趙作供時是否嘗試將自己表現成政治立場溫和、並會在2019年示威中進行調解的人？趙立即回答：「你再講多次，我驚個翻譯有失誤。」Beel 再重複，問趙作供時是否將自己表現成政治立場溫和（“You have put yourself forward as someone politically moderate …”)，並願在2019年示威中調解（mediate）的人？趙瞪着 Beel 大聲激動回答：「I’m not put(ting) myself forward, I just told the fact!（我不是要這樣表現自己，只是說出事實！）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉着趙以廣東話回答，又稱：「Don’t get personal, he’s doing his job.（不要覺得要針對你個人，律師只是做他的工作。）」，並指若趙不同意的話可以照直說不同意，並再次說「Don’t get personal」。最後趙細聲說：「I disagree.（不同意。）」在延伸庭的黃之鋒發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方質疑趙不同意使用大殺傷力憲制武器與選擇認罪不符&quot;&gt;辯方質疑趙不同意使用「大殺傷力憲制武器」與選擇認罪不符&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 最後向趙家賢指出辯方案情，指民主動力實早於2020年2至3月已參與「35+計劃」，而退出的唯一原因就是因受到國務院和港澳辦譴責，惟法官指此前趙已回答。Beel 續問趙是否支持戴耀廷使用「大殺傷力憲制武器」？趙不同意。Beel 說，根據控方案情，這似乎與趙選擇認罪不符（inconsistent），惟陳慶偉打斷，並着趙家賢先避席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續指，簡言之辯方問題是趙為什麼要認罪，Beel 同意，指控方案情是指控被告透過立會過半解散立會和令特首下台，意味趙家賢若認罪便要承認此案情。陳慶偉問為何不留待陳詞，Beel 再指因為趙證供似乎與他認罪不符，故想問趙以什麼基礎認罪？陳指，趙可以因為不同原因認罪，但辯方和法庭或因「法律專業保密特權（Legal Professional Privilege，LPP）」而不能問及，Beel 指他理解。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續指，故 Beel 最終是希望指出趙的證供與他認罪是完全不符，並以此質疑他的可信性，但重申不認為需要問趙為何認罪。李運騰指，相關發問或違 LPP，問 Beel 能想到其他方法處理嗎？陳慶偉亦指，當然知道辯方的說法，就是趙最終將所有責任推到他的職員身上，並只是承認對監察職員的疏忽，即沒有做到『盡職審查』的責任（“… essentially he put all the blame on his staff, and essentially he only admitted his negligence in supervising his staff, and he failed to perform due diligence.”）。此前趙曾數度於庭上提及自己沒有盡此責任。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問趙是否知任控方證人可減刑-趙先稱有責任協助作證-後同意有此可能性&quot;&gt;官問趙是否知任控方證人可減刑 趙先稱有責任協助作證 後同意有此可能性&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢其後再入庭，Beel 遂向他指出辯方案情，指趙家賢嘗試在證供中，將他2020年的參與講到最低，同時渲染、怪責和誇大其他人的參與（embellished, blamed and exaggerated the involvement of others），甚至嘗試指其當事人為有偏見的新聞工作者，貶低她的聲譽，趙均不同意。Beel 再提及，趙有一個「可恥的希望（shameful hope）」，又指其供詞是「不誠實（deceitful）」，惟被陳慶偉打斷，着他不要加那些形容詞，李運騰亦說「我們不需帶任何情緒到這裡（“We don’t need any emotion here.”）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續指，趙這樣做是為了獲得較輕的刑期？趙不同意。李運騰續指，但趙知道透過認罪和任控方證人，他可獲得刑期扣減？又雙手張開笑說：「這是所有人都知道的。（“Everybody knows about that.”）」。趙答：「回應法官閣下，我有責任係去協助作證，係向法庭去將我所知嘅整個事件嘅情況去講述」，林卓廷發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李追問，那趙知道認罪會獲得減刑嗎？趙指「認罪減刑呢個知道嘅」，李再問，那是否知道向控方提供證據也會有減刑（“… you can expect some discount?”）？陳慶偉補充是「或會有減刑（may be entitled to some discount）」，庭內傳出笑聲，趙答「係，因為冇 guarantee（保證）嘅」。李問，但也會有這個希望？陳慶偉指是有「可能性」，趙答「有咁嘅機會」。Beel 再問，是這個可能性推動趙作供？質疑他不是誠實的證人。陳慶偉指可留待陳詞，Beel 續指發問完畢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（21日）踏入審訊第48天，趙家賢接受陳志全的代表大狀盤問。趙曾於口供提及，陳志全派代表出席首次新界東協調會議，惟庭上獲展示助手筆記後，改稱陳本人亦有出席。辯方今播放片段，指陳當晚正在數碼港為「D100」節目《人民主場》做直播，不可能出席會議，趙強調回想到陳志全與助手一同出現的畫面，但亦真誠確信辯方資料為真確，故只能回應「no comment」。辯方續指人人都會犯錯，有沒有可能是趙搞錯了？惟趙沒有正面回答，僅稱同意每人都有機會犯錯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，趙今在盤問下同意，2021年6月進行首次錄影會面時已願意協助警方調查；惟被問他是透過律師表示望任控方證人，抑或是由警方邀請，則據「法律專業保密特權」稱不願意作答，但確認有與警方討論，亦確認望獲額外減刑是錄口供的其中一個因素。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢同意陳志全為盡責理性議員從不視為本土抗爭派&quot;&gt;趙家賢同意陳志全為盡責理性議員、從不視為本土抗爭派&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍的代表大狀早上完成盤問趙家賢，續由代表陳志全的大律師馬維騉盤問。被問何時認識陳志全，趙猶豫稱約於2012、13年，後同意於2012年陳當選立法會議員時認識他，而此前因陳於電台做節目、有「知名度」，已認知有他這個人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ThG2UvM.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問是否清楚陳的立場，趙指「不太確定」，但同意辯方指他是非常盡責（very conscientious）的議員，指從民主派和建制派議員均聽到該稱讚，也看到陳就一些法案或提問「係好有準備」。趙亦同意陳是理性的立法會議員，從來不視他為本土抗爭派，而是傳統民主派下的「進步民主派」。法官陳仲衡一度問，那趙會否視戴耀廷為本土抗爭派？庭上傳出笑聲。趙思索片刻未回答，馬補充即戴有時會表現為本土抗爭派？趙細聲答「係嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢多次追問下不記得何時表示擬認罪-翻查資料為2021年9月&quot;&gt;趙家賢多次追問下不記得何時表示擬認罪 翻查資料為2021年9月&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬續就趙家賢2022年9月錄取首份證人供詞的背景發問。趙同意，他於2022年6月庭上閱讀案情摘要後認罪，而該份摘要早於同年2月已透過律師交予他。馬續問，趙是何時首次向律師表示擬認罪並同意本案案情？並提醒趙可因「法律專業保密特權（Legal Professional Privilege，LPP）」而不回答。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰將問題分拆，先問趙何時首次提出認罪意向？趙低頭思考。李追問是哪年哪月，趙思考約15秒答「2021年嘅時候」，馬問是年尾？並提到趙是於2021年3月1日首度提堂，問能否喚醒其記憶？趙再沉默約10秒。李追問是哪個季節？趙沉默數秒再稱：「抱歉我真係唔記得啦。」李再追問是年中抑或年尾，趙反問他是何時認罪，惟獲告知後仍未能回答。（翻查資料，趙於2021年9月23日的第二次提訊日，在庭上與區諾軒和鍾錦麟表明擬認罪。）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方問是趙提出任控方證人抑或警察接觸-趙根據法律保密特權不願作答&quot;&gt;辯方問是趙提出任控方證人抑或警察接觸 趙根據法律保密特權不願作答&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉其後展示趙家賢2022年9月29日的首份「無損權益口供」，顯示於小欖精神病治療中心錄取。趙同意，該份口供是他還柙期間，警方探訪他「起碼6、7次」後錄取，但不太記得整個探訪橫跨多少時間，而整份口供連同附件有約1,800頁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬續問，趙是透過律師表示願意任控方證人，抑或是由警察接觸他？法官陳慶偉即提醒，此問題牽涉「法律專業保密特權」，指趙和律師的對話受法律保障，除非他願意，否則並非一定要作答。趙低頭約5秒，續說：「多謝法官閣下，咁我根據返嗰個法律專業保密條例，根據返條條例，我就唔願意作答。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬續問，警察曾否接觸並邀請趙任證人？趙答：「有討論。」李運騰問那趙首次表示願意錄取控方證人供詞時，他已經認罪了嗎？趙指「向警方提供時我未認罪嘅」，惟問法官指的口供是否指「NPS（Non-prejudicial statement，無損權益口供）」。李運騰確認，指並非談及錄影會面，而是證人供詞，又提醒趙不願意的話不用作答，趙沉默約10秒未有回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙確認於2021年6月進行首次錄影會面-同意當時已願意協助警方調查&quot;&gt;趙確認於2021年6月進行首次錄影會面 同意當時已願意協助警方調查&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉遂改問，趙是何時有意協助警方？趙表示，於2021年6、7月曾錄取兩份錄影會面記錄，「咁就住警方嘅調查我係願意提供所需嘅資訊」，同意即2021年時他已願意協助警方：「因為當時願意做個 VIR（應為 VRI，video-recorded interview），其實就係向警方提供訊息，咁當然係協助警方去做個調查。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指出，當趙進行錄影會面，只是作為被告（suspect）提供資料，但當他錄取「無損權益口供」，就是作為潛在證人（potential witness）提供資料，指兩者完全不同，趙表示明白。陳慶偉再指，趙可在午飯時思考到底他何時表示有意成為控方證人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙離開法庭後，陳慶偉問馬維騉上述盤問的目的是什麼？馬指趙作為控方證人，表明會盡力作出真確的供詞，惟其供詞的說法卻與庭上證供不符。陳問若是如此，為何需要知道趙何時認罪和同意成為控方證人？馬維騉指那些議題對他來說不重要。陳再問既然不重要又為何要問，馬稱只是想為提問建立基礎，不知會花這麼多時間。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指為獲額外減刑故錄口供-趙稱我諗思維上係其中一個因素&quot;&gt;辯方指為獲額外減刑故錄口供 趙稱「我諗思維上係其中一個因素」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢午飯後確認，在錄取「無損權益口供」時已經認罪及同意案情。馬維騉續問，毫無疑問，趙錄取這份口供是希望獲得額外減刑？趙回應：「我諗當時思維上依個係其中一個因素。」馬續指，相信趙落口供時亦想到《國安法》第33條，即自動放棄犯罪、自動投案或揭發他人犯罪行為可減刑的條文，趙指於2020年7月14日，區諾軒已向他提及過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡着辯方直接問重點，馬維騉遂問，因為趙望能獲接納成為控方證人，故會盡力向警方提供他所知的資訊？趙稱：「我作為願意去作證，當然要盡力將我所知嘅去協助法庭同埋警方去調查案件」，但認為辯方問題前句指他希望可獲接納為證人是有「前設」，「我就唔係太同意。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙口供稱陳志全由代表出席協調會-惟庭上看助手筆記後改口&quot;&gt;趙口供稱陳志全由代表出席協調會 惟庭上看助手筆記後改口&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉其後展示口供並就此發問，當中趙提及2020年5月5日新東第二次協調會議的出席者和情況，列明陳志全是由助理代表出席。馬維騉指趙早前已稱其口供出錯，他應只曾出席4月14日的第一次新東會議；趙並同意就當天會上的情況，已經將他所聽所見說出。馬續問，趙稱陳志全由代表出席會議，是來自他的記憶？趙稱：「當時錄口供嘅時候係」，並同意庭上曾獲展示助手黎敬輝就該次會議的筆記，顯示陳本人亦有出席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問到，在錄口供期間警方有沒有向趙展示黎的筆記？趙指是「好大量嘅文件」，「有啲位我有睇」，但當時或未有好確切看清楚而有此「誤會」，後確認是不記得。陳仲衡再問，趙只是依賴黎的筆記才回答陳志全有出席會議，還是筆記喚起他的記憶？趙稱是後者。馬維騉其後引趙供詞，提及警方向他展示「附件十六」共674頁，確認該些文件是他與黎敬輝的 WhatsApp 對話，又列出黎向他報告各區會議出席人士和對話內容所屬的訊息號碼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙補充指錄口供時只是不確認陳志全有否出席-故警方建議只寫由代表出席&quot;&gt;趙補充指錄口供時只是不確認陳志全有否出席 故警方建議只寫由代表出席&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉其後展示黎敬輝的筆記，顯示就當天出席者名單包括「慢必 蘇浩」。馬續指出，趙過份依賴（over-rely）黎的筆記，當他的記憶與筆記有出入時，就選擇依賴筆記；李運騰亦追問趙稱陳志全有出席會議是否錯誤，趙不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙其後再確認，是控方主問時閱讀筆記才記起陳志全亦在場。馬質疑已事隔3年，趙續指有「少少想補充返」，表示錄首份口供被警方問及陳志全有否親自出席會議時，「我記得蘇浩係有出席嘅，但當時我記憶呢，我唔係確認只係得佢一個出席，我只係唔係好確認陳志全係有冇出席⋯⋯因為咁嘅關係，警方就同我講因為白紙黑字，就話係陳志全嘅代表啦。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指陳志全正為d100節目直播故不可能開會-趙no-comment&quot;&gt;辯方指陳志全正為「D100」節目直播故不可能開會 趙：no comment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉其後播放陳志全主持「D100」電台節目《人民主場》的片段，片頭顯示「主持：陳志全（慢必）、譚得志（快必）」，其後兩人露面，畫面寫有節目是逢星期二晚7時半至8時半播放。馬問趙有否留意這個節目，他稱「抱歉唔知道」，又指知道陳有在網台「開咪」，但不知道是「D100」的節目、亦不知節目名，亦不知道是上述時間直播。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬續播放陳志全4月14日（新東會議當晚）主持《人民主場》的片段，顯示陳報時稱現在是晚上7時35分，並稱：「正如我今日開記者會嘅時候同香港人講，呢個係一個⋯⋯」馬指出，陳志全根本不可能出席同日晚上7至9時於旺角舉行的新東首次協調會議，因他當時正在數碼港進行直播節目，並問這會否動搖趙稱陳有出席該會議的記憶。趙思考逾半分鐘，延伸庭有被告模仿趙笑稱「抱歉法官閣下，我唔記得」，黃之鋒發笑，鄒家成和吳政亨也笑着做打圈手勢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙其後回答：「馬大狀或者我咁嘅回應，因為當我有回想到蘇浩同陳志全呢，喺教協個會議室有出現嘅畫面，而我都真誠地確信你提供嘅呢啲資料係真確，所以我只可以對你嘅提問作出嘅回應係 no comment。」 這時多名被告及旁聽人士大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰追問，所以趙是記得陳於會議當晚在場，但解釋不到為何他似乎又在另一個地方主持節目？趙答「係」，多人再發笑，被告席傳來「嘩」。趙續同意辯方指，他在錄口供時清楚記得蘇浩而非陳志全在場，惟讀過黎敬輝的筆記後，「回想返」印象有改變。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官質疑辯方如何證明節目是直播-辯方稱會盡力找不在場證據包括cctv&quot;&gt;官質疑辯方如何證明節目是直播 辯方稱會盡力找不在場證據包括CCTV&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉其後質疑，辯方現時是以該片段挑戰趙的記憶，但如何證明陳志全主持的節目時間是真確的？李運騰亦指辯方需就此提供證據，否則只屬傳聞證供。法官其後要求趙家賢避席，問辯方有否任何證據，馬維騉表示是來自陳志全的指示。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉追問有沒有其他證據，陳仲衡亦問如何證明節目是逢星期二晚直播。馬表示，此前的控方案情包括區諾軒證供，均指陳志全兩次協調會議都沒有出席，是直至趙家賢供稱陳志全有出席後，他才開始收集陳的不在場證據。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬續指，會向「D100」的職員查詢能否取得有關證據，以及向數碼港查詢能否提供停車場的閉路電視片段。陳仲衡指現已事隔兩年，馬則回應望法庭明白其困難，重申趙的供詞亦指陳是派代表出席，他沒預想過會有這樣的情況出現，重申會盡力找出證據證明。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱無印象陳志全於會上發言-強調聽到有人攻擊民主動力會豎起隻耳仔&quot;&gt;趙稱無印象陳志全於會上發言 強調聽到有人攻擊民主動力會「豎起隻耳仔」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續確認，在4月14日會議當晚遲到，並曾於晚上7時19分向黎敬輝發訊息指因區議會會議遲了，現正搭的士來。趙解釋，當時在西灣河東區法院出席完區議會會議，遂搭的士前往旺角中僑大廈教協會址的新東會議。李運騰追問是否經東區海底隧道，趙思考數秒後回答「係」，有被告發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡問訊息有否喚起（ring the bell）趙到達會議的印象，李運騰亦問最後他是否有成功到達，趙笑言「有」，並因交通擠塞故8時左右到達，並在會議逗留了約一小時，期間使用電腦處理公務。馬問他是否不時留意戴耀廷有否「亂講嘢」？趙表示：「未必淨係佢嘅，會有啲與會者會係攻擊吓民主動力係咪大台呀，喺度欺壓啲素人呀，當聽到民主動力嘅嘢咁我都會豎起隻耳仔。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬續指，黎的筆記沒有提及陳志全或蘇浩有在會上發言，趙表示：「我冇乜太大印象。」馬續指出，他沒有印象是因陳志全根本沒有出席會議，趙不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方展示片段-指陳志全第二次新東會議期間亦主持電台節目&quot;&gt;辯方展示片段 指陳志全第二次新東會議期間亦主持電台節目&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於5月5日第二次新東會議同為星期二，馬維騉其後再播放當晚陳志全主持《人民主場》的片段，陳報時稱現在是晚上7時40分，趙重申不知道有此節目。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬最後指，趙稱陳志全有出席4月14日會議，而黎敬輝筆記提及陳和蘇浩一同出席，問趙是否可能搞錯了？他並指這對其當事人來說是很重要的問題。趙望着傳譯主任的電腦螢幕沉默逾半分鐘答：「馬大狀我知道係重要嘅問題，但係我好清楚喺個法庭度都講，係喺我回想返當中，喺蘇浩隔離，陳志全係一齊喺教協個位置係有出現」，又指因他向法庭作證，「我只可以將我所知、我最準確知道嘅嘢講出嚟。」陳志全皺眉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方問趙有否可能搞錯-趙無正面回答僅同意每人都有機會犯錯&quot;&gt;辯方問趙有否可能搞錯 趙無正面回答、僅同意每人都有機會犯錯&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬續指，人人都會犯錯，有沒有可能是趙搞錯了？趙只是答：「每個人喺唔同時候都有機會犯錯嘅，呢個我同意。」陳慶偉問，所以趙遇到陳志全一定是在4月14日或5月5日的會議，除非他因為其他原因到旺角，陳志全、彭卓棋和柯耀林等發笑。趙同意，並重申只記得陳有出席首次會議，李運騰指認為繼續問下去也沒什麼意義。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬再指出，陳志全兩次會議均沒有出席，陳慶偉問趙同意嗎？趙答：「回應法官閣下，喺我頭先所講，我能夠回想我覺得最準確嘅認知底下，我只能夠答不同意。」案件下周一（24日）10時半後續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，早上完成盤問的何桂藍代表大狀 Trevor Beel，下午因身體不適未有到庭。近日多名被告和律師團隊不適，黃碧雲和梁國雄不時咳嗽，何桂藍亦抹鼻涕。散庭後，旁聽的陳皓桓向被告揮手大喊：「保重身體！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/aERufUi.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（19日）踏入審訊第47天。對民主動力帖文提及「對抗暴政」，趙家賢曾稱絕非民動立場，昨又表示自己不會使用該字眼。代表何桂藍的大狀 Trevor Beel 今引不同文件質疑，其中趙家賢2019年11月被咬耳後透過民動發出的公告亦提及「對抗暴政」，惟趙指「嗰陣時我喺醫院瞓咗係度」。法官問辯方用意，Beel 指是質疑趙家賢可信性，法官一度提醒或有反效果，指其當事人亦有參與民動組織的初選，亦可能會擴闊「共謀者原則」範圍。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，趙家賢強調民動於2020年5月中下旬才答應辦初選，惟辯方展示文件，顯示趙2月曾與戴耀廷、區諾軒等人開會討論初選。趙強調該次僅屬「初步交流」，而助手筆記提及「操作：民動」亦只是提議非決議。他又指答應承辦初選時無簽文件，承認是「罪責、錯誤」，指民主派好多工作「講個信字」；亦絕不同意辯方指，他稱若知道戴耀廷文章就不會承辦初選的說法是虛構。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;受襲後於工作報告提及對抗暴政趙表示非自己寫我喺醫院瞓咗係度&quot;&gt;受襲後於工作報告提及「對抗暴政」趙表示非自己寫：我喺醫院瞓咗係度&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢續接受代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 盤問。趙昨在盤問下表示，他不會使用「對抗暴政」的字眼。Beel 續引民主動力2018年11月至2020年12月的工作報告，提到趙家賢在太古城中心外遭咬耳後，於2019年11月4日發出新聞公告，表示：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;「對昨日發生極端親政府兇徒襲擊包括其本人在內的太古城居民及市民，感到極為震驚就憤慨…趙家賢已完成手術，仍需觀察及休養，暫時未知何時出院…趙家賢呼籲所有民主派區議會候選人、太古城居民及香港市民，要謹慎保護自身安全，並重申在面對親政府陣營的暴力威嚇，絕不屈服退縮；團結一致，堅持到底，對抗暴政。」&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問到上述內容是否由趙家賢撰寫，還是由其助手黎敬輝所寫，趙稱：「回應辯方律師，嗰陣時我喺醫院瞓咗係度」。Beel 追問，故內容並非由趙所寫？趙大聲稱：「我已經回答咗，我當時喺醫院做完手術，睇下駁唔駁得返隻耳，仲喺醫院度休養緊。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙承認無檢查職員起草的報告-再強調我最終要負責&quot;&gt;趙承認無檢查職員起草的報告 再強調：我最終要負責&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉問，雖然並非他撰寫，但他是民主動力的召集人，而這份是工作報告，故他必定採納當中的內容？趙表示之前已講解過民主動力工作報告的草擬模式，是由職員所撰寫，包括總幹事黎敬輝及兼職職員。陳表示明白其做法是根據時序，趙補充，職員會根據時序抽取 Facebook 聲明的內容，再擺放在報告之中；當趙知道黎敬輝的做法和方向後，就沒有再仔細檢視他起草的工作報告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙亦再次重申：「當然我都係喺呢個法庭度，我已經多次講我作為民主動力嘅召集人，最終要負責任，所有關於民主動力嘅事情我一定最終要負責，呢個我講得好清楚。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方欲質疑趙家賢可信性-官一度提醒或有反效果&quot;&gt;辯方欲質疑趙家賢可信性 官一度提醒或有反效果&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰打斷問 Beel，這件事是2019年發生，到底他想問的是甚麼？Beel 表示，他想知道民主動力的政治立場，因趙早前稱帖文中提及「光復議會」、「對抗暴政」絕對並非民動的立場，但事實上民動在2019年及2020年常用到上述字眼，與趙的供詞並不相符。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續質疑，即使民動立場是「對抗暴政」，這如何協助辯方案情，Beel 指他會質疑趙證供的可信性，指趙的說法虛構、沒有說出全部真相。李提醒 Beel 的做法可能會產生反效果（backfire），並要求趙避席。李續指，法庭現時就此沒有看法，但提醒 Beel 的當事人也有參與由民動所組織的初選，若辯方指民動有堅定的政治立場，或需思考相關盤問引申的含義；又強調不是要阻止辯方盤問，法庭亦願接受辯方游說（open to persuasion）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡則補充，若辯方是指民動的立場與工作報告一致，而民動一直都是知情並願意參與「35+」，或會擴大本案「共謀者原則」（co-conspirator’s rule）應用的範圍。Beel 重申只是質疑證人的可信性，又指要先證明串謀存在，上述原則才適用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;工作報告提及共抗暴政-趙稱無民動執委成員提反對&quot;&gt;工作報告提及「共抗暴政」 趙稱無民動執委成員提反對&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 其後續引民動工作報告，提及在2019年11月17日，民主動力邀請立法會議員及民主派區議會候選人，在愛丁堡廣場舉行造勢大會，展示團結，以區議會選舉作變相公投「五大訴求，一起公投」為共同政綱，「一同於社區推動及鼓勵市民投票，共抗暴政」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 指，報告時間為2018年11月至2020年12月，趙當時如對用字有任何不滿意，是否可作出修改？趙低頭說：「我啱啱離開之前我已經作答咗」，強調就工作報告他沒有仔細看，只是「䁽吓」。陳仲衡問，但大會上有沒有出席人士叫喊「共抗暴政」？趙再低頭說：「回應法官閣下，我並不知道，我當時喺東區醫院。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在李運騰提問下，趙確認該工作報告曾呈交予執委會，亦應該有向執委會成員展示；亦同意出席的成員會收到報告，而職員曾稱稍後會發送電子版本予缺席者。趙表示超過一半的執委會成員出席才可舉行會議，而會上沒有成員就報告提及的民動立場提出反對，「大家收到份嘢都係䁽吓眼。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉一度，趙曾指職員是據時序寫報告，但為何當中提及2020年5月的事情後，又會再返回2019年5月？趙表示報告的整理方式是由職員向他講解，而有關工作敘述的段落大致都是順時序，但「唔知係咪攝入錯咗，定時序錯咗」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方引眾籌頁面提光時-趙重申由總幹事處理&quot;&gt;辯方引眾籌頁面提「光時」 趙重申由總幹事處理&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 再展示民主動力的眾籌文件，當中「公民投票背景」提及「暴政又於今年加推國歌法、國安法，對港人的輾壓施暴變本加厲⋯不同戰線繼續努力，才可擺脫極權魔爪，建立民主制度⋯合計過半，才可光復立法會，奪回控制權，壓制港共政權，再繼而改革政制，建立民主政府。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文件亦提及「我們能滴水穿石，共同盡最大的努力打破缺口，創建未來。我們亦已無身後路。我們需要你的支持，若能成功，光復香港時代革命便不再只是一句口號。我們需要重奪立法會，香港才能浴火重生」等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙確認，民主動力負責為初選眾籌。被問頁面是否由民動設計，趙重申因他不熟悉眾籌平台運作，故相關行政工作全由總幹事黎幹事處理，他事後亦認為「出咗事」；又指警方應是根據《國安法》要求黎敬輝提供資料，黎遂提供編輯眾籌頁面的非公開版面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙重申民動於5月中下旬始承辦初選-辯方引黎敬輝記錄指趙2月曾出席九東會議&quot;&gt;趙重申民動於5月中下旬始承辦初選 辯方引黎敬輝記錄指趙2月曾出席九東會議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;眾籌頁面亦提及「35+計劃」的時間表，指2020年3月「戴耀廷副教授及前立法會議員區諾軒作主導，民主動力協助，與18區區議會民主派主席、副主席及民選議員，以及民主派人士進行協調會議，商討立法會選舉的協調安排」。就民動於3月已「協助」初選，趙再重申是於5月中下旬才同意承辦，而3月中則是獲邀列席會議進行經驗分享，而因為該句「唔係一個好長嘅句子」，故稱民動的角色是「協助」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟 Beel 指，事實上趙家賢早於2月10日已被邀請出席一次九龍東會議並討論初選，問那是否他第一次參與「35+」的工作？趙指該次並非協調會議。此前審訊從未提及該次會議，Beel 續展示趙家賢與黎敬輝的 WhatsApp 紀錄，顯示黎為該會議記下的筆記，趙以約1至2分鐘閱讀。Beel 問有否喚醒趙的記憶，趙重申記得有會議進行，但並非協調會。Beel 指該會議是為初選協調的準備、是所有事情的源起（genesis），陳慶偉問趙是否接受該說法？趙靜默約5秒後稱「唔接受」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙確認蔡澤鴻邀請出席6人會議會上無潛在參選人-強調屬初步交流&quot;&gt;趙確認蔡澤鴻邀請出席6人會議、會上無潛在參選人 強調屬「初步交流」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續向趙指，辯方是指出其案情，就是民主動力在「35+計劃」的參與是更早發生。趙沒有直接回答，僅指記錄當然清楚顯示當時曾討論初選的技術細節等，而他記得戴當時提及有一間西班牙IT公司，有技術確保投票時伺服器不會被「殭屍電腦」「炸機」，並打算找該機構協助初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，時任觀塘區議會主席蔡澤鴻曾向他表示：「戴耀廷約左我哋去傾喎，你都嚟埋啦，你知戴耀廷、戴妖㗎啦，又唔知佢咩葫蘆賣咩藥，我哋咁耐嚟講做開協調都係信民主動力㗎啦，咁梗係搵埋阿趙你，搵埋你嚟聽個會」。趙家賢提及「戴妖」時，多人發笑，余慧明掩面，法庭傳譯主任譯為「Monster Tai」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙確認，是蔡澤鴻邀他出席該次會議，亦確認筆記指出席者包括趙家賢、蔡澤鴻、時任黃大仙區議會副主席黃逸旭、區諾軒、戴耀延及黎敬輝。李運騰問，因此會議是由計劃最初的組織者，或之後成為組織者的人出席？趙未有直接回答，僅指因九東是最小的選區，故戴耀廷望先在該區商討初選，再一步步擴至其他區。李再問，即會議只有上述6人出席，沒有其他潛在參選人？趙同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，雖然會議是有關九龍東，但事實上會上亦談及九東以外的事情？趙再指戴當時約了九東的區議會正副主席，有如「我準備傾初選，就嚟探吓路、拜吓啲地保」，蔡澤鴻並着他看看戴耀廷有何想法。李運騰打斷指不是談及蔡澤鴻的角色，指筆記提及新西、新東、九西、港島等，問會上的議題是否涉九龍東以外的選區？趙同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指，故會議是一個做準備的會議？陳慶偉亦問即是初步（preliminary）的會議？趙答：「我同意陳仲衡法官所講，係 preliminary ，但係一個 exchange」，意指即「初步交流」而非「初步會議」。陳慶偉即笑着指住左邊的陳仲衡，指「他才是陳仲衡（“He is Johnny Chan.”）」，多人發笑，法庭職員着旁聽席「靜啲」，趙家賢輕聲說「sorry」。Beel 則笑言，趙家賢一直都沒有稱呼他的名字，只是叫他做「大狀」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;筆記提操作民動-趙強調只是提議非決定&quot;&gt;筆記提「操作：民動」 趙強調只是提議非決定&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，為何黎敬輝會做此記錄？趙指應該是他叫黎記錄會上重點。此前趙曾稱因在新東會上就運用否決權用字有爭議時在場，故着黎不用記錄，Beel 續問：「即使你當時在場和知道發生什麼事（仍叫黎做記錄）？」，惟陳慶偉以「Thank you, thank you.」打斷。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續展示記錄提及：「操作：民動；民調：鍾庭耀；倡議人＋平台」，問民主動力是否初選的操作者？趙低頭思考一會，解釋「應該係戴耀廷同我講當時佢有希望民主動力幫手」，但再稱「好記得」戴有提及要找西班牙IT公司做投票系統。惟陳慶偉再打斷，指筆記表面上是否顯示民主動力就是初選操作人，趙答：「應該係，所以我個助手先會咁樣做記錄。」李運騰問，當時是提議找民主動力幫手，抑或已決定由民動幫手？趙指「依個冇決議」，重申是「戴耀廷做協調之前嘅探路、拜地保嘅做法」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱答應承辦初選時無簽文件屬錯誤大家工作都係講個信字&quot;&gt;趙稱答應承辦初選時無簽文件屬錯誤：大家工作都係講個信字&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 其後再問及民主動力獲邀請和答應承辦初選的日期，趙稱是5月初左右收到邀請，直至5月中至中下旬才確認承辦。Beel 追問，趙早前稱民動在5月20日後才答應承辦，他是否記得正式日子？趙稱：「正式日子我唔記得」。法官陳仲衡再問民動答應承辦時有沒有簽署任何文件，趙表示：「抱歉法官閣下，呢度我都要承認係其中一個罪責、錯誤之一；因為過往咁耐，民主派有好多工作大家都係講個信字去處理」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;曾稱若知道戴的文章不會答應承辦初選-趙否認是虛構&quot;&gt;曾稱若知道戴的文章不會答應承辦初選 趙否認是虛構&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 指出，民主動力實質上只獲邀做眾籌工作，最後亦只答應負責這方面，趙不同意。Beel 亦問，民主動力答應承辦的日子是重要事項，指趙稱5月才答應承辦初選是虛構的，惟陳慶偉均不批准發問。Beel 再問，趙稱若他知道戴耀廷的文章，就不會答應承辦初選，這個說法也是虛構，趙迅速回答：「extremely disagree（極不同意）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方質疑口供無提及哪日答應承辦初選-趙反問你想我答啲乜嘢&quot;&gt;辯方質疑口供無提及哪日答應承辦初選 趙反問：你想我答啲乜嘢？&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問趙，在他向警方錄取的4份口供之中，均沒有提及民主動力在5月哪一日開始承辦初選，趙反問：「你想我答啲乜嘢呀？」，這時黃之鋒「O嘴」，林卓廷發笑。陳慶偉將問題重複一次，趙思考數秒後表示：「法官閣下，我唔係好…」。 法官再指，即趙從沒告訴警察在哪日正式答應承辦初選，並告訴趙可以答同意、不同意或不記得，陳慶偉補充不是記憶測試。趙最後回答：「唔記得」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙否認記錯戴耀廷要求預留款項用途-稱戴總之想喺民主動力度chur返起碼80萬&quot;&gt;趙否認記錯戴耀廷要求預留款項用途 稱戴「總之想喺民主動力度chur返起碼80萬」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，Beel 今亦再問及民主動力的捐款。趙確認，戴耀廷於2020年8月底、9月初要求民動捐超過80萬予香港民研以收集對反對預算案的意見，他終建議捐40萬，但因執委會換屆未有處理，至被捕後銀行戶口亦被凍結。惟 Beel 展示趙家賢供詞，曾指戴耀廷是在2020年7月底向他談及就否決預算案設投票系統一事，又指戴預計初選結果於立會選舉延期後仍有效，望在2021年選舉前再進行民意調查。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 亦引訊息，其中戴耀廷在10月1日曾向趙發訊息稱：「Ben 告訴我民動會把錢捐給獨媒下的慈善機構，那筆錢大概會有多少？還有能確實可以給民意研究所的數目嗎？」，6日後又問「民意研究所想確知已籌的錢是否已把 800K 預先預備了作下年選前民調之用」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 指出，事實上趙家賢搞錯了，戴耀廷要求他預留的款項只是用作下一次選舉的選前民調，而非用來開發就否決財案向泛民施壓的投票系統。趙指「我冇搞亂到」，重申因「唔想民主動力再牽涉喺戴耀廷提出嘅呢啲項目當中，但一路上就覺得點樣都應該有一筆錢捐比香港民研」，故如調解員般提議「中間方案」，即捐無指定用途的40萬予民研，戴就「唔會話民主動力食咗嚿錢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，當時建議捐50萬予獨媒下做傳媒教育工作的慈善組織，及40萬予香港民研；而戴本身預計應可從民動拿到起碼80萬以上推動其項目，得知此消息後就以另一方法問民動有否預留80萬，「即係佢其實心目中總之都想喺民主動力度 chur 返起碼80萬嘅數額，嚟畀佢畀香港民意研究所做佢嘅研究」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙指，此前就此完全無任何提問，「因為對個案情嚟講都講得太遠」，故他無特別解釋；而現在望透過其講解能令辯方和法官知道他並非「搞亂咗」，「你會見到戴耀廷其實係咁 chur 住人⋯」，但遭 Beel 打斷。趙其後亦承認供詞提到戴7月底談及開發系統的日期是記錯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指戴不信參選人有共識否決財案-趙不同意-稱只是認為泛民可能褪軚&quot;&gt;辯方指戴不信參選人有共識否決財案 趙不同意 稱只是認為泛民可能「褪軚」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 最後問，根據趙與戴的對話，戴耀廷是否其實知道參選人沒有真正的共識？法官多番要求澄清問題字眼，Beel 解釋即戴知道民主派雖表面上似乎有共識（consensus for public consumption），但私下其實沒有共識。法官陳慶偉認為問題太複雜，改問從戴耀廷的說話，趙是否知道戴自己也不真誠相信，候選人之間有共識入立會後會否決財案？趙答：「我唔係咁嘅睇法。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰改問，趙提及戴望以民調影響傳統民主派否決預算案，而從二人對話，趙是否知道戴耀廷不相信傳統民主派在沒有壓力施加下會否決預算案？簡單而言，即戴耀廷是否不相信傳統民主派？趙回應，「我諗佢當時嘅思想會有『不相信』依個其中一個因素喺當中，而我嘅理解佢唔係覺得大家冇共識喺度，係會覺得傳統民主派可能去到嗰個位置嘅時候會自己褪軚。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李問，即戴認為傳統民主派未必會堅定遵守協議？趙指，因事情進展可能有很多變數，故戴希望有民意調查，「反映到民意嘅時候就令到傳統民主派冇顧慮啦。」陳慶偉總結，即趙不同意 Beel 的問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/IUc5f35.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（20日）踏入審訊第47天。代表何桂藍的大狀今早展示趙家賢個人 Facebook 帖文，提及「#香港正式進入準戰爭狀態」及「#香港人反抗」等，質疑趙並非聲稱般溫和，惟趙稱不記得有這些帖文。法官李運騰問帖文是否顯示趙為本土抗爭派，引起多人大笑，趙指「我自己都覺得好詫異」，指當時政局的情緒是「躁動」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過趙在午飯後主動提及，因「本身個腦嘅 memory 用晒喺案情」，休息後才回想起2019年8月因指示太古站示威者離開後有人被捕，被「深黃」居民指控「送人頭」並遭網上欺凌，續聘請價值觀較本土的居民協助管理 Facebook，指有關帖文應是由他所撰，強調對帖文「真係完全無任何印象」。此外，因有被告不適，審訊今提早完結，據了解是何桂藍感到不適。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙fb帖文稱一國兩制名存實亡及香港人反抗-遭質疑唔係你扮得咁溫和&quot;&gt;趙FB帖文稱「一國兩制名存實亡」及「香港人反抗」 遭質疑「唔係你扮得咁溫和」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢續接受代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 盤問。Beel 今早質疑趙曾稱「對抗暴政」非民動立場，民主動力工作報告卻提及相關字眼，他其後再展示趙的個人Facebook「Andrew Chiu（趙家賢）」， 其封面相片顯示他左耳被包紮，並面露微笑舉起「五一」手勢，旁邊有一張黃色海報，印有寫着「香港人」的PEPE圖案，以及底部寫着「五大訴求，缺一不可」。延伸庭的黃之鋒、袁嘉蔚及吳敏兒看到後不禁大聲發笑，正庭亦有被告和旁聽人士發笑。趙確認這是其 Facebook 專頁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續展示趙於2020年5月21日一則帖文，提及：「#一國兩制名存實亡 - 基本法二十三條必須本地立法，中共就透過港區人大提出附件三全國性法律引入香港版國家安全法，貫徹中共視法律如無物！ #長期抗爭 #毋忘初心。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;他在3月26日的帖文則指：「好多保皇建制專業人士，經常以自身有英國專業資格為傲，但又要緊跟中共反殖原則以便攞盡著數。呢個反帝反殖港共政府又引用殖民地過時條例？五十年冇引用過！我好想知道呢批人會有咩反應！（＃自己 unfriend我啦！）#PK鄧報私仇 #打壓民選議會 #濫捕議長 #香港正式進入準戰爭狀態 #抗爭無退路！ #香港人反抗！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 指出，上述內容看起來是抗爭派的帖文；陳慶偉問辯方想問甚麼，Beel 指趙不如他聲稱般溫和，陳續指這是趙的個人 Facebook 專頁，他可以發表他想表達的政見。李運騰續向趙笑指，辯方問題是「你唔係你扮得咁溫和？（“You are not moderate but you pretend to be?”）」，這時黃之鋒大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉再問，即在趙個人而言、而非民主動力，「你是非常激進嗎？」延伸庭的黃之鋒、袁嘉蔚、吳敏兒及譚凱邦均大笑。陳再追問，從 Facebook 帖文看來，趙同意或不同意？這時朱凱迪笑言：「又 Luke Lai（助手黎敬輝）？」趙望着身旁傳譯主任的電腦螢幕約20秒，又低頭思考，終答「回應法官閣下，我諗緊其實我都唔記得我有啲咁嘅 post」。林卓廷大笑，余慧明亦發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問帖文是否顯示屬本土抗爭派-趙稱覺得好詫異並指當時情緒躁動&quot;&gt;官問帖文是否顯示屬本土抗爭派 趙稱「覺得好詫異」並指當時情緒躁動&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問「如我說只看這些帖文，你是本土抗爭派，你有什麼回應？」，惹來哄堂大笑，何桂藍邊笑着邊舉起交叉手勢；黃之鋒、袁嘉蔚、吳敏兒及譚凱邦均大笑。趙回應：「我諗在場嘅反應都已經覺得好詫異，我自己都覺得好詫異」，林卓廷聞言問：「唔係啩？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙一度稱帖文僅限朋友閱讀-林卓廷地球post嚟㗎喎&quot;&gt;趙一度稱帖文僅限朋友閱讀 林卓廷：地球post嚟㗎喎&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，「法官閣下我回想緊，係咪可能人有情緒，當時政局嘅情緒係躁動嘅」。陳慶偉指着帖文的情緒表達功能提及：「覺得盛怒（furious）」，並問「你當時覺得盛怒？，你是說這帖文並非你的原本性格（out of character）？」，趙回應：「我記得我自己嘅個人 Facebook account，只係局限於朋友嘅連結先睇到」，余慧明和何桂藍發笑，林卓廷說「地球 post 嚟㗎喎」，延伸庭的黃之鋒亦面露驚訝地指着螢幕與其他人討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉問其意思是否指只限內部圈子（inner circle）才能看到。惟 Beel 打斷，指雖然他不是專家，但帖文有標記顯示是公開帖文，此時林卓廷和延伸庭的黃之鋒、袁嘉蔚、吳敏兒及朱凱迪等均大笑，余慧明一度掩眼。趙家賢未有回答，陳慶偉追問：「你有回應嗎？抑或你想午飯後才回答？」趙最後表示：「其實我無掂個電話好耐。」Beel 最後指出，「對抗暴政」及「光復議會」均是趙家賢和民主動力的政治立場，趙答「不同意」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙主動稱個腦嘅memory用晒喺案情-休息後回想為何有自己不會寫的帖文&quot;&gt;趙主動稱「個腦嘅memory用晒喺案情」 休息後回想為何有自己不會寫的帖文&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢於下午盤問期間，突然就有關帖文主動作出解釋，他稱：「因為當時我其實個腦嘅思考，只係就返本身喺法庭處理案情嘅一啲資料，包括民主動力嘅 Facebook⋯」，陳仲衡打斷並要求展示帖文。趙續指：「我確認頭先嗰個係我 Facebook 嘅 account 啦，但係辯方律師所展示畀我睇嘅嗰兩個貼文，我真係完全睇完之後冇印象，所以我睇完之後我係唔識答嘅」，他強調：「因為我本身個腦嘅 memory（記憶），就用晒喺案情本身嘅資料當中，咁所以經過稍作休息之後我回想返，點解會有啲自己唔會咁樣寫嘅 post 喺度呢？」林卓廷和鄒家成等失笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱被深黃居民網上欺凌19年助疏散太古站抗爭者卻被指送人頭&quot;&gt;趙稱被深黃居民網上欺凌、19年助疏散太古站抗爭者卻被指「送人頭」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙又指，現時回想，其個人 Facebook 帳戶除了自己私人用之外，「作為議員，都有陣時會認識到一啲區內嘅居民，都會加做朋友嘅。」他憶述2018年起被加在太古城、康怡及康山居民的「太古人太古事」Facebook 群組中，並不時會交流。但他其後發現，「我經常係畀一啲好深黃、或者係好本土意識嘅居民，就越嚟越有啲不禮貌或者係網上 bullying（欺凌）嘅情況。」延伸庭的黃之鋒、吳敏兒及朱凱迪大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，尤其是2019年8月11日，警方在太古站追捕抗爭者，並發射胡椒球彈，趙當時見站內多人，於是指示他們往某些出口疏散。但其後網上、連登及「太古人太古事」群組之中，有深黃居民及網民指控他，「話我叫啲人上咗地面之後，就即刻畀警察拉咗啦，喺度話我『送人頭』。」趙強調：「但係事實上呢，嗰啲示威者、抗爭者喺太古站上咗地面，就繼續喺電車站整路障堵路，過咗15分鐘之後啲警察先至到現場作執法行動」，這時黃之鋒驚訝地：「嘩！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱耳朵被咬後遭網民斥抵死-遂聘請價值觀較本土太古城居民&quot;&gt;趙稱耳朵被咬後遭網民斥抵死 遂聘請價值觀較本土太古城居民&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰打斷稱：「我不是不尊重你，但你可否用關鍵詞語總結？」被告席傳來笑聲。李續指：「我們對於那件事不感興趣，只是想知道為何你會發出此帖文，你是否想表達你的 Facebook 被入侵（hack）？」趙急忙表示：「法官閣下，知道！盡快，好快！」多人發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，該件事後，就算到了他的耳朵被咬受襲，「都繼續有呢啲深黃、本土嘅網民就繼續話我『抵死㗎！因為佢送人頭呀！』」，趙激動稱：「我當時真係完全唔明網上世界到底做乜鬼嘅！」被告席再度傳來笑聲。趙表示，因此其議辦聘請了太古城居民，是「價值觀相對較本土嘅21歲大學畢業生」。這時有被告驚訝地發出「嘩！」的聲音，亦有人說「又唔係佢？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙重申對帖文真係完全無任何印象由他人代發&quot;&gt;趙重申對帖文「真係完全無任何印象」、由他人代發&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉打斷，故簡言之，趙聘請的這人就是帖文的作者？趙稱：「應該係，因為嗰兩個帖文我真係完全無任何印象」，不少被告面露詫異。趙亦同意陳指，該名居民可登入其 Facebook。李運騰則問到，帖文使用口語而非書面語，與趙的慣常做法有否不同，他稱：「唔太一致。」有被告不禁發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉最後問：「請原諒我，所以帖文提及『覺得盛怒』，你是指這個並非你的感受，而是你助理的感受嗎？」多名被告和旁聽人士發笑，黃之鋒及袁嘉蔚均掩嘴大笑，吳敏兒亦發笑。趙解釋發文時可以選擇以什麼圖像表達感覺，重申「所以我完全冇任何印象係我整呢啲貼文出嚟。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 其後一度問，為何趙不刪除，惟陳慶偉不批准發問，Beel 再指，他的說法是「胡扯（nonsense）」，陳稱應留待陳詞交代。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方引民動工作報告-趙家賢曾獲民主黨通過出選區一&quot;&gt;辯方引民動工作報告 趙家賢曾獲民主黨通過出選「區一」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，辯方亦就「區議會（第一）功能組別」發問。Beel 展示民主動力工作報告，當中2020年7月23日的「民主動力召集人趙家賢就出選立法會區議會（第一）功能組別之聲明」，提及民主黨於前一日曾舉行黨內議員討論會，就趙家賢的提名及黨應否派員出選立法會區議會（第一）功能界別進行投票，最終，「趙個人信任票獲得通過，但黨內就應否派代表出選未有明顯共識，中委會授權的小組在參考黨內議員投票意向後作出決定，民主黨將不會派員出選區（一），召集人趙家賢感謝一眾黨友、政界友好，太古城社區及香港市民的信任，鼓勵及支持本人出戰立會，趙家賢會繼續堅守崗位，為香港搏盡。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問，在立法會選舉宣布延期前，趙是否願意成為「35+」候選人之一？法官李運騰打斷，指「區議會（第二）功能組別（超級區議會）」與「區議會（第一）功能組別」完全不同。Beel 再問無論如何，趙是獨立參選抑或參與「35+計劃」？趙回應因他是民主黨黨員，故想出選要先尋求黨內通過；而雖然通過了黨內信任票，但就民主黨應否參與該界別選舉，則不獲通過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指民主黨不派員出選區一-因有人認為已被攻擊得好犀利應支持工黨&quot;&gt;趙指民主黨不派員出選「區一」 因有人認為已被攻擊得「好犀利」、應支持工黨&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙在法官李運騰詢問下解釋，「區一」是由全港區議員互選產生的立法會議員議席，「區二」則需先獲足夠民選區議員提名，再開放予全港選民投票。被問民主黨為何不派人出選「區一」，趙指他並非民主黨中央委員，不清楚他們的討論，但在投票前的交流會上，李永達太太、屯門區議會主席陳樹英曾向黨友游說指「我支持家賢係一個好好嘅議員」，但認為就當時政局或應支持友黨「工黨」派人出選，因工黨當時議席已很少。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙指「呢個就係我自己作為黨員聽落去覺得好詫異嘅一樣嘢」，又指當時有部分黨友和同事認為，因「民主黨嘅保守溫和嘅取態已經畀本土抗爭派攻擊得好犀利」，若在選舉中嘗試爭取更多議席，反會影響地區直選的選情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方問區一是否屬35計劃-趙從來未曾提過&quot;&gt;辯方問「區一」是否屬「35+計劃」 趙：從來未曾提過&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，那「區一」是否包括在「35+計劃」內？趙指「從來未曾提過」。李續指，趙家賢接受了黨內提名他參選「區一」，那他是否有意作為候選人參加「35+」？趙未有直接回答，僅指他作為民動召集人，因曾做區議會選舉協調工作，認識港九新界各區很多議員，而因為該崗位，他是合適參與區議員業界代表的議席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李再追問，即與「35+計劃」有關嗎？趙指「我只可以講如果選得到嘅話，咪會喺立法會裡面民主派就會多一個席位，但就同返本案講緊嘅35+項目、『35+計劃』呢個 project 就唔係嗰回事」，此時林卓廷笑着望向鄒家成，施德來搖頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;被問區一是否計算35目標議席內-趙稱視乎計法&quot;&gt;被問「區一」是否計算「35+」目標議席內 趙稱視乎計法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問及「35+」的目標議席，趙同意「6 6 4 4 3」是地方選區目標，功能組別則需取得13席。Beel 問，趙意思是功能組別的目標議席並沒有計算「區一」在內？趙答：「睇吓唔同計法，可能有啲講法計，有啲講法唔計」，林卓廷說「嘩」。Beel 再問即是否包括「區一」，趙沒有直接回答，指「淨係好記得講傳統功能組別」，如會計界、法律界、IT界、社會福利界和一些想爭取的新界別，如發零售界和進出口界，陳志全發笑。趙續指：「我只可以講我唔能夠確認佢有冇特別去提包括埋呢個『區議會一』呢個組別。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡問，但考慮到2019年民主派在區議會選舉大勝，幾乎可以肯定民主派會贏得「區一」議席？趙指「係，冇錯法官閣下，個數據上係咁」，並指因此該聲明發出後一兩日，大約有7個民主派區議員進行交流會，想參選「區一」。李運騰問，與「35+」有關嗎？趙指：「法官閣下，喺我個思維係冇嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;小休期間，法庭職員稱由於有被告不適，因此案件押後至明天繼續，最後提早於3時50分散庭。據了解是何桂藍感到不適。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/eKepagT.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（19日）踏入審訊第46天。趙家賢今接受代表何桂藍的大狀盤問，形容與戴耀廷的關係「好複雜」，「絕對不會」視對方為親密朋友，又認為戴為他的工作製造很多困難，一度同意感覺他是「麻煩製造者」。被問趙是否對戴感到不滿，怪責戴令他有今時今日的困境，趙起初稱沒有怪責，指自己作供只是為協助法庭處理案件；但在法官追問下承認「當然我係一個人啦，係有情緒嘅」、「對於戴耀廷嘅感覺係有嘅」，承認對戴有感到不滿，才會稱呼他為「大思想家、大學者」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，趙家賢指何桂藍2018年在九西和新東補選初選後曾以《立場新聞》記者身分邀約他受訪，惟因趙感覺何「唔係好支持個初選」，故向《立場》反映望換人，終由另一記者訪問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱何桂藍2018年曾以立場記者身分就初選約訪-惟趙提出換人&quot;&gt;趙稱何桂藍2018年曾以《立場》記者身分就初選約訪 惟趙提出換人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢今開始接受代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 盤問。趙家賢同意，他個人並不認識何桂藍。被問是否從沒有與她談話，趙指在2018年頭，民主派九龍西和新界東補選初選完結後，何桂藍曾以《立場新聞》記者身分在某個集會「嚟搵我講咗幾句」，想就初選與他進行訪問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟趙指，當時何予他的感覺「其實唔係好支持個初選」，故他與《立場》另一名資深記者反映「如果你哋想訪問我，可唔可以派另一個記者嚟」，林卓廷、鄒家成、余慧明等發笑，何桂藍則沒有特別反應，繼續使用電腦。趙續指，故當時與何「傾咗幾下後就冇接觸」，《立場》亦派了另一個記者與他做訪問，此外便不曾與何有接觸和對話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指絕對不會視戴耀廷為親密朋友戴令其工作變得困難&quot;&gt;趙指絕對不會視戴耀廷為親密朋友、戴令其工作變得困難&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續就戴耀廷發問。趙同意，他於2012年開始認識戴耀廷。Beel 問他會如何形容與戴自2016年至2019年的關係，趙答「好複雜」。在延伸庭的黃之鋒、吳敏兒及袁嘉蔚均發笑。Beel 問，會否視戴為親密朋友（close friend）？趙指「絕對不會」。吳敏兒及袁嘉蔚聞後再發笑。Beel 再問，趙尊重戴嗎？法官李運騰問是作為人、學者抑或領袖？陳慶偉提議是作為政治人物，Beel 則指是作為政治思想家（political thinker）。趙未有直接回答，僅稱「（戴耀廷）諗好多嘢出嚟，係令到我當時嘅工作好困擾」，施德來、陳志全、鄒家成等發笑；吳敏兒及袁嘉蔚則笑得掩嘴。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，那趙會認為戴是麻煩製造者（troublemaker）嗎？趙答：「回應法官閣下，有呢個感覺」，被告席傳來笑聲。陳慶偉續指，但趙指戴是「麻煩製造者」，是現時回溯，抑或就當時與戴工作已有此感覺？趙指是當時已有此感覺，又指今時今日回顧，事實上很多戴耀廷倡議推動的事情，「大家有目共睹。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉問是指好的抑或壞的事？趙指就他工作而言，「就算啲嘢可能係好，但係喺執行上方面，整個民主派幫手去推動嘅時候呢，其實係好大嘅工作量，好麻煩嘅事情需要處理。」陳仲衡續說，因此戴只是令事情變得困難，而非「麻煩製造者」，趙續指「冇話佢係搞事」，但戴為他工作製造很多困難亦是事實。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指沒有怪責戴耀廷-惟在法官追問下承認有不滿才稱之為大思想家&quot;&gt;趙指沒有怪責戴耀廷 惟在法官追問下承認有不滿才稱之為「大思想家」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，趙退出初選工作後，是否開始對戴耀廷感到不滿（resentment）？趙同意。Beel 再指，趙事實上是怪責戴耀廷令他有今時今日的困境？趙答「我冇一個怪責嘅情況，因為我今日喺法庭呢度去作證，係為咗協助法庭去更加理解案情去處理案件」，其角色就是盡量就他所知的情況為法庭提供協助。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，那趙會認為若沒有戴耀廷2020年的計劃，他就不會落得今天的境況嗎？趙答：「回應法官閣下，呢個都係一個發生咗嘅事實嚟，所以我都要就住我當時係有錯誤嘅判斷，而冇做好一啲盡職審查、謹慎責任等等呢，我要承擔呢個責任。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李指他問的是趙的感受，問他每當想起這件事時，會否一直出現是戴耀廷導致他有今天遭遇的念頭？趙答：「回應法官閣下，當然我係一個人啦，係有情緒嘅」，舉例早前被問五大訴求內容時，他談及「撤回暴動定性」是「停頓咗一段係令人疑問嘅時間」，「因為一諗起衝突嘅場面，我喺個腦海即刻閃過我喺2019年11月3日太古城衝突，因為調停糾紛、保護市民受襲而被咬去左耳嘅片段，而我當時其實嗰吓係，我呆咗就係因為諗返起個畫面。」延伸庭的黃之鋒和吳敏兒發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，因此當他回想起整個初選和之後出問題等，「對於戴耀廷嘅感覺係有嘅」，並指由2012年開始認識戴並知道其工作模式，「叫做一隻手掌拍唔響」，而在整個香港民主運動政制發展的流程，加上2019年反修例運動後整個氣氛，在很多不同因素下，2020年「大家係好雄心壯志同好憤慨嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 打斷趙，指已拉得太遠，着他直接回答問題，趙指「我其實就係去到呢句就開始答啦」，多人發笑。李運騰指，簡而言之，趙是否對戴耀廷有不滿？趙點頭，李再指，因此趙才會稱呼戴是「大思想家、大學者」？趙再點頭答「係有嘅」。黃之鋒及吳敏兒不禁發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指對區諾軒絕對沒有像對戴耀廷的不滿&quot;&gt;趙指對區諾軒「絕對沒有」像對戴耀廷的不滿&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問及區諾軒，趙同意於2020年前已認識區諾軒。被問他們是否朋友，趙指與區工作上有良好的溝通交流，但沒特別私交。Beel 問，即使二人在2020年計劃合作，也沒有變成朋友？趙指「呢個要睇吓辯方律師定性朋友個定義係去到邊個程度」。Beel 舉例，像是一起飲酒和談足球？趟笑指「我記得就係未試過」。Beel 問，那趙對區諾軒有沒有對戴耀廷一樣的不滿？趙答：「絕對沒有。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/aeY85Pt.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（19日）踏入審訊第46天。趙家賢續接受代表何桂藍的大狀盤問，他曾多次強調民主動力於2020年5月中下旬才答應承辦初選，惟辯方質疑趙實早於2月已答應，因此才會出席各區協調會議，趙反問：「辯方大狀係咪想喺我個腦度植入一啲唔屬於我嘅認知？」，後稱「絕對不同意」；又重申雖與戴耀廷有意見分歧，但礙於當時社會氣氛而答應承辦初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉又問及「本土派」和「抗爭派」的分別，一度問前者是否認為政策應由本地人、而非由「北方的某些人」決定，趙同意，並指後者於初選後始出現，同意他們反政府並「擺明係隊到行」。此外，辯方亦提及威脅否決預算案是唯一可與政府談判的方法，惟趙不同意，強調立會過半是很重要的民意授權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱戴耀廷諗好多計劃so-called推動民主&quot;&gt;趙稱戴耀廷「諗好多計劃，so-called推動民主」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢續接受代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 盤問。Beel 引趙家賢早前提及，戴耀廷於2020年開始成為「較進步（progressive）」民主派人士的領袖，問他指「較進步」是甚麼意思。趙表示，比起當時政局及傳統民主派推動的工作，戴會「諗好多一啲計劃、一啲諗法，去 so-called（所謂）推動民主」，同意法官陳仲衡指例如佔領中環。Beel 再追問趙所指的「較進步」民主派是哪類人士？趙思考一會，指是在公民社會內對戴思維看法較支持或認同的人，指尤其佔中後催生了很多「傘後組織」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱2019年區選當選人較激進令區會未能暢順運作戴耀廷有相當大程度影響&quot;&gt;趙稱2019年區選當選人較激進令區會未能暢順運作、戴耀廷有「相當大程度影響」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙同意，戴在2018至2019年已望對抗政府，但趙不同意其主張；而2019年的區議會選舉中，民主動力與戴耀廷在揀選候選人方面有衝突。趙又確認，2019年區選的新當選議員較激進，反對社區撥款和令議會變得口號式，並指部分本土抗爭派及政治素人的激進不理性行為，令很多區議會事情未能暢順運作。惟趙強調，他亦認識不少「溫和本土派」，及「好實幹嘅政治素人」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問到，區議會之所以有新趨勢，是否源於戴耀廷所給予的資源或影響？趙先表示想作更正，指戴的風雲計劃應於2017年（趙主問稱2018年）開始，即使他找到的「風雲戰士」人數不是太多，但戴自2017年已就2019年的區議會選舉「有好多佢一啲諗法同倡議」，並令事情「有機發展落去」。Beel 打斷，再問區議會的新趨勢是否受到戴耀廷的影響，趙回應：「佢係有相當大嘅程度影響。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱本土派與抗爭派有別-前者認為政策應由港人決定未去到講港獨&quot;&gt;趙稱本土派與抗爭派有別 前者認為政策應由港人決定、「未去到講港獨」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問趙所指的「較進步」民主派，是否與傳統民主派不同，主控周天行質疑他問哪範疇；法官李運騰則改問傳統民主派與本土派是否這麼容易被識別，因趙早前提及民主派當中都有不同光譜。趙同意，重申「本土派都有溫和風格嘅人、政治素人都有好多務實做嘢嘅人」，亦指要說清楚，他提及的是「本土派」，非「本土抗爭派」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在陳慶偉要求下，趙解釋兩者的分別，指本土派主張「香港好多政策，係應該着重於喺香港特別行政區境內嘅事情」。陳慶偉問，是否指政策應該由本地人決定，而非由「身處北方的某些人（somebody else in the north）」決定？趙同意，亦補充本土派很着重本土文化及價值觀，及提倡文化保育。陳仲衡問，即是該些政策和價值觀是為了香港、亦由香港人制定的？趙同意。陳慶偉續問，本土派的主張亦包括香港獨立嗎？趙稱一般本土派「就未會去到有呢個講港獨嘅倡議或者思維」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指抗爭派擺明係隊到行認為傳統民主派無進寸&quot;&gt;趙指抗爭派「擺明係隊到行」、認為傳統民主派無進寸&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到「抗爭派」的倡議，趙指是於初選開始後才比較上提出和建立此派系。陳問他們倡議甚麼，是否反政府或對抗政府？趙稱就對現有體制及對政府的壓力方面，「大致上都係咁嘅意思」，因為他們覺得「現有嘅政府、政權，並唔係做緊一啲措施係照顧或者重視香港人」，同時亦覺得傳統民主派在香港三十多年，都沒有甚麼民主的進寸。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉問到，那「本土抗爭派」的意思是否即將「本土派」與「抗爭派」兩者的政治理念結合，即分別是倡議本土政策及反政府？趙同意。被問及是否可同時屬兩派，趙表示「個光譜係好闊嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 並指趙稱民主派分為傳統民主派、進步派、本土派、抗爭派，那「進步派」的主張又是甚麼？趙解釋：「其實好簡單，佢哋喺個光譜嘅位置就係比起傳統民主派冇咁溫和保守，但係佢哋又唔會好似抗爭派咁樣，擺明係隊到行」。被問區諾軒是屬於哪一陣營，趙指他是傳統民主派出身，亦曾為民主黨成員，但其政治思維比傳統民主派相對進步。法官李運騰最後提醒，裁決並非根據被告所屬的陣營、而是根據他們的言行決定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方問與戴耀廷意見分歧為何仍答應辦初選-趙指礙於社會氣氛&quot;&gt;辯方問與戴耀廷意見分歧為何仍答應辦初選 趙指礙於社會氣氛&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續就趙家賢與民主動力承辦初選發問。趙表示，戴於2019年12月撰文談立會過半，並慢慢開始提倡運用憲制權力和「35+」的想法，惟因他當時耳朵受襲需休養，故沒有與戴辯論如何醞釀立會過半，指戴之後「加插咗好多嘢落去」，同意並不認同其文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續指，既然趙與戴耀廷有意見分歧，又認為2019年區選後由較激進者當選，加上2020年頭民主動力正進行選民登記活動，為何當時仍答應戴承辦初選？趙一度指已曾回答法官問及的相關問題，其後再解釋「礙於當時整個社會嘅氣氛係要求有初選」，即市民望選民主派入議會反映民意、「唔好再自己打自己浪費選票」，加上各大政黨亦支持參與初選，故即使他知道「同戴耀廷嘅工作嘅情況係唔理想」，他在諮詢民動副召集人後，「就因為作為民主陣營嘅一分子，希望可以付出到」，故答應承辦初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問，所謂社會要求有初選是指市民抑或民主派領袖？趙指廣義而言市民希望民主陣營「唔好鬼打鬼」，而進行協調後，參與者同意以初選解決爭議和集中票源。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/73c4aG4.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
▲ 前排：趙家賢（左）、戴耀廷（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指民動出席協調會因已是組織者-趙反問係咪想喺我個腦植入唔屬於我嘅認知&quot;&gt;辯方指民動出席協調會因已是組織者 趙反問：係咪想喺我個腦植入唔屬於我嘅認知？&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問民主動力在初選的角色是否提供建議，趙同意當時獲邀列席會議是因民動有辦補選初選的經驗，可就此作分享助大家了解。趙又同意，民動總幹事黎敬輝在場抄寫筆記，而趙本人沒有出席部分會議，有出席的也遲到、早走、或以電腦處理區議會事務，而會上大致上是由戴耀廷發言。Beel 問，看起來其實不需要民主動力在場？趙靜默約5秒後抬頭：「想問辯方律師想我點答？」林卓廷和鄒家成均說「吓」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指，趙其實是受邀出席，而非主動提出想參與，趙同意，並同意黎敬輝或其他兼職同事會代表民動出席會議。Beel 問，既然他們在場，趙家賢為何需到場？趙指因民主動力獲得邀請，而在一些協調會議開始時，「以隆重其事，作為組織嘅召集人，點樣都要到一到。」Beel 問，民動是想變成有用的角色？趙重申民動是獲邀出席，而作為民主陣營中「咁多人參與嘅事情」，民動獲邀就當然希望「喺件事當中、個會議當中，係有參與」，盡量看看有什麼就初選的意見可提供或幫手。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，民動當時出席會議，是因為當時已經是初選組織者？趙指之前已提及，民動是5月中下旬才確認承辦初選。惟 Beel 指，趙所說的全屬虛構、並非事實，事實上他在2月已經答應辦初選，因此才會出席協調會議。趙望着 Beel 反問：「辯方大狀係咪想喺我個腦度植入一啲唔屬於我嘅認知？」庭上傳來笑聲，林卓廷、吳政亨等紛紛說「嘩」。陳慶偉指趙可直接說不同意，趙再答：「絕對不同意。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指支持五大訴求-惟反對以否決財案迫政府回應&quot;&gt;趙指支持五大訴求 惟反對以否決財案迫政府回應&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 亦問及趙家賢的立場，問他是否支持五大訴求？趙未有正面回答，指「當時係整個民主陣營嘅光譜都會係知道民間有呢個五大訴求」。Beel 指是問趙的立場，他續答「支持」。法官陳仲衡續指，即使支持五大訴求，就如何爭取也有不同意見、有很廣闊的光譜，趙同意指「絕對係」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，他是否支持透過否決預算案迫使政府回應五大訴求？趙指「我反對嘅」，至於以否決財案迫政府落實普選，趙也反對。被問是否支持就警暴成立調查委員會，趙指他支持由大法官成立調查委員會，就反修例運動起源和後續衝突作獨立調查；至於是否支持特赦抗爭者，趙指會稱之為「撤銷檢控」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指威脅否決財案為唯一談判方法-趙不同意-堅稱立會過半可獲民意授權&quot;&gt;辯方指威脅否決財案為唯一談判方法 趙不同意 堅稱立會過半可獲「民意授權」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙曾供稱，如立會過半可推動利民政策，他在盤問下解釋是指提出私人草案以及要求政府回應的動議。Beel 續指，但即使有立會過半，仍會因分組點票而令可通過的政策非常少。趙指立法會投票的確如此運作，但廣義上大家會認同議席若過半，民意授權的能力便會大增，與政府討論時亦更有力量爭取民主陣營倡議的政策。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙亦曾提及，立會過半的目標包括讓政府回應五大訴求。Beel 問如何令政府回應？趙重申當有民意授權時，「正常嘅政府係應該要重視而去回應」，惟當時政府好像完全無就五大訴求作回應，亦沒有就當中要求作清楚解說。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡續問，但事實上即使有「35+」，泛民也會因分組點票而不能通過落實五大訴求的議案？趙再指立會投票制度當然有「局限性」，但重申立會過半是很重要的民意授權，而他雖從未曾任立會議員，但作為民主派一員，亦望其代表入立會後運用他們的權力與政府商討。他又強調，具體如何進行，「我相信立法會議員佢哋獲得民意授權，佢哋有個自主性去處理。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 指出，事實上唯一可以與政府談判的方法，就是威脅否決預算案，「沒有其他有效的機制」？趙說：「Disagree.」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/R5qhRRk.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（19日）踏入審訊第46天。趙家賢繼續接受代表何桂藍的大狀盤問，指戴耀廷曾望民主動力捐眾籌的80至100萬予香港民研，以建立新的投票系統就否決財案向泛民施壓，惟趙終僅建議捐40萬，解釋因不想與戴的計劃有任何牽連，但戴又「不斷咁樣催住我、追問住我」令他「好煩擾」，故「搵一個中間位，叫做可以將件事情推走咗」，又指可令戴「唔使對外講話民主動力食晒啲錢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就民主動力帖文出現「對抗暴政」等字眼，趙指相信撰文的總幹事黎敬輝是迎合當時社會氣氛和民主陣營聲音。辯方追問趙是否支持「對抗暴政」，法官李運騰一度笑言「怎會有人公然說自己支持暴政呢？」，趙終指他不會說「對抗暴政」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱蘋果記者以半個朋友身份關心他-對戴耀廷攬炒一文感好詫異&quot;&gt;趙稱《蘋果》記者以半個朋友身份關心他 對戴耀廷「攬炒」一文感好詫異&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢續接受代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 盤問。他確認，曾向警方國安處錄取4份口供，分別於2022年9月29日、2023年1月10日及21日，及同年3月21日。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方就趙退出初選的情況發問。趙曾供稱，於2020年7月14日獲《蘋果日報》政治版資深女記者轉發戴耀廷〈真攬炒十步〉一文，並提醒他小心，他才首次閱畢該文章。Beel 問到，此前趙有沒有留意到戴於3至5月撰寫的文章？趙指協調會議上有人曾提出支持戴的文章，戴遂講解。趙續補充，當時該名女記者亦轉發《文匯報》和《大公報》相關報導，着他留意建制派批評。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問到，該記者當時並非訪問他，只是純粹來警告他？趙表示於2004年認識她，「喺工作上同埋叫做有半個朋友身份嘅角色，佢聯絡我係出於朋友嘅關心同擔憂。」趙續指，以該記者「做咗咁耐傳媒專業嚟講，佢係會覺得好有問題」，而她雖很資深，亦因工作量太多，「佢自己都根本冇為意戴耀廷當時有篇咁嘅文章寫咗出嚟，所以佢自己知道嘅時候都好詫異。」說畢有人大聲嘆氣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指趙家賢退出非因戴耀廷文章-趙不同意&quot;&gt;辯方指趙家賢退出非因戴耀廷文章 趙不同意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙同意，區諾軒並無與他討論該篇文章，而助手黎敬輝、民主動力其他職員、區議會同事和朋友亦無叫他留意該文。Beel 向趙指出，事實上他一直都知道這篇文章，並了解戴耀廷以《基本法》權力否決預算案的看法；而趙決定退出初選，並不是因為《蘋果》記者的提醒和戴耀廷的文章，趙不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據民主動力2020年10月的會議記錄，趙曾於會上稱退出協調是因國務院及港澳辦譴責初選。法官李運騰續問，趙退出是因受官方譴責？趙回應退出的決定「其實係幾日嘅時間」，先是7月13晚記者會後，得悉戴不知道初選有否違大陸法，至翌日《蘋果》記者提醒他文章的重大問題，再加上區諾軒致電稱會退出初選，故趙同意區先退出，他再在「適當時機」退出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指抗爭派記者會事項與協調會議事項大致相同-趙不同意&quot;&gt;辯方指抗爭派記者會事項與協調會議事項大致相同 趙不同意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙同意兩辦和國務院的譴責亦是他退出的原因之一，因認為「已經唔係香港嘅事件，係提升到國家層面嘅事情」。他最後補充，本土抗爭派於15日的記者會令他有「好特別嘅思想轉變」，知道民主動力和他一定要盡快與整個初選切割。Beel 指，抗爭派記者會上提出的事項其實與協調會議上提出的事項大致相同？趙稱「不太同意」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱戴耀廷不斷催促感好煩擾-故建議捐40萬予民研-搵中間位將件事推走&quot;&gt;趙稱戴耀廷不斷催促感「好煩擾」 故建議捐40萬予民研 「搵中間位將件事推走」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續就民主動力對香港民意研究所的捐款發問。根據民動會議紀錄，趙曾建議將眾籌剩餘的40萬捐予香港民研。趙解釋因雙方原本簽約於官方選舉前進行大型民調，因選舉延期才無生效，故認為「有呢個責任叫做係捐一筆錢畀香港民研」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，戴耀廷另曾稱望民動捐80至100萬予民研建立新的民意收集系統，以在民主派於否決預算案有顧慮時收集民意指示。但趙強調「絕對唔想我同民主動力就住戴耀廷所諗嘅計劃有任何牽連」，因覺得就《國安法》有很高風險，惟「我係唔識得向戴耀廷 say no」，因此與執委會決定無條件捐一筆數額不足以開新項目的款項予民研，強調「咁就令到佢（戴耀廷）唔駛對外講話『民主動力食晒啲錢』，又或者成日追住我要啲錢去做一啲佢唔同諗法嘅項目」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問，會議是2020年10月的事，即趙到了當時仍按戴耀廷的說話來做？但陳慶偉打斷，先問該40萬捐款是趙還是戴的主意。趙回應：「係我基於戴耀廷不斷咁樣催住我、追問住我底下，我覺得好煩擾、好想迴避嘅狀態下，而我諗嘅一個建議出嚟。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙同意陳仲衡所指，戴是希望趙捐大筆款項予民研，而他則決定無條件捐較小金額。陳續問，趙會否視自己是跟隨戴的想法？趙指：「我唔會話係跟隨，我會覺得係搵一個中間位，叫做可以將件事情推走咗」，陳續問：「是作為調解員角色？」，但陳慶偉打斷指是時候小休。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢同意因選舉延期-戴耀廷才提出望以民調向泛民就否決財案施壓&quot;&gt;趙家賢同意因選舉延期 戴耀廷才提出望以民調向泛民就否決財案施壓&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就趙家賢提及的兩個民調，趙解釋選前民調可得知候選人支持度，並透過數據類比調整選舉策略。他以新東「6+1」的目標為例，如民調顯示民主陣營票數或超過7席，便需透過宣傳分配選票，如叫支持度最高的首兩個團隊支持者投票予第7位團隊；亦可着第7至8位團隊合作，擇其一做主打以確保「穩妥」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，若支持度不足以取得目標議席又如何處理？趙指戴透過以往選民投票數據估算出目標議席，加上當時市民對政府不滿，在「好熱切」氣氛下投票率會提升，故就支持度的估算即使不是100%但都十拿九穩，同意李運騰指當時「好大信心」地區直選拿到「6 6 4 4 3」議席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方問及民調顯示市民不支持否決財案情況-惟官稱結果不一定公布&quot;&gt;辯方問及民調顯示市民不支持否決財案情況 惟官稱結果不一定公布&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於有關向泛民施壓否決預算案的民調，李運騰問這是否「35+計劃」的一部分？並指以他理解，是因官方選舉延期，戴耀廷才提出進行此民調，陳仲衡亦同意。趙指兩位法官的理解正確，又重申戴是在8月底至9月頭向他提及望以此民調向民主派施壓。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問，若最後民調結果顯示，大部分市民不支持否決財政預算案，那當選人是否要遵守承諾？惟陳仲衡指，Beel 的說法是假設結果會向民主派公布。Beel 面露驚訝發笑，反問「為什麼他們不會知道？」，陳慶偉說「不一定」，陳仲衡亦指會否使用該民調或視乎結果。李運騰則指，若相關事項從沒被討論，就此發問並無意義，Beel 續就其他議題發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指黎敬輝草擬文件時想迎合傳統民主派及本土派&quot;&gt;趙指黎敬輝草擬文件時想迎合傳統民主派及本土派&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官早前曾質疑民主動力文件字眼，趙家賢稱由民動總幹事黎敬輝準備，向法官認錯。Beel 今就此發問，指趙曾形容黎敬輝很有責任心、對細節細心，那黎是否不會將個人意見放在民動的官方文件如工作報告，因那是不負責任的表現？趙指，不會說黎「帶自己嘅情緒擺入去」，而是「就住整個社會氣氛」，並指民主動力作為一個協調組織和交流平台，「我有時留意到佢幫手起草嘅文件、一啲用詞呢，係想迎合到傳統民主派，同埋係比較上進步甚至乎係本土派。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續提及，就民主動力2020年6月宣傳眾籌的帖文有「光復議會」、「對抗暴政」字眼，趙曾稱絕非民主動力政治立場；惟 Beel 指，黎敬輝作為職員一定會知道民動的政治立場。不過法官李運騰先問，民主動力事實上有沒有政治立場？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指民主動力角色僅行政支援-政治上無好清楚立場&quot;&gt;趙指民主動力角色僅行政支援 政治上無好清楚立場&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙指，他正想帶出民動並非一個政黨組織，而且自2002年成立以來的實務工作，就是協調傳統民主派內部糾紛或協作大型活動。他指從創會召集人得知，民主派立法會議員有「飯盒會」前，實由民主動力作為他們的「聯合統籌秘書處」；直至成立了「飯盒會」，民動的功能才交由議員處理。趙續指，民主動力在傳統民主派中擔任行政及支援角色，故政治上不會有「好特別出眾」或「好清楚」的立場，亦是迎合民主派需要而提供協助。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙在法官提問下重申，若由他發布帖文，會選擇刪去「光復議會」和「對抗暴政」，重申相信職員草擬時「有迎合到當時嘅社會氣氛」，因「民主陣營都有啲咁嘅聲音而加落去」。Beel 兩度問趙是否支持「對抗暴政」，趙指已回答若有檢視帖文，不會用該字眼，後又稱「我頭先已經回答咗個問題」。法官陳仲衡指，辯方並非問他會否在帖文用該句子，而是他是否支持該句話的意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 再次問趙是否支持「對抗暴政」，並在法官李運騰提醒下補充是指就香港的語境而言。李續笑言，若不補充該語境，問題是無意義的，「怎會有人公然說自己支持暴政呢？（“How can anyone say I openly support tyranny?”）」Beel 再問，趙是否會說這句句子，趙終答「不會」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方質疑趙將兩次新東會議混淆-趙不同意&quot;&gt;辯方質疑趙將兩次新東會議混淆 趙不同意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，就新東協調會議，趙曾供稱在4月14日的首次會議，鄒家成等曾就運用否決權字眼作爭論。Beel 指出，事實上與會者沒有就否決預算案作討論，包括使用「會運用」或「會積極運用」的字眼，趙不同意，並指曾經有討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續指，黎敬輝的會議筆記沒有提過與會者討論否決預算案，只提及戴耀廷有在會上提出。趙解釋，筆記記下戴的討論重點，而因當時鄒家成及民主黨代表莊榮輝就否決預算案用字有「好熾熱」的討論，他亦親眼目睹，因此着黎「唔使記錄啦，我都聽咗啦」，指「我都唔想佢要做得咁多嘅工作」。Beel 笑說「Really」，續向趙指，事實上他是將4月14日的首次會議，與他原先以為自己有出席的5月5日第二次會議混淆，趙不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示黎敬輝筆記時，趙亦指筆記顯示「慢必 蘇浩」是指陳志全和蘇浩均有出席當日會議，與區諾軒在盤問稱陳志全沒有出席兩次會議有出入。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙曾與戴討論否決財案獲回應大家去傾故無特別參與-不同意會上只達4共識&quot;&gt;趙曾與戴討論否決財案獲回應「大家去傾」故無特別參與 不同意會上只達4共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到既然趙家賢不同意否決預算案，他有否與區諾軒就此事與戴討論？趙思索約15秒後，指只記得曾向戴表達有關無差別否決、或着重運用權力否決預算案的事，當時戴回應指：「你睇吓喺個會度大家有唔同意見，咪大家去傾囉。」趙認為「咁我就變咗係等與會者自己去傾，我同民主動力嘅角色喺呢方面都唔特別參與啦」。趙同意陳慶偉所指，有將這件事向戴提及，而最後因與民動無關，故由戴自行向與會者周旋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，新東會上唯一達成的共識是否只是舉辦初選、替補機制、出選名單及辦選舉論壇4點，趙原答「冇錯」，但陳仲衡指辯方是問「只是」有上述4項共識，趙改稱「並不是」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明早續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（18日）踏入審訊第45天。趙家賢繼續接受代表黃碧雲及林卓廷的大狀盤問，就「墨落無悔」提及協調會議的共同綱領「已達致抗爭陣營光譜的最大公因數」，趙認為會上有意見拉扯，聲明卻似乎將所有與會者寫成「一個抗爭陣營」，向他人施壓。辯方亦指，聲明可見發起人亦意識到就否決預算案有「立場差異」，否則毋須向他人施壓，惟法官陳慶偉認為聲明提及「已取得共識的共同綱領」，顯示最終仍達成了共識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙又指，與會者「都好畀面戴耀廷」，戴就細微爭議提建議他們亦無異議；而黃碧雲及林卓廷就無差別否決預算案「無特別表態」，趙有出席的新東及九西首次會議均無就否決財案達共識，即使早前稱新東第二次會議投票通過「會運用」否決權，亦是非正式投票。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指會上就否決財案有意見拉扯-墨落無悔發起人望施壓如不簽聲明就非同陣營&quot;&gt;趙指會上就否決財案有意見拉扯 「墨落無悔」發起人望施壓：如不簽聲明就非同陣營&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢繼續接受代表林卓廷和黃碧雲的大律師沈士文盤問。辯方今展示鄒家成 Facebook 發布的「墨落無悔」聲明書，表示就當中認同「五大訴求，缺一不可」、及若支持度不足須表明停止選舉工程的條款，均沒有爭議；唯一有爭議的只是運用否決權，趙同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;聲明提及「我們認為，在初選協調會議上已取得共識的共同綱領，乃一眾參選人之合作基礎。考慮到立場差異，此一綱領已達致抗爭陣營光譜的最大公因數」。沈引「考慮到立場差異，此一綱領已達致抗爭陣營光譜的最大公因數」，問根據協調會議，相關「立場差異」是否指否決預算案的爭議？趙未有直接回答，指鄒是提及「抗爭陣營」而非「整個民主陣營」，並在法官澄清下，同意傳統民主派和抗爭派唯一的爭議，是有關否決預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈續指，事實上趙家賢並不會知道聲明中「抗爭陣營」一詞的實際所指，趙表示據他對聲明的理解，會上是有一些協議和基礎，但當中有立場差異；而聲明書的發起人認為他們的陣營就是「最大公因數」，聲明語境「就好似想將所有參與協調會議嘅都係一個抗爭陣營，而事實上喺當時大家仲有一啲不同意見嘅拉扯喺當中」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，即趙認為「抗爭陣營」是一個籠統的用法（general term）？趙指「法官閣下我唔可以咁 absolute 咁答」，並解釋其理解是發起人「想畀啲壓力啲人，如果你唔簽個聲明書呢，就唔係我哋同一個陣營嘅人啦」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指就否決預算案有立場差異-官強調已達成共識&quot;&gt;辯方指就否決預算案有「立場差異」 官強調已達成共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文續指，不論「抗爭陣營」一詞所指為何，但根據聲明書，就是他們就否決預算案有「立場差異」，而聲明發起者當時亦察覺到有此差異。惟法官陳慶偉不同意，指根據聲明中「我們認為⋯已取得共識的共同綱領」，不論「抗爭陣營」所指為何，「他們就運用否決權都似乎達成了共識」、發起人並不認為有「差異」，又着辯方應考慮前文後理，而非只抽取其中一句。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟沈指，無從得知已取得的「共識」是指什麼。陳慶偉指就是關於運用否決權。沈指句子沒有如此提及，陳再指「隨便你，你可以在陳詞說明，但你現在有困難」。沈指他一直都有困難，反指若已經取得共識，就無需寫聲明、也無需向他人施壓；惟陳再重申，不同陣營可能有不同意見，但最終還是達成了共識。沈終指會留待陳詞，沒有繼續發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續指，不是要說服沈士文，只是講出他個人的理解，沈重申他完全不同意，但會留待陳詞。李運騰亦指雖然法庭暫時看法不同，但仍願接受辯方說服（open to persuasion），又指重點其實是黃碧雲和林卓廷都沒有簽署「墨落無悔」。趙續在盤問下確認，二人均沒有簽署和認同「墨落無悔」，並同意二人提名表格均沒有提及否決預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 黃碧雲&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙認九西首次會議未就否決財案達共識惟協議初稿有相關條款無字眼顯示曾被討論&quot;&gt;趙認九西首次會議未就否決財案達共識惟協議初稿有相關條款、無字眼顯示曾被討論&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文續指，趙家賢曾提及戴耀廷有「亂咁嚟」的傾向，包括在「雷動計劃」未授權就賣廣告，及在民主動力未答應時已向與會者稱已邀請民動。沈續舉出其他戴「亂咁嚟」的例子，指趙曾供稱在九西首次會議，甚少談及否決預算案議題，亦因此沒有就此達成共識，但在會後不久，戴卻發出了「35+立會過半計劃 民主派九西協調機制（初稿）」，提及參與協調者認同「會積極運用立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈續展示文件，表示雖然是以「初稿」為題，但並沒有字眼顯示就否決預算案的段落曾被討論。主控萬德豪一度要求趙家賢避席，認為辯方提問方式不公，似乎暗示戴發出文件時沒提及目的，但事實上主問時已提及戴發出該文件時表明：「這是我草擬的文件，作下次會議討論的基礎。」惟法官李運騰認為看不到不公，指控方可以覆問，陳慶偉亦指辯方問題僅是指該份初稿從表面看來，似乎從來沒有被討論或將會被討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢其後返回法庭，沈士文再問，雖然文件以「初稿」為題，但就否決預算案的段落，是否沒有字眼顯示該部分曾被討論、或是要被參與者同意。趙同意，指整份文件的內容始終是草稿，沒有任何附註標明當中內容「係從邊度討論或收返嚟」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指新東未就7張名單參選達共識-惟協議稱首7張名單參選&quot;&gt;辯方指新東未就7張名單參選達共識 惟協議稱首7張名單參選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈續以新界東為例，展示民主動力總幹事黎敬輝就5月5日第二次新東會議的筆記，談及出選名單的情況：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Benny（戴耀廷）：如被DQ，靈童轉生；N+1，共7隊 可以有彈性，可以再傾&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;鄒家成：會否考慮初選後按形勢調整 N 定 N+1 或其他範圍外的隊伍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Benny：當初6+1，因為可能有7席，第7位的作用，可以於2/9民調後再傾&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;? : 初選後，再決定第7命運，如為攞到第7席，先再討論及宣傳&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙在盤問下表示，戴耀廷大方向是望保守獲6席，並望可多取一度獲7席，而據黎敬輝筆記，第7席的事宜會留待之後再討論和決定。惟沈續展示新界東的「final」文件「35+立會過半計劃 民主派新界東協調機制協議」，提及是「由首七張名單參與官方選舉，其他名單承諾不參與官方的選舉」，問是否絕不是新界東達成的共識？趙指根據助手筆記「就睇唔到一個好大嘅分別」。沈續指，惟根據筆記，其實並沒有就7張名單參選和其他名單不參選達成共識，趙答：「根據助手筆記就冇提及過呢樣嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方質疑衞生服務界無開會但戴耀廷照撰協議-趙引述戴稱曾與所有參選人個別商討&quot;&gt;辯方質疑衞生服務界無開會但戴耀廷照撰協議 趙引述戴稱曾與所有參選人個別商討&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文續以衞生服務界為例，指該界別沒有舉辦過任何協調會議，但戴卻草擬出一份協議。沈續展示戴6月8日於組織者群組發出的「35+計劃 民主派衞生服務界協調機制協議」文件，列明參與協調者認同「會積極運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈問到，趙是否不知道戴在沒有召開會議下，如何撰寫出這份協議？趙指不清楚，但提及由於衞生服務界沒有開協調會議，他曾問戴如何與相關參選人討論，戴告知他有與所有參選人個別聯絡溝通、仔細商討，趙形容猶如做「穿梭式調解（shuttle mediation）」，即不見面但通過調解員與持份者商討，在延伸庭的被告包括吳敏兒聞後發笑。趙續指他不太清楚商討內容，得知戴有與他們溝通後亦沒有再仔細追問。沈問到，但趙並不知道戴實質有沒有做到？趙思考數秒後回答：「我當時真誠地確信佢有做。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指衞生服務界勢力板塊轉變較進取派佔上風-倡辦初選推舉立法會代表&quot;&gt;趙指衞生服務界勢力板塊轉變、較進取派「佔上風」 倡辦初選推舉立法會代表&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙在法官詢問下，確認以其認知，衞生服務界從沒開過協調會議。李運騰續問，既然衞生服務界沒有舉辦任何協調會議或初選論壇，舉辦初選有什麼意義？趙回應指會「盡我所知協助法庭」，並指衞生服務界多年來均由民主派贏取議席，當時連任幾屆的議員為香港護士協會主席李國麟教授，「而本身香港護士協會係比較上支持民主，係好溫和務實嘅護士工會。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，過往在選委會選舉中，護士協會與護士業界獲一定比數議席，「叫做係業界係均衡嘅參與」；但2017年選委會選舉，一些較為「行得前少少、支持民主光譜嘅醫護界人士」贏取全部30席。趙續指，他們認為李國麟政見「太過溫和保守」，再加上2019年反修例運動後有新的醫管局工會成立，很多成員是衞生服務界選民，因此「當時喺功能組別裡面嘅勢力板塊，就開始有啲轉變」。李運騰指，即較進取（progressive）一派「佔上風」？趙同意，並指他們希望成為立法會代表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李追問那為何要舉辦初選，趙表示以其認知，因他們希望從支持民主觀念的候選人中「可以團結一致推一個候選人出嚟」。李問是誰的主意？趙稱「新興嘅衞生服務界團體好 vocal、好倡議應該要有呢個初選」，而「最重要就係當時現任議員李國麟教授都願意參與」。趙確認，李國麟終有參與初選，陳慶偉指記得他是「墊底」，趙同意，重申「業界裡面勢力板塊轉變」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙認無清晰制定如何達共識-稱不同民主派好畀面戴耀廷-戴提建議無異議&quot;&gt;趙認無清晰制定如何達共識 稱不同民主派「好畀面戴耀廷」 戴提建議無異議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈續向趙家賢指出辯方案情，並着他可答「同意」、「不同意」和「不知道」。沈先指，根據協調會議和文件，參與者被告知初選的初心是避免撞票和爭取最多議席，趙同意。沈續指，事實上就共識如何達成並沒有任何規則，惟趙家賢思考約20秒後指約只限於三個選項，「有啲唔係好答到。」辯方着他可隨意解釋，趙續指在整個過程，「我留意唔到係有一個正式嘅文件、或者係好清晰點樣制定到如何達致一個共識嘅做法」，而他觀察到不同光譜的民主陣營人士，在會議中「都好畀面戴耀廷、都對區諾軒好信任」，而在一些細微的爭議位，「戴耀廷可能用咗一啲做法、建議『咁樣做啦』，即場大家冇咩異議。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙在法官詢問下，確認並非所有出席會議的人士均有參與初選，亦非所有參與初選的人有出席會議。他並指戴耀廷起初是從傳媒、網絡又或親身得知有人有興趣參選，並會邀請他們出席會議，而會議人數沒有限制，首次新東會議便有約三四十人，包括候選人和義工等。林卓廷一度驚訝問「三、四十人？」，鄒家成向他點頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙同意新東第二次會議為非正式投票新東及九西首次協調會無就否決財案達共識&quot;&gt;趙同意新東第二次會議為非正式投票、新東及九西首次協調會無就否決財案達共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙早前據助手筆記稱，新東第二次會議投票通過「會運用」否決權。沈士文續指出，當時所謂的「投票」，實際上並非正式投票，只是讓與會者表達意見？趙同意，並指「如果係一個正式嘅投票，就會講明係正式投票」，若使用其他字眼「咁一定唔係正式投票」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈亦指出，新東及九西的協調會議，並沒有就否決預算案達成共識。主控周天行問是會議哪個階段，沈指是兩區最後一次協調會議之後，陳慶偉並補充是以趙個人所知，非由助手黎敬輝告知。趙思索約10秒後稱：「我個人嚟講係唔太確認有冇共識。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉指趙的回答有點勉強（reluctant），並追問原因，趙表示因自己沒有參與會議。陳指他可回答就他有出席的會議而言，即新東及九西首次會議是否沒有就否決財案達成共識？趙同意，指「因為佢哋係討論緊」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;被問黃碧雲及林卓廷有否同意或答應否決財案-趙無特別表態&quot;&gt;被問黃碧雲及林卓廷有否同意或答應否決財案 趙：無特別表態&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈最後指出，在整個35+計劃及初選中，黃碧雲及林卓廷從沒有同意或答應無差別否決預算案，趙思考約10秒後遭陳慶偉追問：「你是否知道？抑或你未能回答？」趙問：「沈大狀你可唔可以再問多次？」沈再重複問題，趙思考一輪後終稱：「喺我個人認知嚟講，佢哋冇特別就呢方面表態」，並指自己作為民主黨員，收到黨的訊息都沒有特別說明要否決預算案，只稱望參與初選減低票源衝撞，「所以我認知係佢哋無特別喺呢方面提及任何事情。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙於錄影會面稱何桂藍岑敖暉等vocal啲向溫和民主派施壓&quot;&gt;趙於錄影會面稱：何桂藍岑敖暉等「vocal啲」、向溫和民主派施壓&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;較早前沈向趙確認2021年6月29日首次警誡會面錄影的謄本內容，當中涉及趙在整個初選的心路歷程，長12頁，趙庭上以約6分鐘讀畢。被問是否確認會面內容，趙指就傳統民主派對否決財案「都好反對」，望改為「好有保留、好有顧慮」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡續指謄本中趙的發言有一個位置寫着「聽不清」，該句為：「鄒家成啦，王百羽啦，張可森啦，呢個叫做何桂藍啦，同埋呢仲有呢個嘅岑敖暉嘅，咁佢哋呢幾個就比較上，我哋叫做⋯（聽不清）喺一個嘅協調會議當中呢，係會同好多溫和民主派去辯論呀，即係去施壓，就係希望即係透過係用民意個道德高地⋯」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳提議播放有關片段作澄清，辯方亦問趙是否記得自己說過甚麼，趙指「我嘗試回想」，但不久後稱：「我回想返都唔係好記得我嗰句係講咩。」沈其後播放片段，趙確認他稱：「咁佢哋呢幾個就比較上，我哋叫做 vocal 啲」。沈士文表示完成盤問，下午將由代表施德來的大狀黃廷光盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（18日）踏入審訊第45天。趙家賢接受參選九龍東的施德來的大狀盤問，同意民協「好溫和務實」，而前民協主席施德來性格「好懂得尊重人」，即使民協作為傳統民主派「畀人好針對」亦會很有禮貌回應，「我未見過佢同其他人有嗰種黃毓民式嘅對鬧指罵。」而九東所有參選人報名時均夾附共同綱領，提及「會積極運用」否決權，趙確認戴曾指該份文件是基於他草擬的協議。辯方並指，施德來報名時原沒有夾附共同綱領，惟一兩日後獲民主動力職員來電要求提交，趙表示不知情，亦沒有指示職員作出此要求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢稱民協好溫和務實&quot;&gt;趙家賢稱民協「好溫和務實」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表林卓廷和黃碧雲的大狀沈士文早上完成盤問趙家賢，下午由代表施德來的大狀黃廷光繼續。趙在辯方盤問下確認，於2004年加入民主黨，至2020年已曾為從政者（politicians）16年。法官陳仲衡一度問他入黨的年紀，趙指是19歲，陳問他當時已叫自己為從政者？趙指該年紀當然不會，而自己是自2003年七一遊行後開始參與民主運動和社會服務工作，並於2005年在民主黨李柱銘和楊森的辦事處以社區顧問身份在太古城做地區工作，才開始視自己為從政者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙在盤問下，確認知道香港民主民生協進會（民協）這個政治團體。被問民協是否較溫和的政黨，趙指不論他在修讀社會科學時、還是其後參與香港政治圈子後的認知，民協在基層民生以及民主推動的工作上「都係好溫和務實」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱施德來好懂得尊重人未見過佢有黃毓民式嘅對鬧指罵&quot;&gt;趙稱施德來「好懂得尊重人」：未見過佢有黃毓民式嘅對鬧指罵&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙確認，於2016年底施德來任民協主席時認識他，並於2017年開始與施在協調選舉上有接觸，指施有代表民協出席民主動力召開的民主派地區協調會議，包括2019年區選協調會議，同意該些會議大約每3個月舉行一次。此時趙突然問黃廷光「唔好意思，大狀點稱呼㗎？」，黃答他姓「黃」，趙回答時續以「黃大狀」稱呼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續同意，2018年立法會就九西及新東舉行補選，而民主派為此舉行初選，民主動力於2017年底緊密召開十多次會議；其中民協前主席馮檢基曾參與該次初選，因此他與施在工作上有緊密接觸。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙同意自己非常熟悉施德來的性格，並補充「雖然我同佢唔係私交上好特別老友，但係喺工作上面，我哋係經常交流意見、商討，所以對佢嘅性格認知都充分嘅」。趙形容，施德來「係一個好懂得尊重人嘅性格」，而就他在表達意見的所有態度及用詞，「我唔會用圓滑啦」，但會形容他「好識得尊重人」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/QRem87B.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
▲ 施德來&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，縱使施在各方面討論有不同意見，「佢都會係一步步、有理有節代表民協去表達佢嘅立場」；又指即使民協作為傳統民主派「畀人好針對」，「佢都係會好有禮貌地作回應，我未見過佢會同其他人有嗰種黃毓民式嘅對鬧指罵。」法官陳仲衡指，但都要有黃毓民的快速應對（quick respond）？趙思考後笑言：「唔好意思，唔識答。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到施的政治立場，趙形容是「溫和理性」，亦同意是配合民協溫和務實的取態。趙亦同意，曾與施德來一同出席2018年東京的亞洲議員論壇。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱九東自發交共同綱領-曾告知同事要收取惟強調非大會要求&quot;&gt;趙稱九東自發交共同綱領 曾告知同事要收取惟強調非大會要求&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃續就初選提名表格發問，其中九東參選人在提交提名表格時均附上共同綱領，提及「會積極運用」否決權，趙同意共同綱領由該選區的素人發起，參選人自發呈交；而他作為民主動力代表，戴曾告知「要收埋佢哋提交嘅呢啲附件」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉問趙有否將之告訴民主動力職員，趙表示有與同事講明除參與初選所需的官方表格外，其他文件「並唔係大會要求嘅」，「不過我哋照收起嚟存檔」，但沒有將共同綱領張貼在票站。趙亦沒有特別叫職員留意收集到的共同綱領。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙同意九東共同綱領據戴耀廷協議擬訂-但不知誰準備和從何獲得&quot;&gt;趙同意九東共同綱領據戴耀廷協議擬訂 但不知誰準備和從何獲得&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙同意，民主動力只曾將提名表格、而非共同綱領張貼在 Facebook 讓參選人下載。黃問九東參選人如何可以取得該份共同綱領？趙指以其認知他們是根據戴耀廷撰寫的協議內容，應用在共同綱領上。李運騰指是問參選人可從哪裏獲得共同綱領，趙指「呢個我真係唔清楚」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續問，戴耀廷是否曾發出九東協調文件，參選人並將其加加減減、修訂成共同綱領並作為附件提交？趙同意戴曾告訴他共同綱領內容是基於戴草擬的文件，但同意事實上不知道參選人在哪裏取得共同綱領。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，九東的6名參選人包括譚文豪、譚得志、施德來、胡志偉、李嘉達及黃之鋒，是否都有夾附內容相同的共同綱領，趙同意。李指那必定有人為他們準備共同綱領，趙表示「就咁睇嘅情況係」，但重申不知道由誰準備，亦不知參選人從哪裏獲得。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指施德來交表後被民動職員要求夾附共同綱領-趙稱不知道亦無要求&quot;&gt;辯方指施德來交表後被民動職員要求夾附共同綱領 趙稱不知道亦無要求&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問是否有九東參選人沒有附交共同綱領，趙稱職員匯報時沒有特別提及。黃續問施德來首次交表時是否沒有夾附共同綱領？惟陳慶偉指趙已稱不知道，並改為問施是否不只提交表格一次。趙回應指很多人報名，而職員稱部分人有文件要後補，但無特別提及施，同意他不清楚施是在交表時一併附上共同綱領，還是後來補交。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃廷光續展示譚得志提名表格，當中共同綱領顯示於於6月22日簽署。黃問表面看來，譚最初是否沒有將共同綱領與提名表格一同呈交？趙指表格顯示職員於6月20日收取，可見譚是交了提名表格後才補交。辯方續展示施德來表格，顯示於6月20日下午收取，並指出施最初交表時沒有夾附共同綱領，是在交表後一兩日，收到民主動力職員的來電，告知他沒有在表格夾附共同綱領，要求他呈交已簽署的共同綱領，趙指他不知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，趙曾否指示職員，九東參選人提交提名表格時須夾附共同綱領？黃廷光亦問有否指示職員要求九東參選人附交共同綱領？趙指「我並無作出呢個指示」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃續指，施德來當時在民動職員要求下，在一個螢幕截圖上簽署，並透過 WhatsApp 呈交，趙指「抱歉黃大狀，我唔知」。黃續展示施德來和譚得志簽署的共同綱領，問施的簽名是否較大？惟法官陳慶偉不批准發問，李運騰並指重點是施德來簽署前對共同綱領的文件是否認知。黃廷光終表示完成盤問，續由代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 發問，法官押至明日進行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙原定明就民事案件應訊-官通知已押後&quot;&gt;趙原定明就民事案件應訊 官通知已押後&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，法官陳慶偉指留意到趙家賢明日有一宗民事案件，趙表示曾透過律師回覆需延期，但不清楚明日是否要上庭，陳表示會替他檢查。陳在臨散庭前，通知趙他明天在區域法院的聆訊會押後，並指刑事案件比民事案件優先，着趙明天就本案應訊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙指「法官閣下唔好意思，多謝你幫手跟進了解多啲聽日個情況」，並指了解懲教署如收到提犯令（body order）或會將他先帶去區域法院，指「當然我知道喺高院呢度係 very first priority，要喺依度協助法庭處理案件」，故麻煩法官處理。陳指趙的律師已為趙申請撤銷提犯令，並下令懲教明日將趙帶到庭。案件明早續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;翻查資料，趙家賢早前被太古城一名業主入稟，質疑屋苑管理公司多年來以管理基金辦康樂活動，要求高院頒令禁制及要求管理公司索償。&lt;/p&gt;

The Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) began increasing its activities as Tsai was in the United States and particularly after her meeting with McCarthy.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;On April 8, the day after Tsai arrived back in Taiwan, the PLA announced and launched large-scale military exercises around Taiwan. These exercises are more significant than China’s responses to past Taiwan presidential transits, and they are reminiscent of the unprecedented PLA response to then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan in August 2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to China’s major show of military force, Beijing has taken relatively less direct diplomatic and economic measures to punish Taiwan and the United States since April 2. China issued four strong statements denouncing the transit and meeting with McCarthy on April 6 and sanctioned a handful of U.S. and Taiwan entities afterwards. On April 10, China signaled desire to deepen economic and other exchanges with Taiwan. What remains to be seen is how former Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou’s trip to China will impact domestic politics in Taiwan — a trip that was likely encouraged and at least partially orchestrated by Beijing. For example, Beijing likely welcomed Ma’s remarks to the press on April 7 after he returned to Taiwan – Ma characterized Taipei’s current leadership and policy as one leading Taiwan towards danger and war and warned that Taiwan has a choice between peace and war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meeting between President Tsai and Speaker McCarthy was framed as an alternative to an immediate visit by Speaker McCarthy to Taiwan — at least postponing his intended travel to the island. By having Tsai and McCarthy meet during an unofficial transit of the United States, there were hopes that Beijing would not escalate as much as it did when Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan in August 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China used the visit by Speaker Pelosi to provoke the Fourth Taiwan Strait Crisis, which included unprecedented military exercises around the island. Compared to the previous Taiwan Strait Crisis of 1995–1996, the August 2022 exercises were closer to the main island of Taiwan — with some of the exercise zones extending into Taiwan’s territorial waters. The PLA Rocket Force also fired multiple ballistic missiles over the main island of Taiwan, with some of them landing into the exclusive economic zones of Japan and the Philippines. Beijing also embraced limited economic punishments against Taiwan and canceled and postponed select areas of U.S.-China engagement and cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PLA Eastern Theater Command reported that it sent the Type 054A frigate Xiangtan, Type 052D guided-missile destroyer Taiyuan, and Type 956EM destroyer Taizhou to conduct live-fire combat exercises in the East China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was reported that a combined arms brigade of the PLA Ground Force based in Guangdong received a large delivery of Type 08 wheeled armored vehicles, which are necessary for “rapid-reaction combat including rapid deployment and mobilized assault missions.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to an announcement by the Liaoning Maritime Safety Administration (MSA), military exercises in the Yellow Sea and Bohai region began on April 2 and continued through April 9.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was reported that the Hainan, a Type 075 amphibious assault ship, carried out a joint sea-air exercise in waters to the west of China’s Guangdong Province. Official Chinese media directly linked this and other exercises to Tsai’s planned meeting with McCarthy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Hainan MSA announced live-fire exercises would be held in an area off of the island’s northeastern coast from April 4–6.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;14 PLA aircraft and 3 naval vessels were detected around Taiwan by Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense (MND). Two of the detected aircraft entered Taiwan’s southwest ADIZ.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was reported that a combined arms brigade under the PLA 72nd Group Army held a combat-oriented beach assault exercise. The 72nd Group Army is an amphibious force that is responsible for cross-sea landing missions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Japan’s Maritime Self-Defense Force observed the Type 052C destroyer Changchun sailing northwest through the waters between Yonaguni Island and Taiwan on April 4. It then sailed northward through waters approximately 70 km west of the disputed Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands on April 5. The vessel had previously sailed south through the waters between the main island of Okinawa and Miyako Island on April 3.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China announced a three-day “special joint patrol and inspection operation” in the central and northern areas of the Taiwan Strait. As part of this operation, Chinese maritime law enforcement officials were tasked with conducting on-site inspections (现场检查) aboard vessels in the Taiwan Strait, but there were no reports of such on-site inspections taking place. The operation was led by China’s first large-scale patrol vessel in the Taiwan Strait, the Haixun 06. Vessels from the Fujian Maritime Safety Administration, East China Sea Rescue Bureau and the East China Sea Maritime Security Center joined. Notably, the first law enforcement patrol the Haixun 06 embarked on occurred during then-Speaker of the House Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan in August 2022. In response to Haixun 06’s April 2023 operations, Taiwan’s Maritime and Port Bureau issued a statement that relevant shipping companies have been told to refuse these inspections.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PLA Navy’s Shandong aircraft carrier passed through the Bashi Channel and into waters off of Taiwan’s southeastern coast for long-range training in the West Pacific. Japan’s Ministry of Defense (MoD) reported that the Shandong was accompanied by the Type 054A frigate Liuzhou and the Chaganhu, a Type 901 fast combat support ship. The ships traveled eastward in an area 186 miles south of Hateruma Island. Japanese guided-missile destroyer Sawagiri shadowed the carrier group. Notably, the USS Nimitz aircraft carrier was sailing about 400 nautical miles east of Taiwan that day.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A PLA news site reported that a vessel-borne helicopter regiment affiliated with the PLA Eastern Theater Command Navy carried out landing exercises during both day and night on the Type 075 amphibious assault ship Guangxi over several days.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Japan’s Maritime Self-Defense Force observed the Type 054A frigate Anyang sailing northwest in the waters between Yonaguni Island and Taiwan on April 5. It then sailed northward through the waters between Yonaguni Island and Taiwan, and then sailed northward through the waters approximately 80 km west of the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands on April 6. The vessel had previously sailed south through the waters between the main island of Okinawa and Miyako on April 3.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Fujian MSA announced that live-fire drills would be held off the northern coast of Pingtan Island on April 10 for 13 hours. The exercise zone covers an area of approximately 39 square kilometers (15 square miles). At its closest point, the exercise zone is approximately 30 kilometers (19 miles) from Dongju Island, the southernmost island of Taiwan’s Matsu Islands. However, the announcement was later removed from the MSA website, raising questions about whether the exercises took place.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Fujian MSA also announced live-fire drills would be held in Luoyuan Bay, northwest of Taiwan’s Matsu Islands. The drills were scheduled from 8 am – 12 pm on April 8, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 20. However, the announcement was later removed from the MSA website, raising questions about whether the exercises took place or will later in April.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Japan’s MoD reported that China’s Shandong aircraft carrier and its escort ships were approximately 242 miles (390 km) south of the Japanese island of Miyako.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Liaoning MSA announced three military exercises that would occur in the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea. Exercises were scheduled for 8 hours on April 8 and 10 hours on April 9. Immediately following the April 9 exercise, another exercise would begin that same day, from April 9 to April 16.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Previously Announced PLA Live-fire Exercises Near Taiwan’s Matsu Islands.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;saturday-april-8&quot;&gt;Saturday, April 8&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At 8:16 am Beijing time, the PLA Eastern Theater Command (ETC) announced that from April 8–10, it would “organize combat readiness patrols around Taiwan Island and conduct “Joint Sword” exercises in the Taiwan Strait, around the northern and southern parts of Taiwan Island, and in the sea and airspace to the east of Taiwan Island.” At 10:01 am, the ETC repeated the announcement, adding that the exercises are “a serious warning against ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist forces’ collusion and provocation with external forces, and a necessary action to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity.” The exercises involved joint operations across the PLA Army, Navy, Air Force, and Rocket Forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the first day, the exercises focused on testing the PLA’s capability to seize control of sea, air, and information domains under the support of the joint combat system. PLA Navy frigates and destroyers practiced short-range assaults, long-range deterrence, and air defense and anti-missile drills. There were also joint anti-submarine drills with cooperation from police patrol boats. Dozens of J-16 and J-10C fighters carried out live ammunition and medium and long range air combat drills with the support of early warning aircraft, jammers, and refueling aircraft. PLA Rocket Force conventional missile brigades were also dispatched.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As part of the exercises, the Type 052D destroyer Taiyuan reportedly came within 24 nautical miles of Taiwan Island — the point where Taiwan’s contiguous zone starts. This suggests Chinese vessels are operating increasingly close to the island; however, there are no reports of vessels entering Taiwan’s territorial waters (which extend 12 nautical miles from Taiwan’s territorial baseline).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s MND reported that by 11 am, 42 PLA aircraft and 8 vessels were detected in areas around Taiwan. Later, Taiwan’s MND reported a total of 71 aircraft and 9 vessels around Taiwan. Up to this point, this was by far the highest figure reported in 2023, and tied for the highest ever recorded.2 Of these, 45 aircraft crossed the southern, central, and northern areas of the Taiwan Strait median line and entered into the southwest ADIZ.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Japan’s MoD reported that the Shandong was over 267 miles (430 km) south of Miyako Island.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reportedly, a PLA amphibious landing ship carried out live-fire exercises just 30 miles (50 km) northwest of the Matsu Islands in the Luoyuan Bay. The vessel “fired shells at targets on land and at sea.” This aligned with an April 7 announcement by the Fujian MSA of a series of exercises over several days in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;sunday-april-9&quot;&gt;Sunday, April 9&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China continued with large-scale exercises around the island. According to a CCTV report, “Under the unified command of the theater’s Joint Operations Command Center, multiple types of units carried out simulated joint precision strikes against key targets on Taiwan Island and the surrounding waters, and continued to maintain the momentum of encircling the island.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As part of the exercise, several PLA aircraft and vessels worked jointly to create a “shore-sea-air joint strike system.” The PLA also released an animation that depicts several land-based assets, aircraft, and vessels launching joint precision strikes at key targets on Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to reports, about 20 vessels — half from China and half from Taiwan — were engaged in a stand-off near the median line that divides the Taiwan Strait. However, details about the situation remain scant.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taiwan MND reported that a total of 70 PLA aircraft and 11 vessels had been detected around Taiwan that day. Of these aircraft, 35 crossed the southern, central, and northern areas of the Taiwan Strait median line and entered the southwest and southeast ADIZ. Notably, four J-15 fighters took off from the Shandong aircraft carrier and entered Taiwan’s southeastern ADIZ, marking the first time J-15s have entered the ADIZ.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Japanese MoD reported that the Shandong had moved north, coming within 142 miles (230 km) of Miyako Island.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;h4 id=&quot;monday-april-10&quot;&gt;Monday, April 10&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the final day of the “Joint Sword” exercises, CCTV reporting noted that drills focused on “joint shock and deterrence and island closure and control” (联合震慑，孤岛封控). This emphasized maneuvers to cut of access to the island from seas east of Taiwan. Several destroyers and frigates carried out suppressive combat patrol missions and joint blockade simulations, and the Shandong aircraft carrier group participated in the final day of drills from the waters east of Taiwan. The carrier group consisted of one Type 055 destroyer, one Type 052D destroyer, two Type 054A frigates, one Type 901 replenishment ship, and there was likely a nuclear-powered attack submarine as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s MND reported a record-high number of PLA aircraft around Taiwan. A total of 91 aircraft and 12 vessels had been detected. Of those aircraft, 54 crossed the Taiwan Strait median line or entered Taiwan’s southwest and southeast ADIZ. For the second day in a row, J-15 fighters entered the southeast ADIZ after presumably launching from the Shandong carrier.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Japan’s MoD announced that between April 7-9, the Shandong carrier launched a total of roughly 120 sorties, including about 80 aircraft and 40 helicopter sorties. Japan’s MoD also announced that since March 28, the PLA Type 815A electronic reconnaissance vessel Kaiyangxing had been circling Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shortly after 6 pm, the ETC announced the successful conclusion of the “joint cruise and patrol special operation” in the Taiwan Strait.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;tuesday-april-11&quot;&gt;Tuesday, April 11&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The day after the conclusion of the “Joint Sword” exercises, Taiwan’s MND reported it had detected 26 aircraft and nine vessels carrying out combat readiness patrols. In total, 35 aircraft and 8 vessels detected in the region, and 15 of these aircraft entered Taiwan’s ADIZ or crossed the Taiwan Strait median line.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reuters stated that there were small-scale military exercises occurring off the coast of Fuzhou, which were likely part of the previously announced exercises by Fujian MSA.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Japan’s MoD reported that the Shandong aircraft carrier was about 180 miles (290 km) from Japan’s Miyako Island.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;wednesday-april-12&quot;&gt;Wednesday, April 12&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s Ministry of Transportation and Communication reported that on April 11, China had issued a no-fly zone due to “aerospace activities” that China would be conducting in a busy region of airspace north of Taiwan from April 16 to 18, from 9 am to 2 pm each day. China then reduced the timeframe to just 27 minutes, from 9:30 am to 9:57 am on April 16. This zone overlaps within Taiwan’s ADIZ and is just 85 nautical miles from Taiwan’s northern coast. Taiwan’s Central News Agency reported that China’s modified “no fly zone” will impact 33 flights in total.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s MND reported 26 PLA aircraft and 7 PLAN vessels around Taiwan. A total of 14 aircraft crossed the Taiwan Strait median line.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s Shandong carrier group was still operating in the West Pacific, 137 miles (220 km) south of Japan’s Miyako Island.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;thursday-april-13&quot;&gt;Thursday, April 13&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China announced a new warning related to a zone north of Taiwan. The Fujian MSA announced that vessels should not enter the zone due to the possibility of falling rocket debris from 9:00 am to 3:00 pm on Sunday, April 16.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Hainan MSA announced four-day military exercises from April 16–19 in the South China Sea northeast of Hainan Island.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s MND reported that it detected 4 PLA aircraft and 8 naval vessels around Taiwan. One aircraft entered Taiwan’s southwest ADIZ.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Shandong carrier group moved southeast, further into the West Pacific. Japan’s MoD tracked the group almost 286 miles (460 km) south-southeast of Miyako Island.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;friday-april-14&quot;&gt;Friday, April 14&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s MND reported 6 PLA aircraft and 4 navy vessels around the island. Two PLA aircraft crossed the median line or entered Taiwan’s SW ADIZ.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regarding the airspace and maritime closure zone announced for April 16, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin stated that reports describing it as a “no-fly zone” was “not accurate.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s Shandong carrier continued moving east away from Taiwan and reportedly was 323 miles (520 km) south-west of the Japanese-administers Okinotorishima reef.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s MND reported 8 PLA aircraft and 5 PLAN vessels around the island. 3 aircraft crossed the Taiwan Strait median line or entered Taiwan’s ADIZ.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;saturday-april-15&quot;&gt;Saturday, April 15&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Japan’s MoD reported that the Shandong carrier group was 230 miles (370 km) Southeast of Okinotorishima reef in the West Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s Ministry of Defense observed 15 PLA aircraft and 4 PLAN vessels around Taiwan. Four of the PLA aircraft entered the southeast and southwest portions of Taiwan’s ADIZ.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;sunday-april-16&quot;&gt;Sunday, April 16&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chinese authorities announced the successful launch of a Long March-4B rocket that was carrying a meteorological satellite (Fengyun-3 07, also referred to as Fengyun-3G) from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in Gansu Province. Debris from the launch was later detected in the previously announced maritime and airspace closure zone. The zone was reportedly free of aircraft between 9:30–10:20 am.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Shandong carrier was tracked by the Japanese MoD 441 miles (710 km) south-southeast of Okinotorishima reef. Additionally, Japan’s MoD reported that aircraft based on the Shandong conducted 210 sorties from April 10-16, and from April 7–16, there was a total of 330 sorties. Japan scrambled fighter jets in response to this activity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The USS Milius Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer sailed through the Taiwan Strait, just a week after it sailed past Chinese man-made islands in the South China Sea. China’s Ministry of Foreign affairs accused the United States of disrupting peace in the Strait. The PLA Eastern Theater Command also issued a statement and ensured that they will “resolutely defend national sovereignty and regional peace.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s MND reported 18 PLA aircraft and 4 PLAN vessels around Taiwan Island. Four PLA aircraft entered Taiwan’s southwest and southeast ADIZ.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;monday-april-17&quot;&gt;Monday, April 17&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Qingdao Maritime Safety Administration announced 3 hours of “major” military activities on April 18 in an area of the Yellow Sea. The coordinates for the exercise indicate an area along the coast of the port city of Qingdao, but further details of the exercises were not released.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s MND reported 12 PLA aircraft and 4 PLAN vessels around Taiwan Island. Four of the aircraft entered Taiwan’s southwest ADIZ.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;tuesday-april-18&quot;&gt;Tuesday, April 18&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;New reports indicated that Taiwan plans to purchase up to 400 U.S.-made land-launched Harpoon missiles as part of deal approved in 2020 by the United States Congress. The U.S. Defense Department announced the $1.7 billion contract with Boeing on April 7 but did not indicate then that Taiwan is the purchaser.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reportedly, China conducted a military drill in the Yellow Sea that started April 18 at 9:00 am local time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;timeline-of-key-chinese-diplomatic-and-non-military-activities&quot;&gt;Timeline of Key Chinese Diplomatic and Non-Military Activities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to its military activities, China’s direct diplomatic and non-military responses escalated after the Tsai-McCarthy meeting. From April 6 onwards, China embraced sanctions on select U.S. and Taiwan entities. Beijing, however, appears to be balancing its desire to punish Tsai and the current government in Taipei with a broader imperative to increase various forms of economic and political exchanges between China and Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;tuesday-april-4-1&quot;&gt;Tuesday, April 4&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One day prior to the Tsai-McCarthy meeting, the congressional liaison at the Chinese embassy in Washington Li Xiang sent an email to members of Congress who would be in attendance at the meeting, urging them to not meet with Tsai. Li warned that China opposes “any form of official interaction between the US and Taiwan” and that China “will most likely take necessary and resolute actions in response.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;thursday-april-6&quot;&gt;Thursday, April 6&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a highly orchestrated public move, four major Chinese government actors and departments each issued public statements denouncing Tsai’s transit and meeting with Speaker McCarthy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s top legislative body, the National People’s Congress, asserted, “The action of McCarthy, the third highest-ranking official of the U.S. government, has seriously broken the commitment made by the United States to China on the Taiwan question” and it reiterated that “the Taiwan issue” is “the first red line that must not be crossed in China-U.S. relations.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) issued a statement that warned that “‘Taiwan independence’ and cross-Strait peace and stability are as irreconcilable as fire and water,” promising that “the pursuit of ‘Taiwan independence’ will lead nowhere.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The State Council’s Taiwan Affairs Office condemned the “DPP authorities” who “promote Taiwan-US collusion.” It noted that Tsai and the DPP are pushing Taiwan toward a dangerous brink of potential conflict. The office warned that it “will take firm measures to punish the ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist forces and their actions” and “any act of seeking ‘independence’ will be smashed to pieces under the powerful force of the Chinese sons and daughters to oppose ‘independence’ and promote reunification.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s MND issued a statement saying that the PLA “sticks to its duties and missions” and “resolutely defends national sovereignty and territorial integrity.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;friday-april-7-1&quot;&gt;Friday, April 7&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Taiwan Work Office issued sanctions on certain institutions and individuals in both Taiwan and the United States. Hsiao Bi-khim, Taiwan’s representative to the United States, was sanctioned for a second time. The sanctions bar her from entering mainland China, Hong Kong, or Macao due to her “diehard” support for “Taiwan independence.” China also sanctioned the leaders of Taiwan’s Prospect Foundation (a think tank focusing on cross-Strait relations) and the Council of Asian Liberals and Democrats (a regional organization of liberal democratic political parties in Asia). In the United States, China sanctioned the Hudson Institute and the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, and specific administrators at each organization, freezing any assets they had in China and barring them from entering the country.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a MFA press conference, spokesperson Mao Ning emphasized that “the Taiwan question is not about democracy, but about China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,” claiming “the sovereignty and territory of China have never been divided and shall never be divided.” She asserted that “the future of Taiwan lies in China’s reunification, and the wellbeing of the people in Taiwan hinges on the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;monday-april-10-1&quot;&gt;Monday, April 10&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said “the combat readiness security patrol encircling the Taiwan Island and the ‘Joint Sword’ exercises is a stern warning to the provocative activities of ‘Taiwan independence’”secessionist forces and their collusion with external forces,” highlighting the exercises as “a necessary move to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wang Huning, a Politburo Standing Committee member and chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, met with a delegation of Taiwan business executives led by Liu Chao-shiuan, co-president of the Cross-Strait CEO Summit in Beijing. Wang messaged the desire for improved economic and trade exchanges and that peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait “cannot be realized with the existence of ‘Taiwan independence.’”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;wednesday-april-12-1&quot;&gt;Wednesday, April 12&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;China’s Ministry of Commerce announced it was launching an investigation into Taiwan’s trade restrictions on over 2,400 mainland goods at the request of several trade groups. Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council warned that the investigation will not improve cross-strait trade but make future cooperation more difficult.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（17日）踏入審訊第44天。趙家賢繼續接受盤問，確認各區各有共識，惟就如何達成並無任何規則。法官關注如何處理分歧，趙指戴耀廷會邀請各方講解想法，會後亦會私下游說，「佢揸住架 MINI Cooper 可以周圍走」；又指若仍未能達共識，投票可算是「解決死局」的做法，惟承認從沒規定採納「少數服從多數」原則。趙又供稱第二次新東會議民主黨代表是李永成，惟辯方指李於2018年底、2019年初已退黨，趙指「完全冇印象」，向法官和辯方表示「唔好意思」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，趙今同意提名表格稱要認同的「協調會議共識」不包括當選後行為，與上周稱包括否決預算案不同；又強調如何得出共識與民主動力無關，惟再被法官引帖文質疑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢確認各區各有共識無跨區會議或溝通-惟戴耀廷望達至統一&quot;&gt;趙家賢確認各區各有共識、無跨區會議或溝通 惟戴耀廷望達至統一&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢繼續接受代表林卓廷和黃碧雲的大律師沈士文盤問。辯方今就提名表格發問，趙確認表格由民主動力設計，他批准後再交戴耀廷審閱，最後才交所有參選人使用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後展示九龍西黃碧雲的提名表格，趙同意初選未曾開過任何跨區會議，或有所有參選人一同溝通的群組，故就表格上「我確認支持和認同由戴耀廷及區諾軒主導之協調會議共識，包括『民主派35+公民投票計劃』及其目標」的條款，「協調會議共識」僅指參選人所屬選區的共識，在黃碧雲而言即九龍西。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙確認，每區均有各自的共識和條款，如新界西望投票人數達致某一數目才生效，故提名表格是較「綜合性」的寫法。法官李運騰問，但組織者也嘗試在各區達致某種一致性？趙同意，指九龍東起初打算用棄選機制，惟在協調會議過程不同選區或有報告，「大家喺傾嘅過程慢慢聚焦咗喺某啲共識之中。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，故即使原本計劃每區有各自的共識，如出選名單數目和目標票數不同，但組織者有意達成某種一致性（uniformity）？趙答：「我留意到戴耀廷召開協調會議嘅一啲講法，係有呢個意圖喺當中」，並同意因此最終各區都同意進行初選，和統一為投一票，亦因當時政局情況而設有替補機制等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢稱非中委成員-以其權限得知民主黨內同意參與初選&quot;&gt;趙家賢稱非中委成員 以其權限得知民主黨內同意參與初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問同為民主黨黨員的趙家賢，民主黨曾否討論在「35+計劃」要同意或不同意什麼事項？趙指，他當時任民主黨東區黨團召集人、並非中央委員，而在民主黨用作工作交流的 WhatsApp 群組，他留意到「大家知道個情況係需要有個初選」，以減少正式選舉時民主陣營「互相鬥爭、chur票」；大家亦「同意民主黨係會參與初選」，及若初選未能出線，有關人士就不會參與正式選舉。趙並指：「而我當時嘅權限或我嘅角色，只可以知道呢啲訊息去提供協助處理今次嘅案件。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱就如何達共識無書面或口頭規則-曾信戴用調解員方式促進溝通惟發現無應用&quot;&gt;趙稱就如何達共識無書面或口頭規則 曾信戴用調解員方式促進溝通惟發現無應用&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後就會上如何達成共識發問。趙確認，從2020年3月至他於7月退出「35+」，與戴耀廷、區諾軒、黎敬輝、鍾錦麟均有恆常溝通，並補充鍾在6月中因孩子出生，「我就叫佢作為一家之主，呢啲時候你照顧屋企多啲啦」，故鍾「冇乜參與」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文續問在整個計劃中，就如何達成共識，有否任何書面的規則？趙確認以其認知和就民主動力而言，「係完全冇呢種文件出現過」；而在他與組織者或任何人的溝通中，亦「從來沒有聽過」有人談及相關規則，亦無以書面或口頭稱會以投票達成共識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡問，那趙有提議任何規則嗎？趙指「我冇特別去建議」，因為他得知戴耀廷曾去過美國哈佛大學「就讀過我哋調解界最希望讀到嘅殿堂級課程，就係 Programme of Negotitaion」，並曾分享一些調解界認知的客觀準則和操守。趙續指，因認知戴有修讀有關調解專業的知識和技巧，「所以我當時真誠地確信，佢係應該會用調解員嗰種嘅方式，一個促進嘅形式去處理呢個35+整個嘅協調工作」，如訂立一些會議規則和有共同基礎，不過他開會時留意到「唔係好覺得佢有應用到我哋調解嘅呢啲技巧同做法」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官關注如何處理分歧-趙指戴曾會後找與會者傾佢揸住架mini-cooper可周圍走&quot;&gt;官關注如何處理分歧 趙指戴曾會後找與會者傾：佢揸住架MINI Cooper可周圍走&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續確認，在計劃中從沒有聽過以「少數服從多數」原則達成共識，並同意「廣義」而言，表格條款中「共識」一字只是指「共同理解（common understanding）」。法官李運騰指「共同理解」不一定代表有同一意見，續問那當會上有分歧會如何處理？是由得分歧存在？游說或強迫其他人？抑或其他？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙回應，當時觀察到不同光譜表達意見時，「係會有少少南轅北轍」，而戴耀廷主持會議時也有邀請各方詳細講解他們要求背後的思維想法或原則，以調解角度而言「即係佢嘗試透過呢啲提問去達致相互理解」。李運騰指，理解不代表同意，再問即如何處理分歧？趙指留意到戴曾向某些與會者稱「我會後再特別走過嚟你個區、你個議員辦事處同你傾啦」。李問，即有一些私下的游說？趙指「冇錯，一嚟佢揸住架 MINI Cooper 可以周圍走啦」，林卓廷笑說「嘩」，趙續指戴經常與該些與會者傾談和吃飯，了解更多當時政治狀況。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指若仍未達共識-投票可解決死局-惟戴規則好臨時性事前不知會投票&quot;&gt;趙指若仍未達共識 投票可「解決死局」 惟戴規則「好臨時性」、事前不知會投票&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉問，若戴耀廷已窮盡所有方法，仍未能達成共識，舉例他不認為戴能說服司馬文或岑子杰同意運用否決權，那這個時候就會用「意向性投票」解決？趙同意曾試過很多營造共識的溝通方式，並重申據他向助手了解，新東和新西曾進行意向性投票。趙指以他「調解員」的認知而言，「做咗咁多嘢，如果件事情想繼續推進、有個方案做到嘅話」，在參與持分者很多下，正式投票或意向性投票「係一個叫做去解決嗰個死局嘅做法」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟趙強調，以他調解員的認知，若要用投票形式，事前一定要談好規則，「因為一般人 expect 係覺得應該大家得到共識，就唔係多數壓住咗少數去做」；惟他認為據戴耀廷所述，似乎就如何投票的規則是「好臨時性，冇話之前點樣傾得好仔細」。法官陳慶偉指，雖投票規則是臨時，但區議會主席也可做見證。趙同意，並指區議會主席絕不會參與立法會選舉、無利益衝突，有高度公信力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指新東第二次會議民主黨代表為李永成-辯方指李當時已離黨&quot;&gt;趙指新東第二次會議民主黨代表為李永成 辯方指李當時已離黨&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙上周供稱，5月5日新東第二次會議曾進行意向性投票，通過使用「會運用」。他確認在該次會議前「我冇見過、冇認知會有投票呢樣嘢」，並同意會上就否決預算案有「拉扯」，林卓廷亦不在場。區諾軒早前稱林卓廷該次會議的代表是莊榮輝，惟趙則稱是李永成。沈士文向趙指出，林卓廷在該次會議的代表是莊榮輝。趙顯得疑惑，並指據助手的會議筆記，民主黨代表是李永成，但其後確認他不知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;庭上其後展示黎敬輝的筆記，提及李永成有發言，趙指李2020年5月時是民主黨沙田區議員，但不能確定他是否仍任民主黨中央委員。惟沈士文指，李其實於2018年底、2019年初已離開民主黨，趙指「我完全冇印象呢件事情，唔好意思法官閣下同沈大狀」，有被告大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/lZhWFrZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 李永成（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指，黎敬輝筆記提及有民主黨代表在場，故趙不能排除林卓廷當時是由其他人代表？趙指若當時他「搞錯咗」李永成代表民主黨，「咁即係嗰個會議一定有民主黨代表，但我唔知邊個係」，並指與助手溝通時，亦沒有特別提到莊榮輝在場。但趙確認，首次新東會議莊榮輝代表林卓廷，莊曾稱不獲授權投票，而黎敬輝曾提及第二次會議與會者「同上次大部分差唔多」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙錄影會面曾稱協調會議共識僅指初選-不包括當選後行為&quot;&gt;趙錄影會面曾稱協調會議共識僅指初選 不包括當選後行為&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續引趙家賢於2021年6月29日首次錄影會面，被問表格上「協調會議共識」指什麼，趙指各區就出選名單數目等有不同，而表格要「一致性」，故寫法「籠統」。他又指當時會議共識就是「大家係願意參與初選」，而條款「唔係講緊要入到立法會、要點做呀嗰啲嘅共識，係講緊其實只係希望為民主陣營爭取集中票源，減少出選隊伍，增加多啲議席咁樣」，「當然之後佢哋有額外再簽其他嗰啲就係另外一回事」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙確認上述是民主動力的看法，重申民動理解「共識」範圍只限於參與初選、集中票源。他並確認，提名表格是於戴耀廷在6月9日記者會稱不用簽聲明，翌日「墨落無悔」發布後才正式落實，強調「墨落無悔」與組織者無關，並同意他「絕對反對」綑綁參選人入立會後的行為。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙強調共識如何得出與民動無關-官引fb帖文質疑-趙稱職員有fb權限逾月後始察出事&quot;&gt;趙強調共識如何得出與民動無關 官引FB帖文質疑 趙稱職員有FB權限、逾月後始察「出事」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文問，因此趙家賢作為表格的設計者，使用「協調會議共識」字眼只是指他對計劃的初心，而非關乎當選後的行為？趙重申「其實我寫落去係用緊『九二共識，一中各表（一個中國，各自表述）』呢種籠統嘅寫法去寫」，而字眼上提及「戴耀廷及區諾軒主導之協調會議共識」，而非「民主動力」支持的共識，是因就該共識的解讀，他和民主動力有上述看法。陳慶偉問，即趙認為戴和區有共同共識？趙指不會這樣說，因程序上他們是會議協調人，「其實呢個寫法有個隱含意思，就係佢哋嗰時共識點傾，總之同民主動力無關嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟法官陳仲衡主動引趙家賢6月9日的Facebook帖文截圖，提及「民主派35+公民投票」目標就是為了奪取過半議席，「光復立法會，奪回控制權，壓制港共政權」。趙重申，上述眾籌頁面內容由兼職同事撰寫，他認為「出咗事」，又指「無論點樣都好，我作為組織嘅召集人負責人，都有責任去承擔嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟陳質疑若然如此，趙又將帖文於Facebook發布。趙回應，其職員有民主動力和他個人Facebook的權限，會協助他進行宣傳，兩個專頁「一雞兩味」。趙續指，「法官閣下我想提一提，民主動力係蚊型組織，當日記者會後除咗訪問都有好多工作要做，咁而嗰陣時網上啲嘢我就交咗畀同事去負責…整個過程當中啲時間係好緊密嘅，坦白講唔可能所有嘢都係我親手做、所有嘢都係我親自處理同安排晒。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳問當時他有否閱讀該帖文，趙指「睇咗開頭」，將眾籌金額由400萬改為350萬；至於全篇文章，他是直至7月14日得知戴耀廷〈真攬炒十步〉一文後，開始檢視民主動力各方面的資料，才看到眾籌版面「出咗事」。陳問，即趙家賢在帖文發布一個月後才首次閱畢？趙同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（17日）踏入審訊第44天。趙家賢繼續接受盤問，他曾於警方錄影會面表示，鄒家成等發布「墨落無悔」，令部分溫和民主派被逼「跟住個政治大勢」簽署，而戴耀廷曾指九龍東黃之鋒及新界西朱凱廸均叫同區其他候選人簽協議，最終兩區以戴草擬、無公開的共同綱領為藍本修訂，並在報名時夾附已簽署的共同綱領。趙亦曾於錄影會面稱因林卓廷代表在新東會議「反對攬炒」，故深信新東「肯定唔會」簽署相關文件，惟他今改稱民主黨代表當時僅提出「關注和顧慮」，林卓廷驚訝說「吓」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，趙透露承辦初選時無就「35+計劃」與民主黨黨友黃碧雲及林卓廷直接聯繫，指他有「行事嘅道德準則」，雖只是辦民間初選仍「當自己係選管會主席嚟做」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱戴起草共同綱領後很多泛民唔制墨落無悔逼溫和民主派跟大勢簽署&quot;&gt;趙稱戴起草共同綱領後很多泛民「唔制」、「墨落無悔」逼溫和民主派跟大勢簽署&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢繼續接受代表林卓廷和黃碧雲的大律師沈士文盤問。辯方引趙家賢於2021年6月29日首次錄影會面謄本，趙曾提及戴耀廷起草各區「共同綱領」後曾發給許多人，「當然傳統嘅民主派好多都唔制喇」，他和區諾軒遂向戴反映，「好堅持我哋覺得唔應該參與個初選係有呢啲前設嘅嘢要簽」，戴並同意。趙確認上述內容，並指望將「唔制」改為「好多關注、好多顧慮」；並同意有上述看法是因認為初選不應綑綁當選後的行為。法官陳仲衡一度指，趙只是說反對簽署協議，而非反對有前設，趙補充他亦曾表達入議會後議員應自主行事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續在會面稱，在初選記者會後，有三人發起「墨落無悔」並在社交媒體向市民宣傳他們看法和價值觀，「其實就逼到好多一啲溫和民主陣營嘅人士…跟住個政治大勢，你唔簽嘅話，就可能會得失咗一啲支持者嘞，咁所以都有部分係簽咗嘅嗰陣時」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，到了初選提名期，本身毋須簽任何協議，但好明顯九東和新西的本土抗爭派，「會逼番嗰個區裏面嘅其他候選人」，稱「喂，嗱，你橫掂『墨落無悔』嗰度有啲都簽咗喇…大家都應該要支持嗰陣時喺嗰個協調會議，我哋想倡議嘅嘢」，趙盤問下確認倡議是指運用否決權。趙並指，戴之後向他指九龍東黃之鋒，及新界西朱凱廸都有叫其他人簽協議，他最終亦按戴指示照收該兩區的聲明。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡一度問發起「墨落無悔」的三人是誰，趙指包括鄒家成、張可森，其後思考近10秒指另一位是「香港島嘅參選人」，鄒家成發笑，趙在辯方提問下確認是梁晃維。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙引戴耀廷指九東黃之鋒及新西朱凱廸倡簽協議-以戴發出協議為藍本&quot;&gt;趙引戴耀廷指九東黃之鋒及新西朱凱廸倡簽協議 以戴發出協議為藍本&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙同意，當時本土抗爭派嘗試游說較溫和一方同意運用否決權，而戴耀廷曾以電話向他表示，九龍東和新界西大部分候選人都有「好強烈意見」想「實體地白紙黑字簽一份嘢」，並特別提到九東是由黃之鋒、新西是由朱凱廸倡議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jatzdos.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
▲ 前排：朱凱廸（左）、黃之鋒（中）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙在2021年7月21日的第二次錄影會面，曾稱黃之鋒等人「佢哋都會覺得係要有番份嘢簽出嚟嘅」，趙指他們是以戴耀廷6月8日發出的各區協議最後版本作為「藍本」，將該份毋須簽署的不公開文件進行修訂和「加加減減」，寫成該兩區最後額外簽署的聲明。趙並指，他很清楚向戴表明這是戴作為協調人跟與會者的溝通，而本身民主動力接收的官方文件不包括此，「因為你嘅意思而收㗎啫」，戴則稱「收咗你照存放得啦」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢確認謄本出錯-應為新界東肯定唔會簽文件-而非肯定會&quot;&gt;趙家賢確認謄本出錯 應為新界東「肯定唔會」簽文件 而非「肯定會」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據該謄本，被問為何除了九龍東和新界西，其他區又沒有簽額外聲明時，趙指各區做法不同，並指就新界東，「特別直情係林卓廷個代表都話咗反對攬炒、即係諗住係無差別否決財政預算案，因為你冇理由起醫院都反對呀，咁所以我深信所以新界東就『肯定會』有一啲呢類型嘅文件會簽出嚟。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文指翻聽片段後發現謄本有錯，句子中的「會」應為「唔會」，在延伸庭的黃之鋒邊聽邊激動說話，被告席又傳來驚嘆的「吓！」聲音。沈續在庭上播出片段，趙確認應為「肯定唔會」，又一度稱「我發現警方搵嗰間外判間嘢（謄寫公司）係好有問題」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙修改錄影會面說法-指民主黨代表在新東非反對攬炒僅提疑問&quot;&gt;趙修改錄影會面說法 指民主黨代表在新東非「反對攬炒」、僅提疑問&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問趙是否維持說法，趙指望刪去「反對攬炒」，並改為指「林卓廷個代表都就住無差別否決財政預算案表達咗關注同顧慮」。林卓廷大聲說「吓」，「有得咁？」，又與鄒家成相視而笑。趙解釋，當時其實沒有聽到「反對攬炒」的字眼，指民主黨代表是就無差別否決預算案提出「關注和顧慮」，又指民主黨代表僅提出「疑問」，即關注是否連起醫院、學校也反對，林卓廷再面露驚訝稱「吓」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指司馬文比民主黨代表更清楚反對否決財案&quot;&gt;趙指司馬文比民主黨代表更清楚反對否決財案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問到，因此是提出疑問多於反對？趙同意，並主動提出香港島的司馬文作對比，指司馬文便好清楚表明反對「為否決而否決」。趙又指，司馬文當時是公共專業聯盟的主席，「提名曾俊華選特首嗰個」，自己也是該組織的執委會成員，聯盟亦清楚反對否決預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙在法官詢問下確認，司馬文當時計劃參加香港島初選，但最終沒有參與，因為聯盟的商界及中小企對於否決財政預算案「完全覺得係好詫異」。李運騰問，聯盟是否不接受「會運用」或「會積極運用」的字眼？趙表示：「應該話佢哋就財政預算案唔同細節位，係會同政府有個商討。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙終同意，由於林卓廷代表當時清楚表達對否決預算案的關注和顧慮，故肯定新界東不會簽署該類文件；加上他當時是民主黨黨員，以他在黨的身分地位所收到黨政策的訊息，均認為因此新東不會有該協議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙無就協調與黃碧雲林卓廷溝通-稱有道德準則我會當自己係選管會主席嚟做&quot;&gt;趙無就協調與黃碧雲林卓廷溝通 稱有道德準則：我會當自己係選管會主席嚟做&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，趙家賢早前提及，於新東第二次會議後曾向戴耀廷反映民主黨代表不獲授權投票，戴稱會處理民主黨的關注，惟趙在盤問下同意，他並不知道戴有沒有真的這樣做。沈士文指出，事實上林卓廷、黃碧雲和他們的代表，從來沒有與戴耀廷就此有直接或間接接觸，趙指他不知道，但重提區諾軒曾向他指，戴「係充分獲得傳統民主派元老嘅授權」，此時林卓廷「O嘴」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，「元老」包括李永達和李卓人，指他們授權予戴耀廷做協調，「而並不是本身多年嚟協助傳統民主派做協調嘅民主動力去做」，故當時自然認知他們有緊密溝通，亦因此沒追問戴有否處理民主黨問題。法官陳仲衡問，那林卓廷和黃碧雲有否向趙提出跟進？趙指沒有與二人有直接聯繫，即使他同為民主黨黨員，「因為我自己會有一個行事嘅道德準則，咁當時承辦緊個初選，雖然係民間初選，但我會當自己係選管會主席嚟做」，林卓廷和鄒家成發笑。趙續確認，他就「35+計劃」從沒有與林和黃接觸。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指戴耀廷獲李永達李卓人等元老授權辦協調-惟指二人不認同否決財案&quot;&gt;趙指戴耀廷獲李永達李卓人等元老授權辦協調 惟指二人不認同否決財案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙其後確認，區提及戴獲民主派元老授權是在3月26日首次35+記招後，當時趙因被「排除在外」而向區了解情況。沈士文續指，李永達和李卓人就「35+計劃」的參與只是2020年初，與否決預算案無關。惟陳慶偉質疑1月的飯局上，戴耀廷已曾提及「大殺傷力憲制武器」，並改為問李卓人和李永達是否從來不認同（endorse）否決預算案？趙確認，指二人是授權戴耀廷進行立法會選舉嘅協調。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱心理狀態都好不穩定-故在警誡會面中將事情混淆&quot;&gt;趙稱「心理狀態都好不穩定」 故在警誡會面中將事情混淆&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，趙家賢在第二次錄影會面被問及「無差別」否決預算案的意思，趙表示鄒家成與林卓廷的代表曾於會議辯論，鄒提出一定要全面否決，但林卓廷的代表質疑：「係咪連個財政預算案，包括要起醫院呢啲你都否決？呢啲係一啲唔關政治嘅、一啲好民生嘅事項㗎喎。」因此趙指「無差別」並非討論預算案的細項是否需調整，而是要透過否決去啟動《基本法》條款，令行政長官解散立法會和辭職。趙確認是指4月14日的新東首次會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;警方亦問及除初選籌辦者的群組外，還有沒有其他關於初選的群組，當時趙回應戴開了7個 WhatsApp 群組，包括5個地區直選、超級區議會及衞生服務界，而由於傳統民主派與抗爭派就否決預算案的意見南轅北轍，故戴以群組作更新及發布訊息之用，如在選舉前通知「最新嘅情況咁樣啦，大家唔使簽嘢㗎啦」，趙確認戴確實在會上稱不需簽署文件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文問趙是否維持當時說法，趙表示「當時我相信我嘅記憶」，但補充「因為當時心理狀態都好不穩定嘅」，亦已超過4個月沒有接觸其電話，而他平日習慣會檢查電話以檢查遺忘的事情，因此他將 WhatsApp 的廣播名單（Broadcast）與群組「痴埋咗一嚿」。&lt;/p&gt;

These include strategic and tactical airlift; airborne tactical command and control (C2) and operational C2; air-to-air refueling; airborne intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); and electromagnetic warfare and suppression of enemy air defenses. These capabilities allow next-generation fighters like F-35s to operate effectively. At the moment, however, European air enabling capabilities are lacking. This brief outlines the need for air enablers and details the gaps in European capabilities before providing recommendations for how to fill those gaps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2002, just a few years removed from its operation in Kosovo, NATO convened its heads of state and government in Prague for an alliance summit. The Kosovo intervention had revealed shortcomings in the alliance’s “capacity to stage sustainable combat air operations,” at least without the United States bearing a disproportionate burden. NATO leaders were determined to address the matter. When they endorsed the summit declaration document, therefore, they noted among NATO’s military capability gaps a few areas that often receive less attention than big-ticket items like fighter aircraft, missile defense, or frigates: “intelligence, surveillance, and target acquisition; air-to-ground surveillance; command, control, and communications; strategic air and sea lift; [and] air-to-air refueling.” Allies committed to filling these gaps and promised to pursue this goal “vigorously.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nine years later, in 2011, NATO was again called to conduct an air campaign, this time in Libya. But the promises of 2002 had not been fulfilled: again, it was revealed that European allies could not act without the United States providing key air enabling capabilities. After another 10 years, in August 2021, Europe’s limitations were exposed yet again, as European countries relied on the United States to evacuate their citizens from Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In spite of appearances, however, Europe has made some progress over the past decade in closing this gap. Air enablers have become an area of tangible European defense cooperation, with NATO, the European Union, and their member states all working together. Nevertheless, European NATO allies and partners still do not possess sufficient air enabling capabilities for the security environment they face. Russia’s experience in Ukraine demonstrates that it is not only a country’s modern and sophisticated aerial capabilities that win fights, but the enablers that allow them to get to there, tell them where to go when they arrive, and minimize their exposure to enemy fire. Reports that, for example, Russia has held back from using its most sophisticated airborne systems because of their justifiable fear of Ukrainian air defense capabilities show that even with advanced fighter aircraft the inability to support those aircraft in the air can lead to mission failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brief will describe the most critical enablers in the air domain, make the case for why they are needed, outline the gaps in European capabilities, and provide some recommendations for how to fill those gaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-need-threat-perspective-and-strategic-analysis&quot;&gt;The Need: Threat Perspective and Strategic Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before discussing enabling capabilities in the air domain, it is critical to define terms and clarify what is considered an “enabling capability.” Unfortunately, there is no distinct definition or list of air enablers in NATO doctrine, nor is one readily available in the doctrines of member states. The definitions of enablers to air operations in adjacent writings have ranged from the mundane, like staff functions, to future technology such as artificial intelligence. For the purposes of this brief, the authors will define enablers as those combat capabilities that allow air forces to conduct air-to-air combat and strike missions, whether that be deep interdiction or supporting ground forces. Taking that into consideration, key enabling capabilities are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tactical Command and Control (C2): The direction and coordination of tactical forces to achieve operational objectives. In NATO and Western air forces, this is generally conducted by airborne C2 aircraft such as the E-3 AWACS (Airborne Warning and Control System) or ground-based deployable control facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Operational C2: The planning and coordination of operations to achieve strategic objectives. For the NATO air component, this is conducted at Air Operations Centers (AOCs).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Airlift: The use of cargo aircraft to move personnel and supplies. This can either be strategic or tactical. The former involves the use of large airlifters to move material or personnel over a long range, usually from outside a theater of operations into the theater. The latter refers to transport that happens within a single theater of operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aerial Refueling: The use of tanker aircraft to refuel other aircraft in flight to extend their operational range.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR): The coordinated acquisition, processing, and dissemination of accurate, relevant, and timely information and intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Electromagnetic Warfare (EW): The use of the electromagnetic spectrum, both offensively and defensively, to deny the adversary the use of the spectrum and protect allied use of it. The most commonly thought of case is the jamming of radar or communications.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD): The use of destructive or disruptive means to neutralize, destroy, or temporarily degrade adversary surface-to-air defenses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these enablers are of importance to a NATO air campaign. While a conflict with Russia is of primary concern to NATO given recent events in Ukraine, Russia’s failures in Ukraine also provide a valuable lesson on the importance of these enabling capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Russia began its invasion in February 2022, the Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS) held a significant numerical and technological advantage over the smaller Ukrainian Air Force. In planning and execution, however, the VKS made several critical mistakes in the use of its airpower, which contributed to Russian setbacks. Specifically, the VKS failed at SEAD and C2 in Ukraine, as well as at integrating intelligence. This has led to neither side gaining air superiority and has further exacerbated Russian ground force struggles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/AYPb5rd.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Russian S-400 Air Defense System.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does not mean that NATO should assume the VKS is a hollow force. In fact, much of its higher-end aircraft still remain active and its doctrine for confronting NATO is still viable. Russia has long believed that they are at a disadvantage in the air in relation to NATO and Western air forces. To counter this, they have invested heavily in advanced surface-based air defense (SBAD) systems to deny NATO aircraft the ability to fly in certain areas. While the poorly planned invasion of Ukraine did not follow Russian doctrine, should Russia learn from its mistakes and refocus on its doctrine, its military performance would likely be much improved. For instance, in a conflict with NATO in an area such as the Baltics where there is already overlapping areas of coverage as a result of the Russian Oblast of Kaliningrad, Russian SBAD capabilities would present a significant challenge to the operation of NATO air power capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To counter such a threat, NATO would need several enabling capabilities: ISR to quickly locate SBAD systems and other targets, EW and SEAD to degrade Russian SBAD capabilities, and tactical C2 to coordinate the effort. Furthermore, any large-scale operation also requires aerial refueling to provide aircraft with longer range and further coverage. Additionally, airlift may be required to enable the mobility of forces to complicate Russia’s offensive missile targeting. Unfortunately, some of these capabilities are either lacking in depth or concentrated in one country — the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a new problem. In the last large-scale NATO air campaign, Operation Unified Protector over Libya, several capabilities were also sorely lacking. During that operation, NATO was dependent on the United States for ISR, C2, and aerial refueling. This exposed limits in the alliance’s ability to conduct air operations without major assistance from the United States. Once operations turned over to NATO, the United States was meant to be a supporting force, providing only unique capabilities — and yet, it still flew over 50 percent of the sorties, providing 80 percent of ISR and aerial refueling, virtually all of the SEAD, and 25 percent of the airborne C2. In fact, in the early days of the campaign when the United States was attempting to be less involved, ISR was so lacking that a young U.S. officer working in the NATO AOC sent an impassioned and strongly worded email to their superiors bemoaning the state of affairs. This email quickly went viral in the halls of the Pentagon, and the United States soon allocated more support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A detailed RAND report from 2015 evaluating the air campaign in Libya recommended that NATO make a plan to address its reliance on U.S. enabling functions, such as ISR, Airborne C2, Aerial Refueling, and SEAD. There has been little positive movement in the years since; in fact, things have trended the opposite direction. For example, NATO is now wholly dependent on the United States for SEAD capabilities. These vignettes are just a few of the examples of enabling capability gaps that need to be addressed. The remainder of this report will examine these capabilities in depth and delineate where NATO countries need to invest for the future, particularly in situations where the forces of the United States might be heavily engaged elsewhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-state-of-existing-european-air-enabling-capabilities&quot;&gt;The State of Existing European Air Enabling Capabilities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start, it will be instructive to give the lay of the land for native European air enabling capabilities as the situation stands today. This is a two-part endeavor: first, to tally significant capabilities in Europe, and second, to describe pertinent multinational efforts that share capabilities across nations. Some are NATO-led; others are comprised of separate groupings of countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/2DY1RSd.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image2&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;NATO Boeing E-3A AWACS Airplane.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;relevant-systems-in-europe&quot;&gt;Relevant Systems in Europe&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tactical Command and Control (C2): NATO owns and operates 14 E-3A AWACS as part of its Airborne Early Warning and Control Force (NAEW&amp;amp;C Force). The alliance’s commonly funded military budget provides funds for the force. This is the oldest version of the AWACS still in use, and NATO is actively studying replacing it with a newer system. Some countries fly other planes to fulfill similar roles, such as variants of the EMB-145 (Greece), the Gulfstream G550 CAEW (Italy), or the E-3F Sentry (France), among others. There is a total of 21 aircraft in this latter category.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Operational C2: NATO has two Combined Air Operations Centers (AOCs), located in Uedem, Germany and Torrejón, Spain. This is in addition to the U.S. AOC at Ramstein AB in Germany; the UK Centre at High Wycombe; the NATO training AOC in Lyon, France; and the NATO deployable AOC stationed at Poggio Renatica, Italy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Airlift&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Strategic Lift: European allies and partners fulfill the requirement for strategic lift with a few different aircraft. To start, they own and operate 11 C-17 Globemasters; eight belong to the United Kingdom and three to a NATO-led consortium. Another consortium of European countries shares five AN-124-100 aircraft. All the rest are “multirole” aircraft: air tankers that are capable of strategic transport as well as aerial refueling. These constitute the vast majority of Europe’s strategic lift capability. For example, seven countries fly the A400M, owning between them a total of 107 aircraft. Additionally, NATO owns seven A330 MRTTs as part of its Multirole Tanker Transport Fleet; they are operated by a consortium of six allies. The United Kingdom flies ten more, and France five, for a total of 22 A330s.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tactical Lift: There are a number of relevant aircraft, including different variants of the C-130 Hercules, the Transall C-160, and the C-127 Spartan. All told, European countries operate roughly 125 such aircraft, with the vast majority being C-130 variants.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aerial Refueling: Relevant aircraft here include the A330 MRTT and A400M, as well as the A310 MRTT (a multirole aircraft for tactical lift), the KC-767, variants of the KC-130, and France’s specially modified C-135FR Stratotankers. Altogether, Europe has 156 such aircraft. The A330 MRTT and A400M aircraft have been counted twice, both in this category and under strategic lift. Without counting those multirole aircraft, there are only 27 dedicated refueling aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Tally of Select European Air Enablers.&lt;/strong&gt; Note: All data compiled by CSIS is from the IISS Military Balance 2023, unless indicated otherwise. Figures do not account for current operability of platforms. In the Comparable U.S. Total column, U.S. figures count those capabilities assigned to reserve forces and do not factor for current operability of platforms. Source: Author’s analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the remaining enablers, it is less instructive to look at precise quantity, as they rely less on big-ticket platforms and more on small assets — including uncrewed vehicles, missiles, and aircraft that can fulfill one of the below functions but have other primary missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR): Relevant capabilities run from drones like the MQ-9A Reaper, RQ-1B Predator, and Turkey’s many unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to aircraft like the C-160, RC-235, or Beech 350. Of aircraft suited to ISR tasks, European countries currently own and operate only roughly three dozen. Of UAVs, the number is approximately 200.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Electromagnetic Warfare (EW) and Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD): European air forces conduct EW primarily via the use of radar jammers and anti-radiation missiles. These are used for SEAD tasks as well, so they will be considered together. European capabilities are severely lacking here. Only two countries field some variant of the AGM-88 High Speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM): Germany and Italy. Both plan to retire their Tornado aircraft that are capable of shooting the HARM as early as 2025. The United Kingdom retired its anti-radiation missile-capable Tornados in 2019. No countries yet field the extended range variant of this missile, the AARGM-ER, nor do they possess the GBU-53B StormBreaker or the MBDA SPEAR 3 missiles. Furthermore, no European countries appear to have any variation of another useful capability: the MALD-X air-launched decoy/jammer. Currently, Europe’s airborne EW capabilities focus on aircraft self-defense and they possess no offensive EW platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/OTkqgOG.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image4&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Airbus A400M Multirole Aircraft.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;multinational-initiatives&quot;&gt;Multinational Initiatives&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most of the systems above, quantity is lacking. In some cases, Europeans have attempted to address this by integrating, coordinating, or pooling and sharing assets. C2, strategic airlift, and aerial refueling are especially unusual in that collectively held assets are already quite common in these areas. NATO is the key player but not the only one. A few multinational initiatives are of note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One is the NATO Airborne Early Warning and Control Force (NAEW&amp;amp;C Force), in which 19 allies participate. The 14 E-3A AWACS that comprise the force are unusual in that they are fully NATO-owned assets, as opposed to national aircraft made available for alliance operations. Their primary purpose is surveillance and battle management. According to NATO, the AWACS have significant capability: “three aircraft operating in overlapping, coordinated orbits can provide unbroken radar coverage of the whole of Central Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar NATO-owned fleet is the Multinational Multi-Role Tanker Transport Fleet (MMF), which flies the seven A330 MRTTs mentioned above. These aircraft can conduct both strategic transport and aerial refueling missions. Although NATO owns the aircraft, they were acquired via the Organization for Joint Armament Cooperation (OCCAR), acting on behalf of the NATO Support and Procurement. The European Defence Agency (EDA) led the overall initiative. All six participating NATO allies can access the MMF capabilities. The project demonstrates that European defense cooperation can help fill capability gaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two similar initiatives are the Strategic Airlift Capability (SAC) and the Strategic Airlift International Solution (SALIS). Both are programs where capabilities are pooled and held collectively, as opposed to remaining national assets. The SAC consortium holds three C-17 Globemaster aircraft; it includes 10 NATO allies as well as Sweden and Finland. NATO’s Heavy Airlift Wing operates the aircraft and another NATO agency provides administrative support. Despite NATO’s role, however, participating countries can request the aircraft for national, EU, or even UN missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SALIS holds five AN-124-100 aircraft. Any consortium member can request access; the aircraft can be used for NATO missions, as well as EU or national ones. The consortium consists of nine NATO allies. It is coordinated, however, by a non-NATO entity: the Movement Coordination Centre Europe (MCCE), which comprises 28 member states from across the European Union and NATO. The center considers itself “brokers for strategic lift issues.” It cannot direct its members to provide assets, however; it can only rely on their voluntary willingness to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/s3uBv8y.png&quot; alt=&quot;image5&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: Movement Coordination Centre Europe Membership.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Author’s analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MCCE resembles a smaller multinational body that coordinates air enablers: the European Air Transport Command (EATC). Its seven members not only coordinate their lift and aerial refueling assets — they pool them under a single joint command, which oversees joint operations. The fleet includes 150 assets spread across seven national air bases. A new Franco-German tactical air transport squadron will fly under the command of the EATC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dizzying array of initiatives gives the impression that airlift and refueling are robust areas of defense collaboration. In a sense, this is true. More than in most areas, European nations have been willing to make concessions on absolute sovereignty over military assets, whether by making a national aircraft available to a multinational pool or even by allowing pilots to fly operations under a joint command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, the proliferation of agencies, entities, and centers seems motivated by — and in part obscures — the apparent fact that Europe lacks the needed number of relevant systems. At a recent CSIS workshop, a participant compared the bureaucratic activity to “moving the deck chairs on the Titanic.” The participant also noted that members designed these initiatives to reduce European reliance on the United States for crisis-management missions like Operation Unified Protector — not for conventional war against Russia. This may explain their emphasis on strategic airlift, as opposed to tactical lift within theater. To the extent that they increase efficiency, these coordinating bodies likely have value. But this value should not be confused with what is probably more necessary: closing the critical capability gaps by investing in the necessary quantity of systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;notable-forthcoming-capabilities&quot;&gt;Notable Forthcoming Capabilities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some reasons for optimism. In the realm of strategic lift and aerial refueling, the A400M is an example of improvement. The number of operational A400M aircraft in Europe increased from 97 in 2022 to 106 in 2023, with deliveries to France, Belgium, Germany, Spain, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. And those seven countries are still waiting for more: there are 59 aircraft yet to be delivered, which will further bolster Europe’s strategic lift and aerial refueling capability (see below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ZVYsvhZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image6&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3: European Acquisitions of A400M Atlas Transport Aircraft.&lt;/strong&gt; *Recent reporting indicates that the United Kingdom is considering acquiring an additional six A400M aircraft, which would bring the total number of forthcoming planes to 65. See Tim Martin, &lt;a href=&quot;https://breakingdefense.com/2023/02/raf-defends-decision-behind-2-year-tactical-airlift-capability-gap-plans-additional-a400m-buy/&quot;&gt;“RAF defends decision behind 2-year tactical airlift capability gap, plans additional A400M buy,” Breaking Defense, February 2, 2023&lt;/a&gt;. Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://airbus.web.factory.eu.airbus.com/sites/g/files/jlcbta136/files/2023-02/2023-01_MRS_GEN_Ord-Deliv%20by%20country_0.pdf&quot;&gt;“Orders, Deliveries, In Operation Military Aircraft by Country - Worldwide,” Airbus, January 31, 2023&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other aircraft will swell Europe’s ranks in the coming years. In addition to the forthcoming A400Ms, the MMF is expected to receive two more A330 MRTT planes by 2024. Between 2023 and 2025, Spain intends to add three to its own national fleet. France is also waiting on four. Regarding tactical lift, Portugal is reportedly acquiring five Embraer KC-390 medium transport aircraft, a variant of the C-390 Millennium that is also configured for aerial or on-ground refueling. The Netherlands has plans to replace its four C-130s with the same, and Hungary has also ordered two. Slovenia also intends to buy two C-27J aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These acquisitions seem to reflect a growing awareness among some smaller European militaries that a degree of native air enabling capability is desirable: Portugal, Hungary, and the Netherlands, for example, all currently lack any nationally held aerial refueling or multirole tanker/transport aircraft. On the other hand, some countries are moving in the opposite direction: Germany has retired its A310 MRTT fleet but reportedly is not replacing them with national capabilities, opting instead to rely on the NATO MRTT fleet for the needed enabling capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union is also seeking a role in the development of air enabling capabilities, albeit in a less concrete way. Via its Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) framework, it is assisting five member states to develop a future platform for strategic airlift by means of the Strategic Air Transport for Outsized Cargo (SATOC) program. It is not clear that the program will result in the actual delivery of new aircraft in a relevant timeframe. The bloc is pursuing a similar project for tactical lift via the Future Medium-Sized Tactical Cargo project (FMTC), but it is limited to defining requirements for what EU tactical airlift fleets might look like after 2035. Another project aspires to develop an EW jamming capability, and another to “potentially” adopt a joint EW concept of operations, which itself “might include . . . the establishment of a joint EW unit.” Another small project will fund research into a new hose and drogue system for existing tanker aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With respect to airborne C2, a few developments are notable. For one, NATO is currently undertaking a modernization program for its E-3A AWACS, which it plans to retire and replace around 2035. At the moment, the program is in early stages: in 2022, the NSPA reportedly awarded three contracts to defense industry competitors to develop technical concepts for how to replace NATO’s aerial surveillance and C2 capability, based on proposals the companies had submitted in an earlier round. The United Kingdom will add to this capability when it replaces its retired fleet of E-3D Sentry aircraft with three modern E-7 AEW&amp;amp;C planes — the same aircraft that the United States intends to acquire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding aerial ISR, some European countries, such as the Netherlands and Poland, have plans to acquire MQ-9 Reaper UAVs. Finland has also conducted test flights with the drone. France also an ongoing program under its 2019–2025 Loi de Programmation Militaire to develop a light ISR aircraft. One of these modified Beechcraft 350 aircraft has already been delivered to the French Air Force; Paris intends to field a second by 2025, out of an eventual six.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another notable initiative is the “Eurodrone” project. A three-company consortium is developing the modern, twin-turboprop uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) for Spain, France, Italy, and Germany. OCCAR has acted as the contracting authority. The Eurodrone’s main mission will be ISTAR (intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance) — notably including armed ISTAR (i.e., ground support). The consortium will make 60 total UAVs. It projects the first flight for 2026 and delivery of the first aircraft for 2029. If successful, the project will add a needed ISR and combat capability to Europe’s repertoire, the former of which is a perennial low-density, high-demand area. Project leaders also hope it will represent a success story for European defense collaboration and the European defense industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/2hwDHnB.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image7&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;German chancellor Olaf Scholz (center) in front of Eurodrone.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, with respect to EW and SEAD, the European defense company MBDA — a “joint venture” of Airbus, BAE Systems, and Leonardo — is currently developing the SPEAR-EW missile. According to MBDA, this variant of the SPEAR missile will provide jamming and decoy capability “across the threat spectrum” and will be able to be deployed on F-35 fighters as well as, reportedly, the future sixth-generation UK-Japan-Italy fighter. Other than the UK Royal Air Force, it is not clear which, if any, European countries will buy the missile. Italy’s recent announcement that it wishes to convert six Gulfstream aircraft into EC-37B Compass Call offensive EW aircraft is an extremely positive development. The United States should approve this sale in order to bolster European capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;capability-gaps&quot;&gt;Capability Gaps&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these forthcoming capabilities, nearly every area mentioned here represents a capability gap. As Figure 1 shows, Europe lags well behind the United States in several areas. The differences in terms of airborne C2 (roughly 35 relevant European platforms compared to over 120 U.S. aircraft) and air-to-air refueling (about 150 to almost 450) are particularly stark. The disparity in aerial ISR assets is also notable: Europe has a few dozen relevant aircraft to 150 for the United States, and roughly 200 UAVs to over 900 for the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to strategic airlift, AAR, and ISR, Europeans have been transparent about the shortfalls. In its Strategic Compass released in March 2022, for example, the European Union mentioned strategic airlift and ISR capabilities as critical gaps to “substantially reduce” by 2025. In November, the EU Coordinated Annual Review on Defence (CARD) also identified strategic air transport as one of the “shortfalls corresponding to strategic enablers” that EU member states should address. France’s inability to conduct operations in the Sahel without U.S. air enablers likely motivated these inclusions. As recently as 2021, the United States also provided ISR, C2, and strategic and tactical lift for NATO’s Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding EW and SEAD, as the previous section notes, Europeans are currently reliant on the United States. According to a recent RUSI report, “no European NATO air forces currently have sufficient expertise or the required munitions stocks to conduct suppression and destruction of enemy air defences (SEAD/DEAD) at scale.” The lack of HARM missiles, especially the most modern version, is also problematic — particularly given the reports from Ukraine that they have been extremely effective. This too echoes the finding of a prior CSIS report, which found that the lack of long-range, high-speed radar-homing missiles for SEAD among Europeans could be a significant issue in a Russia fight, particularly as concerns the defense of the Baltic allies. It is therefore a serious gap in European capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-for-filling-gaps&quot;&gt;Recommendations for Filling Gaps&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to European military capabilities, words are cheap. Consider again the 2002 Prague Summit Declaration, which, it will be remembered, flagged ISR, C2, airlift, and air-to-air refueling as “continuing capability shortfalls.” The same document said the following: “We will take the necessary steps to improve capabilities in the identified areas of continuing capability shortfalls . . . We are committed to pursuing vigorously capability improvements.” These promises were not realized by the time of Operation Unified Protector. Since then, some progress has been made on airlift and AAR but not enough — and, in the meantime, EW/SEAD has emerged as yet another capability gap in the area of air-based enablers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although some of the raw numbers in earlier sections may imply Europe is in a decent state, should a major conflict with Russia break out, it will be woefully ill prepared. To start, Europe currently has little to no SEAD capabilities to speak of, a crucial enabler when faced with the Russian A2/AD network. Second, almost half of European tactical C2 aircraft are older and near the end of their lifetime. Furthermore, the relatively low number of these tactical C2 aircraft may not be robust enough to run the type of large continuous air campaign that would be required if Europe’s air forces were to go head-to-head with the VKS. Finally, NATO needs to adopt a concept similar to the U.S. Air Force’s (USAF) Agile Combat Employment (ACE) doctrine for use in the European theater, which would likely require in turn investments in tactical lift aircraft. In order to fill these gaps, European countries will need to decide whether these relatively unglamorous capabilities are worth the investment, think creatively, and look for opportunities for collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the final point, recent CSIS research that conceptualized European defense cooperation as a collective action problem outlines several principles that, if adopted, correlate with successful initiatives: (1) use the power of small groups, (2) normalize cooperation, and (3) incentivize cooperation to discourage fragmentation. As previously noted, air enablers have in the past decade been unusual in that these principles are already being followed in certain areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;if-it-aint-broke&quot;&gt;If It Ain’t Broke&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has a dedicated Air Mobility command for “strategic and tactical airlift, air-to-air refuelling and aeromedical evacuation.” It is tempting to say that Europe should copy the U.S. example and consolidate the bureaucratic entities discussed above into a single outfit — their functions centralized within, for example, the NATO chain of command, the MCCE, or the EATC. The presumption would be that this would streamline the process of making assets available when something goes wrong and they are needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is not clear that this is currently a problem. There is not publicly available evidence that the MCCE, the EATC, or the various NATO and EU bodies have failed to execute on any mission or operation as a result of excessive administrative or bureaucratic entanglement or red tape. This seems to be a case where the principle of normalizing cooperation has in fact led to an effective system. The problem, therefore, seems to come back to the quantity of platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;prioritize-the-russia-fight&quot;&gt;Prioritize the Russia Fight&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When NATO adopted its new Strategic Concept at the Madrid Summit in June 2022, it de facto elevated collective defense above NATO’s other core tasks, calling it the alliance’s “key purpose.” The decisions taken at the Madrid Summit reinforced this prioritization, as have NATO’s actions since then. It follows that Europeans should emphasize, in doctrine and in budgets, air enabling capabilities that most enable a successful defense (and deterrent) against Russian aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To that end, a participant at a recent CSIS workshop identified airborne ISR and air mobility (airlift) as the two areas that European countries ought to prioritize. In the case of the former, the participant emphasized uncrewed systems, as those would be the assets the United States would most likely take out of the European theater in the event of an Indo-Pacific contingency. In the case of the latter, Europeans have made substantial investments in strategic airlift, as discussed above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in the case of a conventional fight with Russia, tactical lift may be the most needed. Some European countries seem to be going the opposite direction: the United Kingdom, for example, is retiring its 14 C-130J Hercules tactical lift aircraft in favor of the A400M. France has also invested heavily in the A400M. While the A400M is capable of tactical airlift, it is not specifically designed for this purpose, and there may be a tension if a simultaneous need arises for strategic airlift. In the last year, only Poland added new, operational planes to its fleet of tactical aircraft. The small number of forthcoming aircraft detailed in Section Four are not likely to be sufficient to enable NATO to ensure the large-scale mobility of materiel in and around Europe, should conflict erupt with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This mobility could be essential and should replicate, as stated above, the USAF’s ACE doctrine. ACE is the proactive and reactive movement of forces around theater to complicate an adversary’s targeting solution and timeline and preserve friendly forces through the inherent defense of movement. While not specifically the U.S. ACE doctrine, the Ukrainian Air Force has been successful in complicating Russia’s targeting by dispersing their aircraft to alternate, non-traditional bases and remaining agile to avoid Russian missile attacks. Key to expanding this type of pursuit to the whole of Europe is the airlift capacity to move supplies and support personnel around the continent — in other words, pilots must be able to land on any European airbase and be sure that the base will have what is needed to service their aircraft. This is where modern tactical airlift capacity becomes critical. It follows that European NATO allies, perhaps deploying the principle of small groups via joint procurement, should prioritize investments here. The European Union could play a key role in this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to EW and SEAD, European countries ought to invest to counter Russia’s vast Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) capabilities. Specifically, European nations should consider a SEAD missile compatible with their F-35 fleets such as the AARGM-ER or the future SPEAR-EW. Additionally, nations should consider investing in EW capabilities that are compatible with the future U.S. Electromagnetic Battle Management (EMBM) and Cognitive EW systems. This will ensure NATO allies are able to jointly coordinate the fight in the electromagnetic spectrum across the EMBM network and respond to unexpected threats in near-real time via Cognitive EW techniques. This will require aircraft purchases and upgrades that include software open system architecture and software-defined radios in order to link in with the future systems via software updates, as opposed to more expensive hardware buys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;seek-opportunities-for-specialization&quot;&gt;Seek Opportunities for Specialization&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cases, it makes sense for European militaries to opt for proportionately large investments in certain capabilities and abstain from investing in others. For example, some experts have noted that SEAD is an area where European air forces would need to specialize in order to do it effectively. Since the F-35 is an EW-capable aircraft that will soon be able to use the newest AARGM-ER (extended-range) HARM and the SPEAR EW, it may be wise for one European air force that flies it — or a small group, in accordance with the second collective action principle — to assume primary responsibility for European EW capabilities. The logic here is that EW/SEAD is a highly complex task that requires a significant amount of training and exercising, not to mention investment in the anti-radiation missiles and other technologies needed to do it effectively. Italy or Germany, as they already have some experience with the mission, would be viable candidates to take on this role, even if they make must budgetary sacrifices elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;european-union-use-the-principle-of-incentivizing-cooperation&quot;&gt;European Union: Use the Principle of Incentivizing Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union is increasingly finding itself as an actor in security and defense. But its projects are often limited in ambition and financing. Nonetheless, it has tools it can bring to bear, including the EDA’s expertise on harmonizing requirements, financial capacity to incentivize joint procurement, and — if member states were to raise their level of ambition — even possibly the ability to pool or borrow large amounts of money to directly procure military hardware as a bloc. In any case, politics and practicality dictate that any new methods — or significant expansions of existing methods — would need a project to act as proof of concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the sake of argument, one potential project emerges from the analysis above. Tactical airlift is a critical enabling capability in a collective defense contingency vis-à-vis Russia, whether or not NATO adopts a version of the USAF’s ACE doctrine. Furthermore, as mentioned above, there is already a pertinent EU PESCO project, FMTC. Intra-Europe military mobility is an EU defense priority, as well as a priority area for EU-NATO cooperation. Finally, the three tactical aircraft that Europe flies — the C-130, C-295, and C-27J — are reportedly “approaching the end of their lifecycle in the upcoming decade.” It is logical therefore that this is an area where the European Union should focus its efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The forthcoming European Defense Investment Program (EDIP) will build on an existing program and should combine funding with incentives like tax waivers to encourage joint procurement. It could adopt the FMTC project — which has only just been launched and is limited in scope — as a flagship program, which will enable in turn a potential replication of the ACE concept at the NATO level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;united-states&quot;&gt;United States&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States can assist its European allies by considering four key suggestions. First, it can encourage cooperative developments in European defense — as well as consider joint and interoperable transatlantic procurement with European allies — specifically in the area of software open system architecture. Second, there is a need to be open with European allies about U.S. capabilities that cannot be reliably assumed to remain in the European theater, especially in the event of a contingency in the Indo-Pacific. Third, the U.S. Department of Defense should spread the U.S. “distributed and collaborative” concept of Cognitive EW to European allies and partners and include European partners in the development of that system, as well as the EMBM system. This also goes for the Agile Combat Employment doctrine. Finally, there are strong arguments in favor of the United States considering ways to increase classified information-sharing with allies and close partners, particularly those using similar U.S.-made equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the United States and NATO should learn from Russia’s failures in Ukraine and their own shortcomings in Libya. Critical air enabling capabilities may not garner media attention, but they are needed to win the fights for which the United States and its European allies and partners are preparing. The Euro-Atlantic community did not fill this gap between 1999 and 2011, nor between 2011 and 2023. How wide will the gap be in another 12 years?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（14日）踏入審訊第43天。趙家賢今接受代表林卓廷和黃碧雲的大狀沈士文盤問，同意因民主派光譜不同，要協調他們當選後行為幾乎不可能，而較新晉、無政黨的抗爭派亦令選舉協調困難增加。趙又同意，民主黨「絕對支持」中國回復對香港主權，稱黨歌歌詞有「香江終於歸中國，兩制相輔開新天」。他亦同意，林卓廷和黃碧雲絕對是民主黨政策的堅定支持者，時任黨主席胡志偉亦同樣，指他作為倡導政策的主席沒理由不支持。惟法官陳慶偉笑言不能確定，指「我們見識過政治」，舉例蘇聯共產黨的戈爾巴喬夫也不支持其黨政策，有被告大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙同意民主派光譜不一-民主動力要協調當選後行為幾乎不可能&quot;&gt;趙同意民主派光譜不一 民主動力要協調當選後行為幾乎不可能&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢今接受代表林卓廷和黃碧雲的大律師沈士文盤問。趙家賢確認，於2012年開始參與民主動力工作，2014年成為召集人，民主動力工作為協調民主派參選，以免票源相撞，而協調時需聚集本土抗爭派和傳統民主派，但因兩者的價值觀等本質不同，故要協調出選名單本身已非常困難。趙亦同意，民主動力工作從不是要協調當選者進入議會後要做什麼，而且因兩派光譜不同，故要協調他們當選後做什麼亦是幾乎不可能。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱民主黨支持中國對港主權及一國兩制否決財案與否需經中委會討論&quot;&gt;趙稱民主黨支持中國對港主權及「一國兩制」、否決財案與否需經中委會討論&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙同意，民主黨和社民連同屬傳統民主派，而傳統民主派的特質包括他們有政治聯繫，在參與本港選舉有很長的歷史；而本土抗爭派則大部分不屬任何攻黨，選舉對他們而言較新。沈士文續問，民主黨是否支持中國回復對香港的主權？趙指「呢個絕對支持，我哋黨歌都有『香江終於歸中國，兩制相輔開新天』」，林卓廷和黃碧雲相視而笑。趙亦同意，民主黨支持《基本法》和一國兩制，亦會在支持者接受下盡可能與政府合作，該做法至少自2012至2020年也維持。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 黃碧雲&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢曾供稱，民主黨代表莊榮輝曾在新東會議上，表示不獲授權代表民主黨進行表決，趙指莊的行為與他對民主黨的了解一致。趙同意，議員當選後會怎樣做對黨是很重要的事，需經中委會討論，亦需考慮支持者的意見，並指民主黨有立法會黨團，議員會就重要議題商討，盡量確保立場一致。趙同意，因為民主黨上述立場，他作為民動召集人要協調民主黨黨員當選後的行為是幾乎不可能，亦非民動職責，強調民動多年來只是獲傳統民主派授權進行選舉協調。沈續指，趙的協調工作變得更困難，因為本土抗爭派較新晉，且沒有政治聯繫，可以自行做決定？趙同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱林卓廷黃碧雲和胡志偉堅定支持民主黨政策-官提戈爾巴喬夫指黨主席或有不同議程&quot;&gt;趙稱林卓廷、黃碧雲和胡志偉堅定支持民主黨政策 官提戈爾巴喬夫指黨主席或有不同議程&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙同意，於2004年加入民主黨，曾於2010年至2014年任兩屆中委會委員，知道黃碧雲是創黨成員，亦知道林卓廷很早加入，辯方稱是於1999年。沈士文問，他是否認為黃碧雲和林卓廷是「典型傳統民主派」？法官李運騰一度問是什麼時間點，笑言80年代和90年代的民主派可能不同，陳慶偉亦問何為「典型傳統民主派」。沈士文和陳慶偉其後改問，直至趙加入民主黨後，是否認為黃碧雲和林卓廷是民主黨政策的堅定支持者（firm supporters）？趙答「絕對係」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡問那胡志偉呢？此時陳慶偉哈哈大笑。趙表示：「回應法官閣下，佢係黨主席當時。」陳仲衡再問，那他會否視胡志偉為民主黨政策的堅定支持者？趙再指：「回應法官閣下，佢係黨主席，佢係有份倡導決定政策嘅，咁冇理由唔會支持呢個政策嘅。」惟陳慶偉指，「你不能如此咬定，你看，我們見識過政治（we have seen politics），蘇聯共產黨的戈爾巴喬夫也不支持他政黨的政策，所以作為黨主席可能會有不同的議程（agenda）」，林卓廷大笑，又與黃碧雲對視而笑。陳終笑指，所以趙不能說因為胡志偉是主席就必然會有此看法，但那也是趙的答案。沈士文則指稍後會談到九東，續就另一議題發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/nVRyKHz.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（14日）踏入審訊第43天。趙家賢繼續接受盤問，確認辦初選的初心僅為民主派集中選票，而非否決預算案，感覺被戴耀廷和部分本土派「騎劫」，但承認當時沒有表達。惟法官庭上引述多份民主動力文件，質疑從沒提及被騎劫，其中有署名「趙家賢」的感謝信稱初選「創出民主運動的壯舉」，法官陳仲衡直言趙「不像是火車或客機被騎劫的受害者，除非你患上斯德哥爾摩症候群」，惟趙稱文件非由他所撰；法官陳慶偉亦指趙一直指責戴為「大文豪」、「大思想家」，卻於記者會感謝戴耀廷，趙解釋是「互送高帽」，「壓抑」對戴耀廷的真實感受，多人大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，法官李運騰關注趙答應承辦初選前，是否已留意到初選出現「反政府」和「反建制」的傾向、且越來越強，趙同意，指「當時整個社會嘅氣氛都係咁」；而他仍答應承辦初選，是望民主動力有崗位協助民主運動，不想被邊緣化或「衰喺我手上」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙2021年6月首次錄口供稱感被戴耀廷騎劫利用有責任協助當局&quot;&gt;趙2021年6月首次錄口供稱感被戴耀廷騎劫利用、有責任協助當局&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢繼續接受代表林卓廷和黃碧雲的大律師沈士文盤問。沈展示趙於2021年6月29日進行的首次警誡錄影會面謄本，趙表示辦初選的初心純粹是提供「初選服務」，讓市民投選心儀候選人，及進行民意調查讓候選人獲支持繼續選舉工程，「咁但係成件事情好明顯就係，即係我個人同埋民主動力都係被利用，同埋係被騎劫咗嘅」。他續指，其初心只是望增大民主陣營，集中票源取得更多議席，但整個過程卻一步步變成要影響政府穩妥運作，「咁所以即係我會覺得係有責任，係協助當局呢，係要將成件事去理解清楚，而我都好係自願地，係好願意去配合，去講出真實事實嘅情況出嚟」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙同意上述是他當時的看法，即有被騎劫和利用的印象，強調「我當時係咁諗」。法官李運騰追問趙其後的想法是否有變？趙回答：「當時我係會覺得完全係好無辜」，但亦認為就「一啲盡責審查、謹慎責任，其實我作為召集人如果做得更加好嘅話，應該係避免咗成個民主動力仝人係會牽涉喺件事當中」。李續問，趙至現在是否仍然有被騎劫的感覺？趙稱「有嘅」，但再強調：「不過我自己要檢討返我各方面嘅責任。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢指初心不包括戴耀廷-稱被戴及部分本土派騎劫&quot;&gt;趙家賢指「初心」不包括戴耀廷 稱被戴及部分本土派「騎劫」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢於2021年7月21日進行第二次錄影會面，當時他主動補充首次會面的內容，表示作為溫和民主派想做「政界調解員角色」，而他和民主動力獲委託承辦初選時，「我哋個初心係好清楚」，就是希望提供一個平台予市民投票表達意見，揀選他們心目中最適切的民主派民主陣營代表，集中選票選出代表進入立法會，及希望立法會內有多些民主派人士。趙確認上述說的4點就是全部的「初心」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問到，趙提及「我哋個初心係好清楚」，他使用「我哋」是否不單代表他本人，亦包括民主動力、戴耀廷及區諾軒？趙表示包括他本人、民主動力相關人士及區諾軒。李追問即不包括戴耀廷？趙堅定說：「絕對冇。」李再問，即基本上趙是指他被戴耀廷騎劫？趙同意並補充：「同埋部份嘅本土抗爭派。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱感戴耀廷想踢開民動唔接好過接-惟鍾錦麟稱區諾軒會拉得住戴遂答應&quot;&gt;趙稱感戴耀廷想「踢開」民動、「唔接好過接」 惟鍾錦麟稱區諾軒「會拉得住戴」遂答應&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉續指，趙的證供很清楚，就是嘗試在他和區諾軒與戴耀廷之間「劃界」，並再問當趙答應承辦初選時，他的初心是包括戴在內嗎？趙思考數秒後，陳決定先小休予趙思考。趙其後回答問題，先談及民主動力同意承辦初選的經過，指起初戴耀廷其實認為可以不用找民主動力，而是直接找香港民意研究所做眾籌和初選，但民研不同意，並指曾與民動合作，提議戴找民動簽約，故戴才找趙和民動承辦初選。趙續指，戴詢問他時他「思考緊」，「當時我嘅睇法就係本身都係想踢開民主動力啦，突然間又搵返，第一下個諗法，總係覺得，唔接好過接嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟趙指，因他們正思考時，戴耀廷已向協調會議與會者稱邀請了民主動力，令他和民動「有一個壓力喺度」。而趙其後諮詢副召集人鍾錦麟，鍾認為「有區諾軒喺度呢，係會拉得住戴耀廷」，因區任民陣召集人時與不同派別光譜有良好關係，趙亦知區諾軒就初選的初心；而他們亦知道若沒有初選，民主派便會「搶票搶得好犀利」，故趙作為召集人「最後決定」承辦初選。趙指，因此錄影會面談及「我哋嘅初心」時，是包括「我、民主動力嘅相關人士同埋區諾軒」，並同意他是被區諾軒邀請參與「35+計劃」，從區得知計劃的初心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指否決預算案非35初心-知戴提攬炒-惟無表達己見&quot;&gt;趙指否決預算案非「35+」初心 知戴提「攬炒」 惟無表達己見&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文續引趙早前稱，若他一早得知戴耀廷的「攬炒」主張，就不會答應承辦初選？趙答：「冇錯，絕對不會」，並同意戴「攬炒十步」首兩步預期民主派會被DQ、由 Plan B 繼續參選，並在立法會取得35+議席，均是「35+計劃」的初心；至於第四步後提及否決政府撥款和預算案是否計劃的初心，趙則指「完全冇咁樣嘅思考」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續指，趙家賢或沒有這樣想，但趙亦曾提及協調會議上曾討論「會運用」或「會積極運用」否決權，公民黨亦於3月記者會已談及否決預算案。趙同意當時已對此有認知，重申當時有「拉扯」，溫和及本土派就該倡議「好似大家鬥講言論」以爭取支持。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文再引錄影會面謄本，趙提及列席協調會時，聽過戴耀廷提及要積極運用基本法權力否決預算案及如何「攬炒」政權。沈問因此趙當時意識到戴的說法？趙同意，稱是「好標題式咁樣」。沈續引趙提及，會上有本土抗爭派同意附和戴的說法，「咁我嗰陣時都有認知個情況，咁但係就礙於當時，即係作為一個只係叫做列席會議嘅人士，就冇特別去表達意見。但係我心裏面就好清楚係，就係絕對不認同有關嘅建議同做法。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官關注趙知初選反建制趨勢仍答應辦初選-趙認不想組織邊緣化衰喺我手上&quot;&gt;官關注趙知初選「反建制」趨勢仍答應辦初選 趙認不想組織邊緣化、「衰喺我手上」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙同意有上述想法時，他還未答應承辦初選。沈士文問，趙雖不同意戴的看法，但沒有向他表達，是否因他理解否決預算案並非計劃的初心？趙同意，重申否決財案「絕對唔係關於初選嘅事情」。李運騰續問，有趣的是趙於3月開始出席不同協調會議，亦獲助手匯報會議情況，他有否留意到人們對否決預算案有更強烈的意見和討論？趙指有留意到。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續問，那趙會否認為有危險的傾向？趙稱當時不認為危險，因戴耀廷有解釋這是《基本法》制定的流程和憲制權利。李運騰指他不是指違法的危險，而是運動開始出現「反政府（anti-government）」和「反建制（anti-establishment）」的傾向，且越來越強烈，趙同意，指「當時整個社會嘅氣氛都係咁」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續指，即使趙意識到此，仍於5月正式答應承辦初選？趙重申「當時社會氣氛個背景係咁樣」，而他認為民主動力作為民主派一分子，希望可以繼續有角色和崗位協助民主運動，「我唔想自己承繼咗個組織嘅營運，然後個組織叫做係被邊緣化或者衰喺我手上」。李運騰問，他是否想繼續在鎂光燈之下（under the spotlight），即想他的組織是整個計劃的一分子？趙答「有相關、有參與」，其後並同意辯方指，在意識到民主派就否決預算案有拉扯下，仍繼續承辦初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文其後續引趙錄影會面，趙重申承辦初選後發覺有本土抗爭派逐步逐步「騎劫初選」，將「攬炒」等倡議慢慢帶出和討論，覺得「越嚟越係有問題」，但礙於初選已進行，認為使命上「應該都要完成好我哋呢個初心」。惟趙指越來越發覺初選被「扭曲」，終決定退出初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;民主動力眾籌頁提光復香港-趙稱由兼職同事所撰出咗事&quot;&gt;民主動力眾籌頁提「光復香港」 趙稱由兼職同事所撰、「出咗事」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢庭上屢提及被「騎劫」，惟法官陳仲衡今主動要求展示4份文件質疑。陳先要求展示民主動力發起的「35+計劃」眾籌頁面，當中「公民投票背景」提及「暴政又於今年加推國歌法、國安法，對港人的輾壓施暴變本加厲…身為命運共同體，不止遊行、集會、聲援被捕手足，堅持五大訴求…亦要於議會、國際、日常生活的文宣等不同戰線繼續努力，才可擺脫極權魔爪…要光復香港的其中一步，就是團結一致，繼續內外抗爭…合計過半，才可光復立法會，奪回控制權，壓制港共政權，再繼而改革政制，建立民主政府。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙確認知道有關頁面，但主動補充指，因自己不熟悉眾籌平台的操作，所以全部交由民主動力總幹事黎敬輝處理。他續指黎曾將版面給予他看，但他當時只集中在版面應放置甚麼相片，內容上則完全信靠黎，但他強調：「呢度我都係要承擔責任，冇做好謹慎責任睇清楚當中一啲字眼」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡續問，根據該文件，趙是否仍然認為他及民主動力被騎劫？趙表示他之後得知眾籌版面所刊出的字眼，「喺我角度會用『出咗事』嚟形容」，並指當時他叫黎報告，「佢都係搵咗一啲兼職嘅同事幫手草擬」。陳追問：「所以你是被兼職同事騎劫？（“So you were hijacked by some part-time staff?”）」，旁聽席和被告席均傳來笑聲，趙回應：「我又唔可以話騎劫，所以我頭先講話要負謹慎責任」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢稱民動就35好多事情最後先知和排除在外-包括投票系統&quot;&gt;趙家賢稱民動就「35+」好多事情「最後先知」和「排除在外」 包括投票系統&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡其後要求展示民主動力2020年10月的會議記錄，提及趙家賢匯報因民主動力及戴耀廷受到國務院及港澳辦嚴厲譴責，民主動力為免繼續被打壓而退出協調工作。陳質疑趙當時並無提及他本人或民主動力被騎劫，趙同意在文字記錄中沒有這個意思，但強調曾與執委會成員講述被騎劫一事。他續指，當日會上主要討論民主動力與香港民意研究所合作的關係，而紀錄是由黎敬輝及另一職員負責，他們重點記錄此內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續主動解釋，民主動力曾與香港民意研究所簽約，但「事實上好多事情民主動力都係最後先知同埋排除在外」。他舉例，民主動力2017及2018年負責新東及九西補選初選，當年仍在香港大學轄下的香港民意計劃，就投票系統的介面操作等，「係好清楚一步步比我哋睇咗、同意咗先繼續去做嘅」，亦會即時向他匯報每小時投票數字；但在「35+計劃」中，投票系統已研發好、義工亦正進行訓練，民主動力「根本最後先至知道」系統操作，就投票數字亦「追得好辛苦，或者根本全部畀咗戴耀廷知，戴耀廷公布咗之後民主動力先知」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙於感謝函指投票日創出民主運動壯舉官質疑不像被騎劫-除非患斯德哥爾摩症候群&quot;&gt;趙於感謝函指投票日「創出民主運動壯舉」官質疑不像被騎劫 除非患「斯德哥爾摩症候群」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡其後再要求展示一封2020年10月，下款為「民主動力召集人 趙家賢博士」的感謝函，題目提及「感謝推動『2020立法會選民登記行動』及民主派 35+ 公民投票」，上款為致「十八區區議會民主派議員」。陳仲衡問這份信函是否並非由兼職同事撰寫？被告和旁聽人士均發笑，趙回應是總幹事黎敬輝草擬。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡續指，信函提及趙對「35+計劃」的感受，形容初選投票是「創出民主運動的壯舉」，又指如此看來，「你不像是火車或客機被劫持的受害者，除非你患上斯德哥爾摩症候群（“It doesn’t sound like you were a victim of a hijacked train, or a hijacked plane, unless you suffer from Stockholm syndrome.”）」，這時林卓廷大笑、余慧明亦掩嘴笑，在延伸庭的眾被告亦大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙解釋，信函目的是感謝協助選民登記及初選票站的民主派議員，並邀他們參與「民主派地區發展協調機制」改革小組；而他看畢黎敬輝的草擬本後認為有字眼需要更改，因此未有簽署和發出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙表示信函由助手撰寫-提及光復議會對抗極權指他不及自己保守&quot;&gt;趙表示信函由助手撰寫 提及「光復議會」、「對抗極權」指他不及自己保守&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡亦引信函提及「一同推動『團結一致，立會過半，光復議會』」。趙回應時提及早前民動帖文出現「光復議會」，他亦曾向法官致歉指沒有做好謹慎責任，並指就此信函會刪除「光復議會」及「創出民主運動的壯舉」字句。趙同意陳仲衡所指，當時已經是10月30日，他在遣詞用字上會較小心，但指因要處理其他工作，故最後沒有跟進信件修改事宜，亦沒有將感謝函發出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉其後問趙有沒有其他想更改的字眼，趙指會刪除「立法會選舉雖被政權無理延遲一年，國安法已臨」、「對抗極權，支援運動」以及「團結民主力量，對抗專制極權」。法官李運騰問，撰寫信函的黎敬輝是否支持本土抗爭派的立場？趙稱在民主派光譜中，「佢睇得比我冇咁保守」。被問草擬本是否由黎自行撰寫，趙指他指示黎草擬，「佢自己草擬定係搵咗兼職草擬再比我，我就唔知道啦」，他亦不清楚黎現時身在何處。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官質疑民動工作報告無提被騎劫並感謝戴耀廷-趙稱互送高帽壓抑真實感受&quot;&gt;官質疑民動工作報告無提被騎劫並感謝戴耀廷 趙稱「互送高帽」、壓抑真實感受&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡最後要求展示民主動力2018年11月至2020年12月的工作報告，提及2020年7月12日初選投票結束，戴耀廷、區諾軒和趙家賢於香港民意研究所外舉行記者會，「召集人趙家賢博士感謝超過60萬香港市民面對當權者有形無形的打壓，仍無懼走出來表達意見。同時，非常感謝民主動力秘書處團隊、兩位初選協調人、香港民意研究所、各區議員、黃店、站務人員及義工共同努力，排除萬難，成就香港民主歷史一頁。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡指，這份報告非如感謝函般未經發布，而當中提及初選「成就香港民主歷史一頁」，問趙是否同意？趙指當時其助手應將他在記者會的發言綜合在報告。沈士文再問，「35+」是否香港民主歷史一頁？趙指民間投票有逾50萬人投票，是香港民主歷史的一頁，但亦指他當日仍未看到戴耀廷〈真攬炒十步〉一文。惟李運騰指，至報告撰寫的2020年12月，趙已曾讀過戴的文章，並問「報告哪裡提到被騎劫？你的組織被騎劫，這不是重要的事嗎？而你沒有向執委會報告？」，鄒家成和林卓廷微笑。趙指，工作報告是按時間撰寫，職員只是按當時紀錄整理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，故趙的助手沒有感覺他被騎劫？趙否認，解釋工作報告大部分都是態度正面。陳慶偉續問，第一段提及「非常感謝…兩位初選協調人」，並笑着說，「你一直指責戴耀廷作為『大文豪』、『大思想家』，而你又多謝他（“All along you condemned benny tai as a great writer, as great philosopher, and you thanked him.”）」，林卓廷、鄒家成和吳政亨發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續回應：「喺當時嘅情況下，大家有咁多人出嚟投票，整個社會氣氛係雄心壯志嘅」，陳慶偉指他不關注市民，而是問戴耀廷。趙續重申，當晚見到有很多人投票，「各個記者都問啲好正向嘅訊息，咁與會嘅發言者都會向大家互送高帽」，林卓廷和鄒家成再發笑。李運騰問，故因此避免冒犯投票者，趙家賢就隱瞞（conceal）了他對戴的真實感受？趙答：「唔係隱瞞，係壓抑」，被告和旁聽席即傳來大笑聲，在延伸庭的黃之鋒亦笑到抬起頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙其後同意，戴耀廷有關攬炒的文章「絕對唔係」以「35+」的名義發布，而民主動力發布的初選廣告，亦只是籲選民投票，同意不理否決財案，初選有逾50萬人投票本身已是「公民社會嘅歷史一頁」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/asQN61X.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（14日）踏入審訊第43天。趙家賢續接受盤問，同意運用否決權與否非戴耀廷一人能決定，需所有人同意。法官關注會上如何處理各方分歧，趙指新東和新西曾在戴要求下進行「意向性投票」。法官追問意思，李運騰一度指即少數服從多數，「這就是民主，對嗎？」；陳慶偉則問趙若是戴會怎樣做，趙答「我好難代入我係戴耀廷，精神同心理上都好難」，惹來哄堂大笑，趙並指戴是想獲得起草協議的大方向。趙又重申，對民主黨代表未獲授權，但新東通過「會運用」否決權感詫異，沒有出席該次會議的他在法官追問下，指當時民主黨代表「應該係」沒有投票。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙確認各區協調會議達成4項共識&quot;&gt;趙確認各區協調會議達成4項共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表林卓廷和黃碧雲的大狀沈士文繼續盤問。趙家賢確認在初選投票日前，參選人唯一需要簽署的只是提名表格，而協調會議上，所有參選人需就4點達成共識，包括進行公民投票、替補機制、出選議席數目、舉辦初選論壇，若不同意就不能參與初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙同意，有選區會在初選後才商討出選名單，指以其記憶包括九東、港島區及超級區議會，惟提及九東時於該區出選的施德來搖頭。趙亦同意，5個地方選區及超級區議會，均對上述4點達成共識，他沒有收到任何參與者有異議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙同意用否決權與否非戴耀廷個人可決定-指新東新西曾進行意向性投票&quot;&gt;趙同意用否決權與否非戴耀廷個人可決定 指新東新西曾進行「意向性投票」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈續問及，參選人當選後是否運用權力否決財政預算案，是一項非常重要的議題，並不能只由戴耀廷決定？趙同意該承諾需由所有參與者同意，但強調戴在會上有提及否決預算案的觀點。法官李運騰續問，若會議上各人對運用否決權有不同意見，該如何解決，是投票決定、少數服從多數，還是需達成一致共識？趙表示他及民主動力並非協調的角色，但根據其助手黎敬輝所指，新西及新東最後在戴的要求下進行「意向性投票」。李追問，這即是少數服從多數，「這就是民主，對嗎？」林卓廷一度說「嘩」，趙未有回答。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官要求解釋意向性投票趙我好難代入戴耀廷精神同心理上都好難&quot;&gt;官要求解釋「意向性投票」趙：我好難代入戴耀廷，精神同心理上都好難&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉其後問甚麼是「意向性投票」，並舉例在新東會議，可能社民連對否決權有保留，但鄒家成說一定要運用否決權，那戴耀廷如何解決？陳又模擬主持會議，稱誰同意一定要運用否決權就舉手，這時在延伸庭的岑敖暉舉起手，陳又模擬誰反對、中立或不獲授權的也舉手，問是否就是「意向性投票」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙回應，初選要制訂大家都有一致共識的條款，但若協調時作正式投票，就未能處理對議題不贊成或有保留人士的關注，故「意向性投票」可指「非正式投票」，並指戴曾提及想獲得與會者大方向以起草協議。陳慶偉再問，假若趙是戴耀廷，會如何處理議會上不同意見？趙重申若工作上要擬訂協議，「都要有個多數人同意嘅版本出嚟再畀各個個人或組織去研究。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉認為說法抽象，再問若趙是戴耀廷會怎樣做（“What would you do if you are Benny Tai?”），會如何處理會上分歧？趙回答：「法官閣下，首先我好難代入我係戴耀廷，我精神同心理上都好難」，惹來哄堂大笑，趙並指：「但係如果我係以一個有調解員背景嘅協調人⋯」惟遭陳慶偉打斷，並指趙其實對會上投票情況不知情，趙指「因為唔係我倡議要做嗰個投票嘅」，並同意自己只是被告知曾進行投票，亦無再仔細追問之後有否其他溝通程序，導致最終投票結果出現在協議文件中。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱民主黨代表未獲授權-當時應該係沒有投票&quot;&gt;趙稱民主黨代表未獲授權 當時「應該係」沒有投票&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文續引述趙早前的證供，趙稱對新東第二次會議投票通過「會運用」感「好詫異」，因認為民主黨代表無獲授權投票。他曾問有出席會議的黎敬輝，黎解釋戴耀廷曾指「份協議係要出最後版本㗎啦，要出到個大方向出嚟」，故進行意向性投票，結果「會運用」字眼屬大比數「so-called 通過」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，故趙理解即使民主黨代表不獲授權，但當時仍投票通過了協議？陳慶偉亦問，即會上沒有獲授權的民主黨代表，是否被要求「你行埋一邊，讓其他人投票」，邊說邊揮手比劃。沒出席該次會議的趙指「呢個應該係當時嘅情況」，被告席傳來「吓」，鄒家成發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續同意，當時曾向戴耀廷了解，得知投票情況確實如黎所說，而趙向戴反映民主黨情況，戴回應只想有大方向起草協議，之後會與民主黨處理。沈士文一度問，故這樣反映戴耀廷也認為參與者要有一致的決定？惟法官質疑這不是唯一可能，趙亦不能猜測，沈終沒有繼續發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下周一（17日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件編號：HCCC69/2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;16人不認罪受審&quot;&gt;16人不認罪受審&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表包括資深大律師潘熙、大律師沈士文、張耀良、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等，本身是大律師的劉偉聰則自辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不認罪被告包括獲准保釋的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信10人，及還柙的何桂藍、吳政亨、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及余慧明6人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;列席認罪被告包括馮達浚、朱凱廸、梁晃維、譚凱邦、岑敖暉、黃之鋒、袁嘉蔚及吳敏兒，全被安排在延伸庭就坐。&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>獨媒報導</name></author><summary type="html">趙家賢稱胡志偉為民主黨主席必撐黨政策 官引戈爾巴喬夫質疑 趙家賢稱感被戴耀廷「騎劫」 官質疑：除非你患斯德哥爾摩症候群 官問會上如何處理否決權分歧 趙家賢：我好難代入戴耀廷，精神同心理上都好難</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Space Threat Assessment 2023</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-04-14-space-threat-assessment-2023.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Space Threat Assessment 2023" /><published>2023-04-14T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2023-04-14T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/space-threat-assessment-2023</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-04-14-space-threat-assessment-2023.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some could argue that today’s strategic environment is the most complex in the history of our nation — with China, our pacing challenge, and Russia, an acute threat, both challenging the world order that has been in place and has secured peace since the end of World War II.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space is central to this complexity. Not only does space underpin all instruments of our national power, but access to and freedom to maneuver in the domain are foundational to the United States’ status as a great power. This sixth edition of the Space Threat Assessment describes a domain undergoing a significant and rapid transformation. The number of objects in space continues to soar, the value of the global space economy is at an all-time high, and, unfortunately, the threat to the domain is real and concerning today. Over the past year and a half, there has been regular testing and use of reversible non-destructive capabilities as well as a destructive test that created a debris field, jeopardizing safe operations and indicating that the domain will continue to become more contested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two significant threats face the United States with this rapid change in the domain. First, China and Russia are developing and integrating space capabilities that will afford them the same advantages the United States currently enjoy, placing U.S. forces at great risk. Second, they are developing a robust spectrum of offensive capabilities to deny the United States and its partners, including commercial space companies, access to the domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This edition of the Space Threat Assessment includes a dedicated section on the Russia-Ukraine war. Commercial space capabilities are making a significant contribution to the fight and have provided Ukraine access to space that they do not have organically. Commercial space has served as a great equalizer, allowing Ukrainian forces to have the necessary intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance and command and control to better understand Russian force disposition, communicate and stay connected globally, and strike with precision. Therefore, it is not surprising that Russia has tried to deny access to these commercial capabilities largely through jamming and cyberattacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As some have suggested, the Russia-Ukraine war is “the first commercial space war,” and it has highlighted areas where the use of commercial space capabilities has advanced ahead of policy, strategy, and concepts of operations. This assessment is important to having a better understanding of the threats faced in, to, and from the domain and should be a valuable source of information to inform policymakers to be better prepared for future conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are significant challenges, the space domain offers even more opportunities. The United States remains the world leader in space. U.S. allies, partners, and the commercial space sector provide great advantage. With strengthened leadership in the domain, the United States must continue to define safe and professional behavior in space to its advantage, seek increased transparency, strengthen our partnerships, and develop capabilities necessary to deter conflict — and if deterrence were to fail, to win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the sixth edition of Space Threat Assessment by the Aerospace Security Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). This resource for policymakers and the public leverages open-source information to assess key developments in foreign counterspace weapons. Drawing on six years of collected data and analyses, this series describes trends in the development, testing, and use of counterspace weapons and enables readers to develop a deeper understanding of threats to U.S. national security interests in space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past year was dominated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, where space capabilities, including commercial satellites, played a highly visible and compelling role in Ukraine’s resistance to the invasion. Communications and imagery satellites have been used to connect Ukrainian troops across the battlefield, track Russian military movements, and map humanitarian corridors. As space capabilities continue to demonstrate their utility, from peacetime to conflict, it should come as no surprise that adversaries seek to block their use. Thus, this year’s featured analysis provides an in-depth look at Russia’s battlefield employment of counterspace weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia, China, Iran, and others continue to pursue a wide range of space and counterspace activities, enabled by national policies, prioritized resources, and investments in supporting infrastructure. As General B. Chance Saltzman, the chief of space operations of the U.S. Space Force, noted in February 2023, “We are seeing a whole mix of weapons being produced by our strategic competitors.” Not only are these counterspace weapons in development and testing, but some have progressed to production and fielding in operational units. Such weapons could create disastrous effects for an array of national security, civil, and commercial users, especially if destructive weapons are employed that create orbital debris and render large swaths of popular orbits unusable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impacts of counterspace weapons use are no longer limited to military users alone. Harm to commercial and international space assets will also reverberate across the expanding space economy. According to the Space Foundation, 90 countries operate in space. The value of the global space economy was $469 billion in 2021, with other analyses projecting it will increase to over $1.25 trillion in annual revenue by 2030. While over 5,400 satellites are in-orbit today, more than 24,500 satellites are anticipated to be launched in the next 10 years (2022–2031), over 70 percent of which will be commercial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This iteration of the Space Threat Assessment provides a framework that describes different types of counterspace weapons and a highlight of the main countries being tracked — China, Russia, India, Iran, North Korea, and others. The country sections include an overview of military space organizations, launch and satellite capabilities, and a brief review of counterspace developments. In addition, the report identifies key counterspace events in 2022, analyzes them in more detail, and provides a more comprehensive list of all notable counterspace activities and developments over the past year (January 2022–February 2023). The conclusion includes an analysis of notable trends and expectations for the coming year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more detail on past counterspace weapons tests, including historical tests by the United States and the Soviet Union, please review the prior Space Threat Assessments (editions 2018–2022) or visit the project’s interactive &lt;a href=&quot;https://aerospace.csis.org/counterspace-timeline/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;timeline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;types-of-counterspace-weapons&quot;&gt;TYPES OF COUNTERSPACE WEAPONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space is an increasingly important enabler of economic and military power. The strategic importance of space has led some nations to build arsenals of counterspace weapons to disrupt, degrade, or destroy space systems and hold at risk the ability of others to use the space domain. However, the strategic importance of space has also spurred renewed efforts to deter or mitigate conflict and protect the domain for peaceful uses. For example, the U.S. Space Force’s capstone publication on spacepower notes that “military space forces should make every effort to promote responsible norms of behavior that perpetuate space as a safe and open environment in accordance with the Laws of Armed Conflict, the Outer Space Treaty, and international law, as well as U.S. Government and DoD policy.” Similarly, the 2022 North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO) Strategic Concept, adopted by NATO heads of state and government in June 2022, expresses the alliance’s commitment to upholding international law, promoting responsible behavior in space, and boosting the resilience of space capabilities. It further articulates that “secure use of and unfettered access to space” are key to effective deterrence and defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Counterspace weapons, particularly those that produce orbital debris, pose a serious risk to the space environment and the ability of all nations to use the space domain for prosperity and security. This chapter provides an overview of different types of counterspace weapons, drawing on previous CSIS work to taxonomize them. Counterspace weapons vary significantly in the types of effects they create, how they are deployed, their detectability, their ability to be attributed to a source, and the level of technology and resources needed for their development and fielding. This report categorizes counterpace weapons into four broad groups of capabilities: kinetic physical, non-kinetic physical, electronic, and cyber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;kinetic-physical&quot;&gt;KINETIC PHYSICAL&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kinetic physical counterspace weapons attempt to strike directly or detonate a warhead near a satellite or ground station. The three main forms of kinetic physical attack are direct-ascent anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons, co-orbital ASAT weapons, and ground station attacks. Direct-ascent ASAT weapons are launched from Earth on a suborbital trajectory to strike a satellite in orbit, while co-orbital ASAT weapons are first placed into orbit and then later maneuvered into or near their intended target in orbit. These maneuvers are commonly known as rendezvous and proximity operations (RPOs). Attacks on ground stations are targeted at the terrestrial sites responsible for the command and control of satellites or the relay of satellite mission data to users. Such a ground station attack has the benefit of affecting many satellites in a constellation (that communicate with the ground station) rather than requiring multiple weapons to target individual satellites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kinetic physical attacks tend to cause irreversible damage to the systems affected and demonstrate a strong show of force that would likely be attributable and publicly visible. A successful kinetic physical attack in space will produce orbital debris, which can indiscriminately affect other satellites in similar orbits. These types of attacks are one of the only counterspace actions that carry the potential for the direct loss of human life if targeted at crewed ground stations or at satellites in orbits where humans are present, such as the International Space Station (ISS) in low Earth orbit (LEO). To date, no country has conducted a kinetic physical attack against another country’s satellite, but four countries — the United States, Russia, China, and India — have successfully tested direct-ascent ASAT weapons against their own satellites. The Soviet Union also tested co-orbital kinetic ASAT weapons as early as the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;non-kinetic-physical&quot;&gt;NON-KINETIC PHYSICAL&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-kinetic physical counterspace weapons have physical effects on satellites or ground systems without making physical contact. Lasers can be used to temporarily dazzle or permanently blind the sensors on satellites or cause components to overheat. High-powered microwave (HPM) weapons can disrupt a satellite’s electronics or cause permanent damage to electrical circuits and processors in a satellite. A nuclear device detonated in space can create a high-radiation environment and an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) with indiscriminate effects on satellites in affected orbits. Non-kinetic attacks operate at the speed of light and, in some cases, can be less visible to third-party observers and more difficult to attribute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Satellites can be targeted with lasers and HPM weapons from ground- or ship-based sites, airborne platforms, or other satellites. A satellite lasing system requires high beam quality, adaptive optics (if being used through the atmosphere), and advanced pointing control to steer the laser beam precisely — technology that is costly and requires a high degree of sophistication. A laser can only be effective against a sensor on a satellite if it is within the field of view of the sensor, making it possible to attribute the attack to its approximate geographical origin. An HPM weapon can be used to disrupt a satellite’s electronics, corrupt data stored in memory, cause processors to restart, and, at higher power levels, cause permanent damage to electrical circuits and processors. HPM attacks can be more difficult to attribute because the attack can come from a variety of angles, including from other satellites passing by in orbit. For both laser and HPM weapons, the attacker may have limited ability to know if the attack was successful because it is not likely to produce visible indicators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of a nuclear weapon in space would have large-scale, indiscriminate effects that would be attributable and publicly visible. A nuclear detonation in space would immediately affect satellites within range of its EMP, and it would also create a high-radiation environment that would accelerate the degradation of satellite components over the long term for unshielded satellites in the affected orbital regime. The detonation of nuclear weapons in space is banned under the Partial Test Ban Treaty of 1963, which has more than 100 signatories, though this does not include China or North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;electronic&quot;&gt;ELECTRONIC&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electronic counterspace weapons target the electromagnetic spectrum through which space systems transmit and receive data. Jamming devices interfere with communications to or from satellites by generating noise in the same radio frequency (RF) band. An uplink jammer interferes with the signal going from Earth to a satellite, such as the command and control uplink. Downlink jammers target the signal from a satellite as it propagates down to users on Earth. Spoofing is a form of electronic attack where the attacker tricks a receiver into believing a fake signal, produced by the attacker, is the real signal it is trying to receive. A spoofer can be used to inject false information into a data stream or, in extremis, to issue false commands to a satellite to disrupt its operations. User terminals with omnidirectional antennas, such as many GPS receivers and satellite phones, have a wider field of view and thus are susceptible to downlink jamming and spoofing from a wider range of angles on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electronic forms of attack can be difficult to detect or distinguish from accidental interference, making attribution and awareness more difficult. Both jamming and spoofing are reversible forms of attack because communications can return to normal once the jamming signal is removed. Through a type of spoofing called “meaconing,” even encrypted military P(Y) GPS signal can be spoofed. Meaconing does not require cracking the encryption because it merely rebroadcasts a time-delayed copy of the original signal without decrypting it or altering the data. The technology needed to jam and spoof many types of satellite signals is commercially available and inexpensive, making it relatively easy to proliferate among state and non-state actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cyber&quot;&gt;CYBER&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While electronic forms of attack attempt to interfere with the transmission of RF signals, cyberattacks target the data itself and the systems that use, transmit, and control the flow of data. Cyberattacks on satellites can be used to monitor data traffic patterns, intercept data, or insert false or corrupted data or commands in a system. These attacks can target ground stations, end-user equipment, or the satellites themselves. While cyberattacks require a high degree of understanding of the systems being targeted, they do not necessarily require significant resources to conduct. The barrier to entry is relatively low, and cyberattacks can be contracted out to private groups or individuals. Even if a state or non-state actor lacks internal cyber capabilities, it may still pose a cyber threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A cyberattack on space systems can result in the loss of data or services being provided by a satellite, which could have widespread systemic effects if used against a system such as GPS. Cyberattacks could have permanent effects if, for example, an adversary seizes control of a satellite through its command and control system. An attacker could shut down all communications and permanently damage the satellite by issuing commands that cause it to expend propellant or damage its electronics and sensors. Accurate and timely attribution of a cyberattack can be difficult because attackers can use a variety of methods to conceal their identity, such as using hijacked servers, when launching an attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1 Types of Counterspace Weapons.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;china&quot;&gt;CHINA&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China continues to make progress toward its goal of becoming the world leader in space. Over the past year, China has continued to grow its space and counterspace assets, maintaining its status as the second-most-capable space nation after the United States. To enable these capabilities, China operates four spaceports and a family of Long March space launch vehicles (SLVs) that can deliver a wide range of satellites to different orbital altitudes. In 2022, China conducted 64 space launches, including two space launch failures. The successful launches resulted in over 150 satellites successfully placed into orbit and the launch of one orbital and one suborbital spaceplane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Civil, intelligence, and military space capabilities are a priority for China as it continues to invest in and plan for greater use and access to space in the coming decade. In November 2022, China completed the construction of the Tiangong space station, which is now operational. Beijing has released two white papers on space activities, in 2016 and 2021, which not only outline a vision for future space activities but also integrate space into other strategic global initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;space-organization&quot;&gt;SPACE ORGANIZATION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While China has separate organizations charged with managing its civil and military space activities, much of the technology for both civil and military space capabilities is produced by the same state-owned enterprises. The line between commercial and governmental endeavors is often blurred by Beijing’s military-civilian fusion policy, which encourages such enterprises to acquire and divert cutting-edge technologies, including space technology, to achieve both economic and military dominance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The China National Space Administration (CNSA) leads all civil space missions. The CNSA falls within the purview of the State Council’s State Administration for Science, Technology, and Industry for National Defense. China’s space program primarily contracts through the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, a stateowned enterprise with many sectors that researches and develops SLVs, spacecraft, missile systems (including intercontinental ballistic missiles), and supporting ground equipment. Finally, the China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation is another state-owned enterprise which specializes in space technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The military organization for space capabilities, the Strategic Support Force (SSF), sits alongside other information-centric domains, such as cyber, within China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA). Founded in 2015, the SSF manages space warfare, space launch, and the acquisition and operation of satellites. Within the SSF, the Space Systems Department and Network Systems Department divide responsibilities and act as co-equal semi-independent branches, with the former managing space and counterspace capabilities and the latter leading the cyber, electronic, and psychological warfare mission areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;space-launch-capabilities&quot;&gt;SPACE LAUNCH CAPABILITIES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China broke its launch record in 2022, surpassing its previous record of 55 launches set in 2021. The vast majority of these missions were launched on the Long March SLV family of rockets. The Long March-2 (variants C, D, and F), -3B, -4C, -5, -5B, -6, -7, -8, and -11 rockets provide light-, medium-, and heavy-lift capability to LEO and geostationary orbit (GEO). Some are capable of launching from a sea-based platform, but most launch from traditional groundbased launch pads. Newer Long March vehicles are being developed, including the Long March-9.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These SLVs are typically launched from one of four sites in China. The Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center, located in Inner Mongolia, was founded in 1958 and is the country’s oldest space launch facility. This is the most popular launch site and has been the site of the majority of the country’s space tests and launches, including the launch of China’s first satellite in 1970, and the first international payload launched from the country in 1992. The Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center, located in Wuzhai, Shanxi, is another popular launch site with a history of space and ballistic missile launches dating back to 1968. The Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center also has test and assembly capabilities on campus and launches vehicles too large for the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center. The other two Chinese launch sites were both built to support human, interplanetary, and lunar missions. Located in the Sichuan region, the Xichang Satellite Launch Center (Songlin) was finalized in 1984, but because of its close proximity to populated areas has now become a backup launch site to China’s most recent addition, the Wenchang Satellite Launch Center. The coastal Wenchang Satellite Launch Center, located on the island province of Hainan in the South China Sea, has hosted 16 launches since opening in 2014. Officials have announced plans to further develop Wenchang as a commercial spaceport with satellite assembly, testing, and data centers on-site. In addition to these launch sites, China is capable of launching from mobile platforms in the Yellow Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been a shift in the last decade for the Chinese commercial industry. In 2014, the Chinese government lifted a restrictive policy prohibiting the creation of commercial space launch companies and commercial launch technology, which has resulted in private and state investment into the commercial market. Today, the government may look to the commercial sector as an opportunity to replace China’s reliance on international companies or suppliers. Similar to trends in other dominant space-faring nations, many commercial companies are focusing on launch capabilities. The first commercial space launch from China is expected in the first months of 2023 from Beijing Tianbing Technology Co., Ltd., also known as Space Pioneer, which plans to launch a Tianlong-2 medium-lift vehicle from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-spaceplane-program&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China’s Spaceplane Program&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Spaceplane programs are often extremely secretive, and the Chinese program is no exception. Spaceplanes launch from traditional SLVs, spend their operational mission continuously orbiting the Earth, and re-enter the atmosphere and land like a traditional airplane. The U.S. Space Shuttle is a famous larger cousin of the spaceplanes in operation today.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In August 2022, China launched two different spaceplanes, one orbital and one suborbital, from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center. As is typical with many emerging Chinese space technologies, few details have surfaced about either vehicle.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The first test of a Chinese spaceplane was in September 2020 and was launched by a Long March 2F. That spaceplane traveled in LEO for two days, released an object capable of broadcasting transmissions, and concluded its test flight by landing in northwest China. The second test of this vehicle launched on another Long March 2F on August 4, 2022. After a successful launch and almost two months in LEO, the spaceplane raised its orbit on October 23 before releasing an object. Although it is not clear from publicly available data when exactly the spaceplane released its object, the U.S. Space Force space tracking database recognized the object on October 31, 2022. There have been few details released since, and a Google translation of reporting from state media has only indicated that the spaceplane will remain in orbit for “a period of time.” As of March 16, 2023, the orbital spaceplane is still believed to be in LEO. Available images of the Chinese spaceplane show that it bears a resemblance to the United States’ X-37B spaceplane, which completed a sixth mission in November 2022, after spending 908 days in orbit, and shows a Chinese interest in matching U.S. capabilities.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China launched its suborbital spaceplane for a second time on August 26, 2022, following an initial test in September 2019 on a Long March 2D rocket. A statement from the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation confirmed that this launch vehicle was re-used, making it the country’s first successful demonstration of a reusable space launch capability. Reporting from China indicates a large amount of funding to be allocated to a suborbital transport project capable of carrying passengers. Though the suborbital spaceplane was confirmed to have landed, reports have not confirmed the duration or altitude of its flight. China is also developing a similar launching project, called the Tengyun project, which will incorporate a horizontal takeoff and landing capability to increase the ease and speed of space launches.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;There are no indications that a spaceplane capability would act as a counterspace weapon, but because of the apparent capacity to release objects while in orbit, this could progress to a co-orbital ASAT capability.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;satellite-capabilities&quot;&gt;SATELLITE CAPABILITIES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China maintains an extensive suite of satellite capabilities, including advanced positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT); satellite communications; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); missile warning; and space situational awareness. According to a 2022 U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency report, China doubled its number of satellites in orbit between 2019 and 2021, from 250 to 499, and surpassed all but the United States in the number of space startups receiving funding, drawing 16 percent of total global investment in these ventures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notable capabilities include the Beidou constellation, made of 35 PNT satellites, which acts as China’s alternative to GPS. Satellite capabilities such as Beidou are increasingly used as tools for the Digital Silk Road and Belt and Road Initiatives. Similarly, China has released plans for a 13,000-satellite constellation in LEO for broadband communications purposes. This would be the country’s answer to SpaceX’s Starlink network and would aim to serve customers across China and underdeveloped internet markets across the globe. In 2019, China introduced the Belt and Road Space Information Corridor to build out Chinese space applications and services in other nations. Just two years later, in its 2021 space white paper, Beijing commended the successes of the corridor, highlighting expanding satellite research and development infrastructure in Egypt, Pakistan, and Nigeria as examples. Chinese commercial companies continue to develop capabilities as well; in 2021, space-mining start-up Origin Space launched a space debris cleanup prototype into LEO. The company claims this capability will be able to remove space debris, potentially with a net, though there are no reports of the satellite’s on-orbit tests or RPO activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;counterspace-assessment-overview&quot;&gt;COUNTERSPACE ASSESSMENT OVERVIEW&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As China continues to develop and deploy a robust arsenal of space and counterspace capabilities, U.S. officials continue to view the country as a significant counterspace threat. China maintains a substantial kinetic ASAT capability, most notably demonstrated by a debris-creating 2007 test, as well as numerous subsequent non-intercept tests in the years since. Co-orbital technology demonstrations prove China’s ability to rendezvous with other satellites in GEO. While these are not counterspace weapons tests, they demonstrate capability that is necessary for a co-orbital counterspace attack. Non-kinetic counterspace weapons, such as high-powered lasers or microwaves, remain largely classified or are not publicly known to have been tested. However, in a 2021 threat report, the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence indicated that China has ground-based lasers capable of blinding or damaging optical sensors on low-altitude satellites. Reporting from 2022 indicated that Chinese universities are also working on small laser devices capable of being mounted on a satellite, though this is not a current capability. China’s jamming and spoofing electronic warfare capabilities have been verified in use against space and non-space signals alike. Few Chinese cyberattacks on space systems have been recorded in the last five years, but China’s cyber capabilities in other domains form a solid foundation for potential cyber counterspace capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China also maintains significant space surveillance capabilities, which are required to effectively target and employ their counterspace weapons. The country has maintained a fleet of space-tracking ships for years, which set sail for months-long space-tracking and monitoring missions. The ships are reportedly capable of monitoring missions including Beidou satellites and the Chang’e lunar missions. In November 2022, China unveiled the SLC-18 radar, which is reportedly designed to “search, detect, and track objects such as ballistic missiles and LEO satellites.” This may be an updated design to the previous JY-26 “Skywatch” long-range air surveillance system debuted in 2014. Global space surveillance capabilities are an additional component of the country’s Belt and Road Initiative. China has had success building space surveillance infrastructure, particularly ground stations, in countries around the world, including as far away as South America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CHINA DOUBLED ITS NUMBER OF SATELLITES IN ORBIT BETWEEN 2019 AND 2021, FROM 250 TO 499.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;rendezvous-and-proximity-operations&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Rendezvous and Proximity Operations&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China has a long history of satellites capable of performing on-orbit RPOs, commonly in GEO. As reported in last year’s assessment, the Shijian 21 (SJ-21) was launched in October 2021 as an experimental space debris mitigation satellite, which separated from its upper stage apogee kick motor (AKM). SJ-21 performed RPO maneuvers around the AKM before moving to rendezvous with a defunct Beidou satellite, Compass G2. AKMs are additional power sources that help place a satellite into a specific orbit. Since GEO is a highly valued orbit, most AKMs in GEO are released in a manner such that they separate and put significant distance between the payload and the AKM, so as not to interfere with satellite operations in GEO. Previous reporting suggests that SJ-21 performed several RPOs around Compass G2 before docking and moving the defunct satellite into a GEO graveyard orbit, hundreds of kilometers above the traditional GEO belt. Updated information showcases that SJ-21 took Compass G2 significantly higher than a typical graveyard orbit, which is highly unusual for a debris removal mission.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Two additional Chinese rendezvous technology research satellites, SJ-12-01 and -02 were launched into GEO in early 2022. Soon after, the satellites engaged with a U.S. Geosynchronous Space Situational Awareness Program space surveillance satellite in a “catand-mouse game” spanning several days. Each time the U.S. satellite would approach either SJ-12 satellite, the Chinese satellites would quickly maneuver away. These activities have been corroborated by commercial company COMSPOC and highlight the RPO capabilities China has successfully developed and maintained in orbit.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China’s first successful orbital launch of 2023 was on January 6. Shijian 23 (SJ-23) launched on a Long March 7 from the Wenchang Satellite Launching Center. SJ-23 reached its GEO orbit on January 15 and one day later a second object appeared to be tracked — another suspected AKM.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russia&quot;&gt;RUSSIA&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one of the three dominant national space actors, Russia retains substantial space capabilities and forces, many dating back to the Soviet Union. However, Moscow finds itself at an inflection point. Over the past year, Russia has continued to display less advanced space and counterspace capabilities than originally anticipated. Advanced counterspace weapons that were promised, such as the Peresvet and Sokol-Eshelon ground-based lasers, are nowhere to be seen on the battlefield despite Russian claims of their success. Furthermore, reports have surfaced that the Russian space industrial base is suffering from sanctions, an aging population, corruption, and bloat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, in 2022, Russia used space capabilities and counterspace weapons more than ever before. Widespread reports of jamming throughout Eastern Europe have been attributed to Russia, as have several distinct attacks on commercial space architectures, such as Viasat and SpaceX’s Starlink system. Moreover, Moscow continues to play a “cat-and-mouse” game in orbit, using its satellites to shadow other nations’ satellites and creating confusion and concern about the intent of these actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;space-organization-1&quot;&gt;SPACE ORGANIZATION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military and civil space organizations remain mostly separate in Russia, with the Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS) leading military efforts and Roscosmos leading those on the civil side. Within the VKS, military space and counterspace capabilities fall within the Russian Space Forces, established in 2015. The Russian Space Forces’ mission includes space situational awareness, missile warning, space launch, satellite operations, and counterspace operations. Roscosmos leads on human spaceflight, the GLONASS PNT system, and international space partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;space-launch-capabilities-1&quot;&gt;SPACE LAUNCH CAPABILITIES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space launch capabilities are a cornerstone for Russia’s military and civilian space programs. Providing space launch via the Soyuz rocket — which has been in operation for over 50 years — has brought in significant revenue for Russia over the years through the sale of payload space or seats for astronauts. In fact, to maintain U.S. presence on the ISS between the 2011 decommissioning of the U.S. Space Shuttle and the 2020 launch of SpaceX’s Dragon capsule to the ISS with two U.S. astronauts, Moscow carried 71 U.S. astronauts to the station at a cost of approximately $56 million per seat. In total, these launches cost the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) approximately $4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MOSCOW FINDS ITSELF AT AN INFLECTION POINT.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;new-direction-for-roscosmos&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;New Direction for Roscosmos&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Of note, in July 2022, Dimitry Rogozin was replaced by Yuri Borisov, a former deputy defense minister, as the head of Roscosmos. This leadership change was possibly a demotion for both men: Rogozin for his erratic Twitter posts and bluster surrounding Russia’s decoupling from the ISS, and Borisov for his poor military leadership in Russia’s war on Ukraine&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/xEUTYJ0.png&quot; alt=&quot;image3&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia successfully launched 22 times in 2022. This pace is slightly behind 2021 and pre-pandemic years. Notably, Russia lost significant international launch customers after its invasion of Ukraine in early 2022. For example, just before a scheduled launch in early 2022, Roscosmos demanded that OneWeb not use any of its satellites to support military activities. After receiving no such reassurances, Roscosmos took a Soyuz launch vehicle containing 36 OneWeb satellites off the launch pad on March 4, 2022. The 36 satellites remain in storage in Russia. Due to the seizure of their satellites and the invasion of Ukraine, OneWeb canceled all future launches through Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a partial failure of Russia’s heavylaunch Angara 5 in December 2021, Russia’s lighter launch vehicle, the Angara 1.2, successfully launched twice in 2022, carrying two undisclosed military satellites into LEO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, both satellites de-orbited and burned up in the Earth’s atmosphere within two months. Angara 1.2 is expected to conduct an additional launch in late 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia maintains three main launch sites: Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, Plesetsk Cosmodrome in the northwest of the country, and the Vostochny Cosmodrome in the east. Baikonur is typically used for cosmonaut launches to the ISS, while Plesetsk is used for many military space launches, including a November 2021 direct-ascent ASAT test. President Vladimir Putin visited the Vostochny Cosmodrome in April 2022 to celebrate Cosmonautics Day, a holiday commemorating Yuri Gargarin’s successful mission as the first human in space. Putin was accompanied by Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko for bilateral meetings and a tour of the site. Once fully operational, Vostochny is expected to host 45 percent of all Russian launches, shifting significant work from Baikonur to the new domestic launch site. The 2023 Angara 1.2 launch is planned for Vostochny Cosmodrome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;satellite-capabilities-1&quot;&gt;SATELLITE CAPABILITIES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia maintains a fleet of highly capable satellites providing support to a variety of civil and military missions, including human spaceflight, deep space exploration, missile warning, communications, command and control, ISR, and weather. While many of these capabilities were developed in the 1990s or early 2000s, some are being revitalized. A national PNT system called GLONASS has been operational since 1993 and provides navigation capabilities to the Russian military and civilians, much like the United States’ own GPS. Updates to GLONASS are ongoing, and three new GLONASS satellites were launched in 2022. Several ISR and communications satellites were also launched in 2022 to complement or restore existing constellations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s Federal Space Program 2016-2025, a policy and budgetary plan for its space projects, set ambitious goals, including increased bandwidth for communications satellites, additional remote sensing satellites, upgrades to the Russian segment of the ISS, and the completion of the Vostochny Cosmodrome. However, since enacting this policy, Moscow’s space budgets have continued to shrink. Sanctions enacted after the 2014 invasion of Crimea have significantly hampered the Russian space industry. Furthermore, after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, additional sanctions were imposed on the aerospace industry by the United States and its allies, and joint projects were suspended by Russia’s international partners, such as the ExoMars rover mission with the European Space Agency. With shrinking budgets, expanding sanctions, and continued economic stagnation, Russia has focused its efforts on streamlining current space capabilities, specifically revitalizing Soviet-era programs and investing in dual-use space technologies — those with both military and civil uses. This strategy is a clear response to Russia’s burgeoning challenges in its national space enterprise. Many of these dual-use capabilities are discussed in the following section on Russian counterspace threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;counterspace-assessment-overview-1&quot;&gt;COUNTERSPACE ASSESSMENT OVERVIEW&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has a proven, well-rounded suite of counterspace weapons. Many of this year’s updates to Russia’s counterspace capabilities are found in the “Featured Analysis” section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kinetic Physical&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November 2021, Russia successfully tested a direct-ascent ASAT in LEO. The test partially destroyed a defunct Soviet-era satellite, Cosmos 1408, via a Nudol (PL-19) missile interceptor. Russia has tested the Nudol system almost yearly since 2014, but this was the first intercept on orbit that created space debris. Of the 1,783 pieces of orbital debris tracked from the test, only 661 were still in orbit as of September 2022. However, the remaining pieces are at a higher altitude, which mean the debris will remain in orbit longer, until around 2033. Some of this debris is in a similar orbit to the ISS, which had to move three times in 2022 to avoid the debris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September 2018, a modified Russian MiG31 fighter jet was photographed carrying an unidentified missile that was reportedly a “mock-up” of an air-launched ASAT weapon. Reports now suggest that this missile system is the Burevestnik. Little to no details are confirmed about the ASAT capability, but the capability is not new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Co-orbital weapons are hard to identify and track in orbit. However, unusual or threatening behavior can provide insight into capabilities and intent. Russia has a long history of unusual and threatening behavior in both LEO and GEO and conducted similar activities in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luch, Russia’s well-known GEO inspector satellite, maneuvered several times in 2022 to closely approach and loiter near three different Intelsat communications satellites. For more information on Luch and its activities during Russia’s war on Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-kinetic Physical&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible that Russia has developed a new ground-based ASAT laser system, dubbed Kalina. Part of Russia’s Krona space surveillance station located in southwest Russia near the Black Sea, Kalina may be capable of dazzling or blinding satellites. It is unclear if this system is operational or capable of counterspace attacks, but it is a notable development for experts to monitor as progress on the facilities continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electronic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Available open-source reporting indicates that GPS jamming is occurring around Moscow, and observers speculate that it is to protect the capital city from being targeted by Ukrainian drones. Russia has been installing jammers capable of denying GPS on domestic infrastructure, such as cell towers. The 2020 edition of this report highlighted how mobile GPS jamming vehicles accompany President Putin to ensure the leader’s personal safety and how GPS jamming may be used near the Kremlin. More information on how jamming has been used in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine can be found in the “Featured Analysis” section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyber&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has demonstrated significant cyber capabilities, as showcased with its February 2022 Viasat hack. For more on this attack, please see “Featured Analysis” section. Recent reports have emerged on another successful cyber intrusion against a U.S. commercial satellite communications provider. In November 2022, an analyst from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) within the U.S. Department of Homeland Security stated at a conference that the Russian hacking group Fancy Bear successfully infiltrated a satellite communications network. The intruders were supposedly in the network for months before detection. Fancy Bear is a Russian state-sponsored advanced persistent threat group tracked by the U.S. government and confirmed to be part of the Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate’s 85th Main Special Service Center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;cosmos-2558s-early-mission&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Cosmos 2558’s Early Mission&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In early August 2022, it was reported that Russian satellite Cosmos 2558 performed a close approach with USA 326, a U.S. National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) satellite, in LEO. Cosmos 2558 was likely close enough to image or collect signals intelligence from USA 326, but current reporting suggests it did not interfere with, deny, or degrade operations of the NRO satellite. With the speed at which satellites travel in LEO, the flyby of Cosmos 2558 would have happened relatively quickly and possibly within a couple of hours. General James H. Dickinson, commander of U.S. Space Command, spoke about this dangerously close approach to NBC News on August 9, 2022. A unique aspect of this mission was how early it occurred in the satellite’s lifetime. Cosmos 2558 was launched into space on August 1, 2022, and the close approach happened only three days later, on August 4. Following the approach, Cosmos 2558 adjusted its position in early September 2022 to stay within the same orbital plane as USA 326.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4 id=&quot;possible-sar-jamming&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Possible SAR Jamming&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In June and July 2021, a defense blog reported on a potential electronic warfare attack on the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-1B synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery satellite. As of March 2023, this attack remains unconfirmed, but it is suspected that Russian forces were able to affect the European SAR satellite as it imaged Russian territory near the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea. After this report, the findings were highly questioned on Twitter, leaving it unclear if the satellite itself experienced SAR jamming or radar interference in the region. However, Moscow is reported to possess SAR-jamming capability, specifically its Krasukha-2/-4 mobile electronic warfare systems, which can jam both airborne and space-based radar systems. Possibly unrelated but worth mentioning is that Sentinel-1B suffered an anomaly in December 2021 that affected the satellite’s SAR antenna power system, leaving the satellite unable to collect SAR data. The European Space Agency declared “the capability of Sentinel-1B to support the mission is therefore considered lost,” and surmised that the probable cause of failure was the soldering processed used to repair a ceramic capacitor during the assembly and manufacturing of the satellite.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4 id=&quot;featured-analysis&quot;&gt;FEATURED ANALYSIS&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;russias-war-on-ukraine&quot;&gt;RUSSIA’S WAR ON UKRAINE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most significant space-related developments in 2022 center on Russia and its war on Ukraine. This edition of the Space Threat Assessment takes an in-depth look at Russian counterspace activities in this context. There has been an unparalleled level of transparency on the battlefield in Ukraine: sensitive intelligence was declassified to reveal Moscow’s plans and intentions, imagery showed the massing of Russian forces, and social media posts conveyed the war’s horrors up close. Space capabilities are aiding in this transparency and making an impactful contribution to this fight. Communications satellites are empowering Ukrainian forces and connecting the Ukrainian people with the outside world. Imagery satellites, some able to penetrate clouds and collect pictures at night, are watching the movement of Russian forces, mapping humanitarian evacuation routes, and collecting evidence of war crimes. Other satellites can detect and locate the sources of GPS interference, which is causing Ukrainian unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to alter course. Some observers have described this war as the “first commercial space war” due to the prominence of Western space industry capabilities enabling Ukraine’s resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as with any advantage on the battlefield, adversaries quickly look for ways to erode that edge, and the same is true for space. This featured analysis details Russian employment of electronic warfare and cyberattacks against space systems, uncertainty on Russian use of laser weapons, and unusual behavior by a Russian inspector satellite in GEO. While the space lessons learned in Ukraine are still to be written, there may be insights to glean on Moscow’s space strategy and doctrine, and lessons for the United States to apply to threats in the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Eh3lvwH.png&quot; alt=&quot;image4&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s attacks against space capabilities used by Ukraine are an example of how counterspace weapons can and will likely be used prior to and during future conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;jamming-and-cyberattacks&quot;&gt;JAMMING AND CYBERATTACKS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Months before the invasion, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) was monitoring the Ukraine-Russia border using UAVs to perform overflight missions. The fleet of UAVs operated by the OSCE uses the unprotected civilian GPS signal to aid in their navigation. Throughout March and April 2021, over 60 percent of the OSCE’s UAV flights encountered GPS signal interference, including in areas near the OSCE base (approximately 25 kilometers from the contact line). These events were corroborated through RF signal sensing from a commercial space company which confirmed detection of GPS interference in the areas where OSCE UAVs were attempting to carry out the monitoring mission. The day before the invasion, on February 23, 2022, Ukrainian government sources stated that a longrange UAV experienced significant GPS interference, which caused a temporary loss of control of the aircraft. Open-source defense analysts from Janes assess that the long-range UAV was a Turkish Bayraktar (TB-2) drone operated by Ukraine and that the counter-UAV electronic warfare system was the Russian Krasukha-4. Russian employment of GPS-jamming devices has continued throughout the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond electronic warfare against GPS systems, Russia moved to deny Ukrainian command and control systems enabled by commercial communications satellites. An hour before Russian troops invaded on February 24, 2022, Russia conducted a cyberattack to deny connectivity between the Viasat communications KA-SAT network and its thousands of ground terminals. The attack entered through a virtual private network and deployed wiper malware that crashed terrestrial modems via the satellite downlink. One of Viasat’s customers was the target: the Ukrainian government and military. However, the attack indiscriminately affected other Viasat users in Europe, including disabling about one-fifth of wind turbines and internet users across Central Europe. In light of the attack against Viasat, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation and CISA released a joint statement to commercial satellite communications providers urging companies to reinforce the cybersecurity and resilience of their networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the successful cyberattack on Viasat, the Ukrainian government sought help from Elon Musk and SpaceX to help the country restore connectivity through commercial LEO broadband. Only four days after the initial invasion, thousands of Starlink terminals were successfully delivered to Ukraine and reconnected the Ukrainian government and civilians to the internet. Russia attempted to jam SpaceX’s Starlink ground terminals to break Ukrainian communications once again. However, SpaceX was able to quickly counter the attack, and services have not been seriously disrupted since this first attempt in March 2022. According to U.S. Department of Defense leadership, Starlink was able to combat jamming by fixing lines of code, making the Russian attack ineffective. Starlink continues to face attempted jamming by Russian systems, but “their success has been limited.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional jamming has been observed throughout the conflict and in various locations. In March 2022, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) released the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the current context of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the issue of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) jamming and/or possible spoofing has intensified in geographical areas surrounding the conflict zone and other areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Eurocontrol, Network of Analysts and open-source data reports analyzed by EASA indicate that since February 24, 2022, there are four key geographical areas where GNSS interference (spoofing or jamming) has intensified, namely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kaliningrad region, surrounding Baltic sea and neighboring States;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eastern Finland;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Black Sea; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Eastern Mediterranean area near Cyprus, Turkey, Lebanon, Syria and Israel, as well as Northern Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These locations have all experienced significant interference with PNT systems such as GPS and Galileo. Data from commercial RF data analytics company, Spire Global, corroborated GNSS interference over the Eastern Mediterranean in the February 2022 time frame, as shown on page 18. Additionally, reports of GPS jamming emerged just after Finnish president Sauli Niinistö met with U.S. president Joe Biden in Washington, D.C. Finnair also reported several occurrences of GPS jamming when its commercial airliners flew near Kaliningrad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several reports of ground-based electronic warfare devices being used in Ukraine, possibly including the Krasukha-4, RB-109A “Bylina,” R-330ZH Zhitel, Borisoglebsk-2, and Tirada-2, which all have the capability to deny or disrupt GPS or satellite communications through uplink and downlink jamming. Many of these come from reported captures of Russian vehicles and systems during the war — often from videos or images posted on social media. However, there is little concrete confirmation on which of these jamming devices have been used. While it is unclear which systems are deployed by Russia, it is clear that jamming has been widespread and frequent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lasing-and-dazzling&quot;&gt;LASING AND DAZZLING&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of ISR satellites to enable Ukraine’s tactical operations has been astounding. Given the advantage commercial ISR satellites has provided to Ukraine, it is surprising that Russia has failed to employ more counterspace weapons to erode this advantage. In May 2022, Russian deputy prime minister Yuri Borisov claimed that the country had successfully destroyed a Ukrainian UAV using its Zadira laser weapon. According to Borisov, the Zadira weapon is more powerful and damaging than its predecessor, the Peresvet. Borisov stated in a TV interview that “if Peresvet blinds an object, the new generation of laser weapons physically destroys the target. It is burned up.” Officials from both the United States and Ukraine commented that these reports have not been substantiated, and there is little evidence to prove that the attack occurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite much boasting of capability, there are no independently verified reports of Russia deploying directed-energy capabilities against satellites in its war on Ukraine. Russian officials have showcased the Peresvet in recent years, a ground-based satellite laser. In 2021, President Putin announced that this laser would be adapted for an airborne platform. Another touted capability is the Sokol-Eshelon, an airborne laser system that is a revival of a Soviet-era program, which has the stated capability to attack satellites in LEO. Neither of these capabilities have been employed in the Ukrainian conflict despite the high volume of remote sensing satellites and other platforms that are providing data and intelligence on Russian troop positions to the Ukrainian military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On October 26, 2022, at the United Nations General Assembly, Konstantin Vorontsov, the deputy director of the Russian foreign ministry’s department of nonproliferation and arms, warned that “quasi-civilian infrastructure may become a legitimate target for retaliation.” This indicates that Moscow considers commercial companies providing services to governments and militaries as legitimate targets in times of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;co-orbital-rendezvous-and-proximity-operations&quot;&gt;CO-ORBITAL RENDEZVOUS AND PROXIMITY OPERATIONS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the Russian inspector satellite Luch may also be supporting Russia’s war on Ukraine through signals intelligence gathering in GEO. At the beginning of 2020, Luch made a significant maneuver westward, covering about 60 degrees in longitude. As it moved, Luch had the opportunity to conduct multiple close approaches with other satellites. However, a year later, in March 2021 — just months after Russia began its initial military buildup near the Ukrainian border — Luch made a significant maneuver back eastward to visit another Russian satellite in GEO, Cosmos 2520, and an Azerbaijani satellite, Azerspace-2/Intelsat 38. Luch then maneuvered and loitered near Intelsat 33e from October 2021 through January 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As corroborated by data and analysis from commercial space domain awareness company Slingshot Aerospace, Luch moved to rendezvous with Intelsat 39, a high-throughput communications satellite with European coverage, one month before Russia invaded Ukraine. Since the war began, Luch has been performing proximity operations near Intelsat satellites and loitering nearby for about 150 days at each satellite — a significant departure from Luch’s nominal operations since typical loiter times are much less. Notably, these Intelsat satellites are transmitting Ku- and C-band frequencies (which are often used for secure military communications) over Ukraine, although it is unclear if they are supporting any military operations in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;india&quot;&gt;INDIA&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India catapulted onto the global counterspace stage in 2019 when it launched its first (and only) ASAT test, becoming only the fourth country to successfully demonstrate a direct-ascent ASAT capability. The Indian space sector continued to grow throughout 2022, with a particular focus on military and private satellite imagery. In October 2022, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a new Mission Defense Space Program, where New Delhi highlighted 75 defense space mission areas for private companies to focus on. These 75 missions were separated into five broad categories of space technology for both civilian and military operations: satellite, launch, software, ground systems, and communications and payload.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;space-organization-2&quot;&gt;SPACE ORGANIZATION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India’s space program has historically focused on civil and scientific missions, though the past five years have seen expanded military activity. The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) is the civilian branch of India’s national space program and has evolved into the sixth-largest space agency in the world. The ISRO operates under the Department of Space, which is headed by the prime minister. Founded in April 2019, the Defence Space Agency (DSA) is charged with upholding India’s national security concerns in space and operates under the Ministry of Defence. The DSA — a collaborative effort between India’s air force, army, and navy — is led by an air force vice marshal and is responsible for the country’s direct-ascent ASAT capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its subsidiary, the Defence Space Research Organisation (DSRO), also established in 2019, absorbed the country’s previous military space agencies, including the Defence Satellite Control Centre and the Defence Imagery Processing and Analysis Centre. The DSRO is led by a senior defense scientist and is responsible for the development of “space warfare systems and associated technology.” There is little documentation on either organization to further describe mandates, goals, or direction. India’s Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) was founded in 1958 as the primary research and development wing of the Ministry of Defence. The DRDO leads the development of electronic warfare systems, missiles, and radars, among other systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;space-launch-capabilities-2&quot;&gt;SPACE LAUNCH CAPABILITIES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India has three major launch sites in the country: the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, the oldest ISRO launch facility in India, which houses the design and development of SLVs; the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, the most popular ISRO launch site due to its geographic superiority; and the Abdul Kalam Island site, which is operated by the DRDO and hosts the Integrated Test Range missile testing facility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India currently has four active SLVs that are capable of successfully delivering spacecraft to orbit, with at least one new launch vehicle in the testing stage of development. The Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) has been India’s most successful and versatile vehicle, capable of successfully delivering a variety of payloads to orbit. The Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) focuses on delivering communication satellites to GEO. The Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark-III (LVM3) is a next-generation versatile vehicle, which can launch communication satellites twice the size of its GSLV predecessor as well as deliver payloads of up to 10 tons to LEO. The ISRO’s first launch in 2023 debuted the agency’s new Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV-D2), launched from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre. It placed an ISRO Earth observation satellite into orbit along with two private sector satellites — one commercial and one academic. This SSLV-D2 was developed to offer a more available and affordable launch service to the private sector, focusing on small satellite launches. Two other launch vehicles are in development, the Human Rated Launch Vehicle (HRLV), a follow-on to the LVM3, and the Reusable Launch Vehicle-Technology Demonstrator (RLV-TD). In total, the ISRO has launched 381 foreign satellites from 1999 to 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The country had four successful launches and one failure in 2022: three PSLV launches that placed 15 satellites into orbit, one GSLV launch that delivered 36 OneWeb satellites into orbit, and one failure of the SSLV launcher. With support from the ISRO, Indian start-up Skyroot Aerospace successfully tested the country’s first private industry launch vehicle, the Vikram-S, in November 2022 in hopes of an operational launch sometime in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;INDIA’S SPACE PROGRAM HAS HISTORICALLY FOCUSED ON CIVIL AND SCIENTIFIC MISSIONS, THOUGH THE PAST FIVE YEARS HAVE SEEN EXPANDED MILITARY ACTIVITY.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;satellite-capabilities-2&quot;&gt;SATELLITE CAPABILITIES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India has over 60 satellites on orbit, the majority of which serve civilian or research purposes, and boasts “the largest civilian remote sensing satellite constellation.” Additionally, India has successfully launched two missions to the Moon. Chandrayaan-1 was an orbiter launched in 2008 with a mission life of two years. A decade later, Chandrayaan-2 was launched, a complex mission that consisted of an orbiter, lander, and rover to further explore the south pole of the Moon. The orbiter was able to maneuver to successfully reach its intended orbit and has an estimated mission life of seven years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The country has a small number of satellites that have been used for military purposes. A large portion of the country’s Geosynchronous Satellite (GSAT) communications constellation is used for military communications. GSAT-7 was the first ISRO satellite to provide services to the Indian military, largely to the Indian navy to enable communications between air, land, submarine, and warship systems. Similarly, GSAT-7A provides communication services to the Indian air force and army. The country’s first electronic intelligence satellite, EMISAT, is in orbit and is operated by the DRDO. India’s first all-weather radar-imaging satellite, Risat-2, successfully monitored border and maritime activity for the government and re-entered Earth’s atmosphere in 2022 after a 13-year mission. One of India’s most notable satellites, Microsat-R, was operated by the DRDO as an imaging satellite and used as a target for the 2019 destructive ASAT test. Additional reports indicate that India has been investing in the development of military intelligence satellites, specifically focusing on the contested China-India border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;counterspace-assessment-overview-2&quot;&gt;COUNTERSPACE ASSESSMENT OVERVIEW&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India’s rise in the space domain is largely due to its demonstrated kinetic direct-ascent ASAT capability launched in 2019. Soon after the test, DRDO officials did not announce specific plans for another ASAT test in LEO but did indicate a possibility of testing in a higher orbit. The possibility of another ASAT test can be seen in research debates across the country. Despite continuing to invest in government and private industry capabilities, there were few public reports of counterspace developments in 2022. The DRDO has sectors focused on the development and design of “electronic, electro-optical and laser based sensors and systems,” though there are no public reports that non-kinetic counterspace capabilities have been developed. It does not appear that India targets space systems in its electronic or cyber systems. India continues to place an emphasis on encouraging developments in the commercial sector to increase its share of the global space economy, boost its domestic technology and industrial sectors, and increase its international standing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iran&quot;&gt;IRAN&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2008, Iran became the ninth country to successfully place a satellite into orbit using indigenous technologies. Since then, Iran’s space program has become one of the largest in the Middle East, and the country’s leaders regularly invoke the program as a symbol of national strength and progress. However, other countries insist that Iran’s civil and military space programs are cover for Tehran to circumvent international sanctions and develop an offensive ballistic missile and nuclear program. Iran publicly denies any interest in pursuing a nuclear ballistic missile program, claiming its right to pursue a peaceful space program under state sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;space-organization-3&quot;&gt;SPACE ORGANIZATION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran’s space sector primarily falls under two primary organizations, the civilian Iranian Space Agency (ISA), founded in 2003, and the military Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Aerospace Force. While the two are technically separate, they share significant overlap in terms of authority and agenda. The ISA falls under the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology and operates with a Supreme Space Council, which sets policy and is chaired by the Iranian president. The Ministry of Defense is also involved in ISA operations, as its subsidiary groups develop the majority of SLV components and build the satellites. The IRGC is not subject to the policy of the Supreme Space Council and has traditionally focused on developing solid-fuel rockets — not typically used for modern SLVs but well suited for missiles — which has only increased suspicions about the intent of the IRGC’s space program. Due to international sanctions against supplying ballistic missile technology to the Iranian government, Iran’s private sector has been used as a front to circumvent sanctions and acquire space launch technology. These companies, like the Iranian government, often lack transparency and accountability, and many could likely be considered state-owned enterprises rather than independent businesses contracted by the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The early months of 2023 have also seen an uptick of discussion about space in Tehran, with the announcement of a 10-year strategic plan for space released by the ISA in collaboration with the Secretariat of the Supreme Space Council. This document outlines a future where Iran is a regional leader in space technologies and space launch services by 2033. The plan has been applauded by the Iranian president, who added a goal for Iranian-built satellites to orbit in GEO and for independent broadcasting capabilities to be secured. This continues previously stated goals for the burgeoning space program, which included routinely launching satellites into LEO, attaining access to GEO by 2026, and sending an Iranian astronaut to space aboard an Iranian SLV by 2032.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;space-launch-capabilities-3&quot;&gt;SPACE LAUNCH CAPABILITIES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, Iran launched two satellites into orbit and had multiple successful tests of new SLVs. This brings the total of Iranian SLVs to five, to include the Safir, Simorgh, Qased, Zuljanah, and Ghaem. Of the five, three are operated by the ISA and two by the IRGC. The ISA operates the Safir, Simorgh, and Zuljanah. On February 9, 2009, the Safir became Iran’s first SLV to place objects into LEO, featuring a launch range of 300 to 350 kilometers. This success was followed by the Simorgh, with an extended launch range of up to 500 kilometers. After several failed attempts, the Simorgh was successful at placing objects in orbit in 2021. Among other similarities, both SLVs use liquid-fueled engines from the Shahab-3 medium-range ballistic missile. The Zuljanah, which has a hybrid design incorporating solid- and liquid-fuel stages and aims to deliver payloads of 220 kilogram to a 500 km orbit, was successfully tested for a second time in the summer of 2022. However, Iranian SLV progress also saw setbacks, such as the reported explosion of an unspecified SLV on a launchpad in March 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Qased rocket was the first SLV operated solely by the IRGC and had a successful maiden flight in 2020 to launch Iran’s first military satellite, Noor-1. It was subsequently used to launch the Noor-2 in March 2022. In November 2022, the IRGC also tested a new three-stage solid-fuel launch vehicle, the Ghaem 100, which is designed to reach orbits of 500 kilometers and borrows heavily from the Qased. The Ghaem 100 vehicle is contracted to launch Nahid communication satellites into LEO, potentially in the first six months of 2023. Iran’s SLV and ballistic missile technology is heavily influenced by or acquired from other nations, particularly Russia and North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, in October 2022, a third-stage capability, called Saman-1, was tested, which would allow a satellite to change orbits more quickly. This was tested by the Space Research Center and launched by Iran’s defense ministry, with additional interest from the ISA, which indicates that the technology is likely to be used by both the IRGC and the ISA when fully developed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran operates two primary launch sites: the Shahrud Missile Test Site and the Imam Khomeini Space Center. The Shahrud Missile Test Site is located over 400 kilometers east of Tehran and is the predominant launch site of the ISA. The site was built in the 1980s with both Chinese and North Korean assistance. Construction of the Imam Khomeini Space Center, 50 kilometers southeast of Semnan, was completed in 2008 and inaugurated with the launch of a Shahab rocket. Following a destructive rocket launch failure in 2012 and significant construction, the center reopened its doors on July 27, 2017, with the successful launch of a Simorgh SLV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Iran continues to launch satellites from the Russian-leased Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. In August 2022, a Russian rocket launched a remote-sensing Khayyam satellite, which, according to Iran’s information and communications technology minister, Issa Zarepour, was the beginning “of a strategic cooperation between Iran and Russia in the space industry.” The ISA claims that the satellite will send encrypted data to Iranian operators and that Russia will not have access to its data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;satellite-capabilities-3&quot;&gt;SATELLITE CAPABILITIES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran currently has three satellites in orbit: the country’s first military satellite, Noor, launched in 2020; Noor-2, a military reconnaissance satellite launched into LEO in March 2022; and the Khayyam Earth-imaging satellite, built and launched by Russia in August 2022. Both Noor satellites collect ISR data, and Iranian officials have released color photographs that the Noor-2 satellite took of U.S. military bases in Bahrain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2023, the ISA head announced a new telecommunication satellite system, named after former IRGC commander Qassem Soleimani, which is cited as a fundamental element of the 10-year plan for space. Additionally, an Iranian state-run news agency has reported that Iran is capable of building indigenous remote-sensing satellites able to capture images with a resolution of 5 to 10 meters. This capability has not been verified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran is developing other space capabilities as well and is strengthening relationships with other space-faring nations, particularly Russia. The Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 solidified a military alliance between Iran and Russia, and there are reports that Iran is now Russia’s top military supplier. In exchange for Iran’s support, particularly through the supply of UAVs, Russia is likely returning the favor with military and technical support to Iran. Further, in December 2022, the ISA and Roscosmos signed an agreement to design and build remote sensing and communication satellites, develop infrastructure, and hold joint training, which may bolster Iran’s space capabilities in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;counterspace-assessment-overview-3&quot;&gt;COUNTERSPACE ASSESSMENT OVERVIEW&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a series of launch failures in recent years, Iran showed signs of progress in 2022. Though Tehran’s launch and satellite capabilities are nowhere near robust, there seems to have been a significant shift in mission success and overall government support of space capabilities. However, Iran appears far from developing kinetic ASAT weapons or non-kinetic physical counterspace weapons. The country continues to develop electronic and cyber capabilities, where Iran has shown success in jamming and hacking against foreign government and commercial satellite communications and the GPS network for years. During periods of civil unrest in the country in 2022, the Iranian government blocked access in Iran to a wide variety of cellular and internet networks, including SpaceX’s Starlink website homepage. Most notably in the last year, French satellite operator Eutelsat revealed details of signals jamming originating in Iran on two of its satellites in the fall of 2022, affecting Persian TV and radio transmissions. The operator notified relevant authorities in Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;THERE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN A SIGNIFICANT SHIFT IN MISSION SUCCESS AND OVERALL GOVERNMENT SUPPORT OF SPACE CAPABILITIES.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;north-korea&quot;&gt;NORTH KOREA&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Koreas space capabilities are shrouded in uncertainty. It has been just over a decade since the first successful launch of a North Korean satellite in December 2012, and the country’s space program has since experienced only limited progress. However, 2022 saw an uptick in space activity, including two potential technology tests of components for a future national reconnaissance satellite and upgrades to a space launch facility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;space-organization-4&quot;&gt;SPACE ORGANIZATION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s space activities are centralized under the National Aerospace Development Administration (NADA), which has the stated mission of space development for peaceful purposes, though these claims are often refuted. NADA’s acronym and the organization’s logo resemble the U.S. civil space organization, NASA. NADA was established after the 2013 meeting of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea, which adopted a law on space development. This law was revised at a 2022 meeting of the Standing Committee of the 14th Supreme People’s Assembly. State media described the revision as creating basic principles and norms “to ensure space development activities legally and more firmly (sic).” Further details have not been released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;space-launch-capabilities-4&quot;&gt;SPACE LAUNCH CAPABILITIES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, North Korea tested more missiles than any year previously. The country launched over 90 missiles in 2022, including 23 on a single day, November 2, 2022, some within 60 kilometers of the coast of South Korea. Historically, the country’s missile activity has not translated to success for its space program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea reported a space launch test on February 26, 2022, for a spy satellite, a statement the U.S. Department of Defense has refuted as a disguise for an intercontinental ballistic missile system. However, the claim remains consistent with a confirmed “test-piece satellite” launched in December 2022 at the Sohae Satellite Launching Station. Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un visited the Sohae Satellite Launching Station in March 2022 to inspect the spaceport and NADA’s upcoming projects, as well as oversee plans for significant upgrades to the launch site. In December 2022, a new horizontal engine test stand was built and used to conduct its first test, with Kim Jongun in attendance. North Korea’s second launch site, the Tonghae Satellite Launching Ground, has seen routine maintenance in the last decade but is possibly inactive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s most consistent SLV is the Unha, which has four variants and borrows engine designs from the country’s Nodong medium-range ballistic missile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;satellite-capabilities-4&quot;&gt;SATELLITE CAPABILITIES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea has successfully launched only two Earth observation satellites into orbit, the first in 2012 and another in 2016. After years of failed tests and launches, NADA completed a successful on-orbit “final-stage test” of a military reconnaissance test satellite on December 18, 2022. Ahead of North Korea’s planned first launch of an operational military reconnaissance satellite in April 2023, this technology demonstrator satellite proved camera operability, communication transmission capabilities, and the accuracy of tracking from a ground control system. The test satellite reportedly reached a 500 km orbit with a camera that captured images at 20 m resolution as well as video. Black and white images of Seoul were released by North Korea’s official newspaper, Rodong Sinmum, that were reportedly taken by the test satellite. While not an exquisite system, this rudimentary system would improve North Korea’s limited space capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ViNl2yx.png&quot; alt=&quot;image6&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;counterspace-assessment-overview-4&quot;&gt;COUNTERSPACE ASSESSMENT OVERVIEW&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea has demonstrated small successes in its space program over the past year, most notably receiving imagery from a test reconnaissance satellite, but this has been overshadowed by the immense number of missile launches conducted in 2022. While a robust missile launching capability may benefit Pyongyang’s space launch programs, North Korea has yet to exhibit the necessary sensing and altitude control capabilities for a direct-ascent ASAT weapon. It also remains unlikely that North Korea is actively pursuing any non-kinetic physical capabilities. The country has, however, demonstrated successful electronic warfare through GPS and other jamming. North Korea’s cyberattack threat is active and viable, though it is most often used for economic or political messaging rather than aimed at space assets. As the country acquires more advanced technologies, likely through illicit means, and gains operating experience, threats to space systems and ground stations may grow more credible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NORTH KOREA HAS DEMONSTRATED SMALL SUCCESSES IN ITS SPACE PROGRAM OVER THE PAST YEAR . . . BUT THIS HAS BEEN OVERSHADOWED BY THE IMMENSE NUMBER OF MISSILE LAUNCHES CONDUCTED IN 2022.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;others&quot;&gt;OTHERS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the previous chapters have been dedicated to analyzing the countries making the largest strides in counterspace capabilities, they are not the only ones thinking strategically about the changing space environment. This chapter includes discussion and developments related to counterspace capabilities by other countries and non-state actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;australia&quot;&gt;AUSTRALIA&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Defence Space Command of the Royal Australian Air Force was formally established on January 18, 2022, bringing the space elements across the Australian military services into one integrated headquarters organization (similar to the U.S. Space Force). Shortly after, the Australian government released a Defence Space Strategy to build upon the 2020 Defence Strategic Update, declaring the mission is “to prepare space power to secure Australia’s interests in peace and war.” Additionally, the Space Surveillance Telescope (SST), built by the United States and jointly operated with Australia, became operational in September 2022. The SST will provide more accurate space domain awareness by providing tracking and detection of even “faint objects in deep space.” These space domain awareness capabilities are critical to observing and clarifying many space and counterspace activities outlined in this report, including space launch, RPOs, and ASAT missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;france&quot;&gt;FRANCE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;French officials have continued to be outspoken about investing in counterspace technologies. To spur greater space advancements, Prime Minister Élisabeth Borne announced in September 2022 that the country would be injecting €9.0 billion ($9.6 billion) into the space sector in the next three years. This includes at least €1.5 billion ($1.6 billion) to the country’s civil space agency, the National Centre for Space Studies (CNES). In the same speech, Prime Minister Borne reiterated France’s military space ambitions, largely concentrated on maintaining strategic autonomy in the space domain, including the development of active defenses for space objects. In February 2022, France held its annual space wargame, AsterX, to put elements of the French space defense strategy into practice. Participants from nearly 30 countries were in attendance, spanning military and industry partners. The growth of AsterX emphasizes France’s ambitions as a leader in the military space domain and its intention to grow its defensive counterspace capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After initially publicly discussing the idea of bodyguard satellites in 2019, France is well underway to achieving this capability to protect assets in GEO with a satellite named YODA. Publicly available information states that YODA will have an ISR capability to detect incoming threats to GEO satellites. The first contract for YODA was awarded to Hemeria, a French space start-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;israel&quot;&gt;ISRAEL&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As reported in previous years, Israel continues to make progress in testing its Iron Beam capability, a directed-energy system that will complement the Iron Dome missile defense system. This electronic warfare weapon is currently being designed for UAVs and missiles, but with technological changes such as increased power and targeting, it could evolve into a counterspace capability. However, there are no current reports of Israeli leadership steering technology development for Iron Beam in that direction. In April 2022, defense contractor Rafael relayed that the project received renewed funding from the Israeli Defense Forces after successful live-fire tests. Israeli representatives indicated that the Iron Beam could be operational in as few as two to three years. This will be a permanent ground-based system capable of destroying or disabling targets several kilometers away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;japan&quot;&gt;JAPAN&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In December 2022, Japan released a new national security strategy, national defense strategy, and national defense buildup program, which all emphasize the importance of capabilities in the space domain. These documents add policy positions to an approved 2022 defense budget which dedicated ¥79 billion ($588 million) to capabilities in the space domain, excluding funds tied to ballistic missile defenses. Enhancement of space situational awareness (SSA) capabilities is high on the defense spending list, including development of an on-orbit optical telescope capability, the “procurement of SSA laser ranging equipment” to monitor objects in LEO, interoperability with domestic organizations and the U.S. military, and enhanced satellite communications systems. The 2022 budget document also outlines a reorganization of the Space Operations Squadron, to be broken up into a first squadron to focus on SSA monitoring, a second squadron to focus on the detection of jamming against Japanese satellites, and a third squadron designated as a Space System Management Squadron to manage and maintain space equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2023, Japan launched another satellite for its Intelligence Gathering Satellite (IGS) constellation. The IGS-Radar 7 launched from Japan’s Tanegashima Space Center, located on the island of Tanegashima about 40 kilometers south of Kyushu. IGS-Radar satellites are operated by the Cabinet Satellite Information Center, and data is utilized both for national security purposes and civil natural disaster monitoring. This followed a disappointing launch year for the country, in which its only orbital launch attempt in October 2022 failed to reach orbit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;south-korea&quot;&gt;SOUTH KOREA&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea’s space program reached a major milestone in June 2022 when the country had its first successful satellite launch using an indigenous liquid-fueled rocket called Nuri. Nuri launched four small satellites to be used for several missions, including Earth observation. This makes South Korea only the tenth nation to successfully build and launch a rocket. In late 2022, the country’s defense ministry tested a solid-fueled rocket as part of efforts to bolster its defense posture and to launch space-based reconnaissance satellites. Officials, including the newly elected president and science minister, have spoken about commitments to increase the country’s space capabilities, including establishing a state aerospace agency in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;united-kingdom&quot;&gt;UNITED KINGDOM&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the 2021 establishment of UK Space Command, the United Kingdom’s Ministry of Defence released a Defence Space Strategy in February 2022 focused on operationalizing the space domain. This document serves as a follow-on to the 2021 National Space Strategy and outlines an increase in investment for the UK space sector, injecting an additional £1.4 billion ($1.7 billion) into space systems. This is in addition to £5.0 billion ($6.0 billion) committed to a next-generation military satellite communications constellation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;non-state-actors&quot;&gt;NON-STATE ACTORS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On March 1, 2022, unconfirmed reports surfaced that non-state actors affiliated with Anonymous — a decentralized international activist and “hacktivist” collective — hacked their way into Roscosmos’ satellite control center. This instance was one of many “hacktivist” activities against Russia after Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Dmitry Rogozin, head of Roscosmos at the time, announced that all Roscosmos control centers were operational and that these claims were false. Another hacktivist targeted the Russian Space Research Institute website, leaving crude comments on webpages and threatening further action if Russia did not leave Ukraine. This hacktivist also claimed to be part of Anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-to-watch&quot;&gt;WHAT TO WATCH&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another year has passed where predictions from previous Space Threat Assessments have been realized. The 2022 report predicted the trend in electronic warfare that “the denial of GPS or satellite communications can have a great effect.” This year, while electronic warfare weapons were used on the battlefield in Ukraine, employed early and throughout the war by Russia, the “great effects” that may have been envisioned prior have not been realized. Notably, jamming of GPS and satellite communications did not directly trigger an escalation of the conflict. Past iterations of the report also detailed extensive Chinese counterspace developments. Despite the U.S. Department of Defense characterizing China as the “pacing threat,” Beijing was relatively quiet on the counterspace front this year. This could be for a variety of reasons, but China’s lack of visible activity should not be construed as a decrease in the threat assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2022 edition noted a growing number of countries expanding their focus on military operations in the space domain, reorganizing their national security space enterprises, and discussing how to defend space assets, including in cooperation with allies and partners. This trend continues, with examples such as Australia establishing a Defence Space Command in January 2022 and Japan and the United States affirming that attacks “to, from or within space present a clear challenge to the security of the Alliance” and “could lead to the invocation of Article V of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;china-1&quot;&gt;CHINA&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it has been a busy year tracking Russian counterspace activities, China has been relatively quiet. This is in contrast to previous years when Beijing conducted provocative, and detectable, space demonstrations such as the hypersonic fractional orbital bombardment system test and SJ-21 RPOs, as highlighted in last year’s report. What explains this decrease in activity? The authors acknowledge that, as open-source researchers, they are limited to publicly available information. However, more commercial and publicly available sources of relevant information, such as satellite telemetry data, jamming detection, satellite imagery, and translated Chinese documents, are aiding in such independent analysis. It may be that certain counterspace weapons programs have achieved their testing objectives with no need for further testing at this time; that these systems have shifted from development and test to production and fielding; or that they continue to be tested but in an undetectable manner or only detectable with classified U.S. sensors. It may also be the case that Beijing is focusing its resources on other parts of its national security space enterprise or military modernization efforts “to become the world’s leading power.” This lack of activity does not put the authors at ease, who will be closely watching Beijing actions, nor U.S. senior officials, who continue to emphasize that China remains the “most challenging threat,” followed by Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report traditionally describes weapons that pose threats to U.S. space assets. However, U.S. policymakers and military leaders are increasingly being confronted with the threat of how adversary space capabilities (e.g., ISR, communications, and PNT) can be used to target joint and coalition forces on the ground, in air, and at sea. For example, China’s fleet of ISR satellites is “more than 250 systems — a quantity second only to the United States.” Last year, Beijing appears to have launched four sets each of Yaogan-35 and Yaogan-36 “triplet satellites” (24 total satellites), which are believed to comprise a military surveillance system incorporating Earth observation, synthetic aperture radar, and electronic intelligence capabilities. Coupling its growth in space-based ISR with advancements in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and automation, Beijing is developing, across multiple modalities, an ability to rapidly detect targets and relay those target coordinates to its precision weapon systems to close its own kill chains. The authors anticipate greater public discussions, especially by U.S. national security space leaders, on the policy, capability investments, and operational concepts needed to deny others the use of space against U.S. forces and interests (i.e., U.S. counterspace weapons).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lessons-from-russias-invasion-of-ukraine&quot;&gt;LESSONS FROM RUSSIA’S INVASION OF UKRAINE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previous iterations of this report highlighted Russia’s advanced jamming, dazzling, and cyber capabilities. However, few of these more advanced non-kinetic weapons have been seen in Ukraine, despite social media videos and tweets purporting to show such systems in operation, such as the Krasukha-4 electronic warfare counterspace weapon. Nevertheless, many experts have been surprised at Russia’s lack of success with its electronic warfare systems. Also absent from the war are laser systems, such as the Peresvet and Sokol-Eshelon, and SAR jamming systems to counter ISR satellites despite the heavy and public use of imagery satellites to track Russian forces. There are several reasons why Russia has not employed such counterspace systems, to the extent such employment would be covered in open-source reporting. It may be that if any attacks were occurring, commercial space companies and Western governments may not want the success of such attacks publicly disclosed. This could be to avoid giving Russia a battle damage assessment and encouragement to use such counterspace weapons against other targets, or to avoid rattling other customers or investors and eroding any competitive advantages. Another possibility is that these Russian systems are not as effective as Western researchers predicted pre-invasion, whether because the attacks are not as damaging as assumed or that companies, as with SpaceX, have found effective work-arounds to continue operations. It is possible that these systems are inoperable or not as widely deployed as previously assumed. Finally, it could also be that these systems are held in reserve, perhaps viewed as more escalatory or to be used for more strategic purposes. Such use and non-use of different counterspace weapons in Ukraine may be instructive as analysts seek to better understand Moscow’s space strategy and doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussed throughout this report, commercial data and communications services have been integral to Ukraine’s resistance. The former chairman of the State Space Agency of Ukraine, Volodymyr Usov, stated at a December 2022 conference that almost 50 percent of intelligence supplied to Ukraine came from the commercial space industry. Starlink has been called a “lifeline” for Ukrainian forces and civilians alike. Therefore, it is not surprising that Russia targeted and attacked commercial space systems — first Viasat and then SpaceX’s Starlink. As the commercial space sector continues to show its utility in peacetime and conflict for governments and their militaries, the United States’ role in protecting commercial capabilities and strategies for how to do so will be key policy issues for the U.S. government. For starters, commercial operators will increasingly seek threat information from the government that would allow them to make informed decisions on how to better protect constellations or prepare procedures to respond to attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s resistance against Russia is nothing short of remarkable. As researchers who specifically focus on contributions from the space domain to Ukraine’s resistance, the authors ponder how space capabilities can enable David to beat Goliath. Will smaller nations invest in space capabilities to bolster their national security and resilience if attacked, especially by a more powerful nation? Ukraine’s resistance has demonstrated that space capabilities can create an advantage over a more capable military power. Should Taiwan pursue proliferated LEO communications and greater use of commercial ISR data? Conversely, the benefit that space capabilities provide in modern warfare may also provide the justification for adversaries to increase their counterspace weapons development and deny their opponents access to space during a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Starlink’s effectiveness in Ukraine has showcased the advantages of proliferated LEO (pLEO) constellations. As more commercial companies and militaries develop pLEO systems, adversaries will seek to counter them. Constellations with satellites in the hundreds and thousands may necessitate a shift in an adversary’s targeting calculus. Kinetic direct-ascent ASATs or kinetic co-orbital weapons that are designed to attack single satellites are less effective unless employed en masse. Moreover, kinetic attacks run the risk of generating a cascading debris field that would make orbits unusable, including for an adversary’s own constellations. An adversary’s options are likely to shift toward cyberattacks, debris-generating attacks to collapse an entire orbital plane, high-altitude nuclear detonations (HANDs), or attacks on physical infrastructure like ground stations. Indicators for such a shif could include research to understand the effects of HANDs on satellites, for example, as Chinese scientists are reportedly doing at a PLA research institute. Each of these variants of counterspace weapons has policy, operational, and technical trade-offs, and some would be highly escalatory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UKRAINE’S RESISTANCE HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT SPACE CAPABILITIES CAN CREATE AN ADVANTAGE OVER A MORE CAPABLE MILITARY POWER.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;space-situational-awareness&quot;&gt;SPACE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An indicator not addressed in detail in this report is the need for robust space situational awareness (SSA) to enable counterspace weapons targeting. SSA refers to the ability to identify, characterize, and track space objects, where collecting accurate and actionable data is incredibly challenging. Exquisite SSA data is not only advantageous for on-orbit operations of national and commercial satellites but also to provide accurate targeting for counterspace weapons. In order to attack a satellite on-orbit, an aggressor would need to know its precise location and where it is moving. The aggressor will also want accurate battle damage assessments. For example, if a satellite is targeted through a cyberattack that allows the attacker to disable its controls, SSA will be necessary to determine if the attack was successful by monitoring the satellite and any controlled movements. Although this report tracks counterspace weapons developments, it is important to acknowledge the critical data needed to deploy many of these counterspace weapons against targets. Countries that are investing in SSA are not necessarily also developing counterspace weapons; however, countries that are both investing in SSA capabilities and developing counterspace weapons should be watched carefully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;direct-ascent-asat-test-ban&quot;&gt;DIRECT-ASCENT ASAT TEST BAN&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On April 18, 2022, U.S. vice president Kamala Harris announced a U.S. commitment to stopping destructive direct-ascent ASAT missile testing, an important step forward for sustainability and stability in space. Since then, nine other countries have committed not to conduct destructive direct-ascent ASAT tests, including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Furthermore, a resolution in the United Nations was adopted on December 7, 2022, that “calls upon all States to commit not to conduct destructive direct-ascent anti-satellite missile tests.” This resolution was passed, with 155 countries voting in support, 9 voting against, and 9 abstaining. Notably, China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, and India did not vote in favor of the resolution. This response to the United States’ unilateral commitment may indicate greater international motivation to develop sustainable norms, behaviors, and agreements to limit the use or testing of counterspace weapons, especially those that create long-lasting orbital debris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past year offered a tangible reminder of how important and integral space capabilities have become to citizens across the globe, not only in peacetime but through crisis and conflict. In Ukraine, space capabilities offered: (1) transparency on military aggression by showing the world the buildup and movement of Russian forces; (2) connectivity by enabling Ukrainian forces to transmit information across the battlefield; and (3) a lifeline to the outside world by allowing the Ukrainian people to connect with the world and expose the horrors of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the advantages that space capabilities provide make them a target. The past year showed unusual and threatening behaviors from LEO to GEO, demonstrating that no orbital regime is out of reach of counterspace weapons. It also showed how counterspace weapons have become part of a broader tool kit and military campaign to disrupt command, control, communications, and intelligence gathering and to degrade the effectiveness of UAVs and precision munitions. As China and Russia put more counterspace weapons into operational units, such integration of counterspace weapons and tactics with broader military plans will only increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s rapid growth in its space capabilities across the PLA’s Strategic Support Force, state-owned enterprises, and burgeoning commercial sector means that it now has a lot to lose. It has quickly become the number two space power, displacing Russia, whose space program is atrophying. CSIS has previously written that “deterrence succeeds by altering the cost-benefit calculus of a potential aggressor.” Beijing’s calculus now involves a high cost, which may give it pause. Moscow’s does not. Notably, no ASAT tests occurred in the past year. Perhaps this is a result of the greater recognition of the destructive potential of debris-generating activity in space, which can ruin orbits for oneself and all others dependent on space, or perhaps it is a result of international efforts in 2022 on norms of behavior and safety and sustainability in space, or it may just be a matter of time before the technology is tested once again. In 2023, it will be important to monitor if this consequential trend is sustained.&lt;/p&gt;

It also looks at the key foreign components, restricted by the allied export control measures, needed to produce high-end Russian defense technology, such as optical systems, bearings, machine tools, engines, and microchips. The report then examines the Kremlin’s efforts to mitigate the ramifications of the international sanctions regime through methods such as import substitution and sanctions-evasion techniques.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report finds that sanctions create shortages of higher-end foreign components and force Moscow to substitute them with lower-quality alternatives. For now, Moscow’s efforts at state-backed import substitution remain largely unsuccessful. This ultimately impacts Russia’s ability to manufacture, sustain, and deliver advanced weapons and technology to the battlefield in Ukraine. Therefore, while the quality of the military equipment used by the Ukrainian army continues to improve thanks to the Western aid, the quality of Russia’s weapons continues to degrade. At the same time, the Kremlin still possesses a significant degree of adaptability to Western sanctions, taking advantage of its prewar stockpiles of older equipment, as well as countries willing to supply Moscow with restricted dual-use items and technology via a web of illicit supply chains. Considering Russia’s existing capabilities and limitations, it will likely opt for a slower-paced attritional campaign in Ukraine, putting pressure on Kyiv and its Western partners, but thereby further stressing its military and industrial base already stretched thin by sanctions and the last 12 months of the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, the United States — along with its allies and partners — introduced an unprecedented set of sanctions and export-control restrictions targeting Russia’s military industrial complex, placing Russian and Belarusian firms operating “in the defense and related materiel, aerospace, electronics, marine, or technology sectors” on the sanctioned entity list. This restricted the flow of sensitive dual-use U.S.-origin technology and software, as well as foreign technology and software made using U.S.-origin products, to the sanctioned companies. Many allied nations in Europe and East Asia, from which Russia would typically purchase such items, have issued similar directives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of these measures, Moscow has reportedly faced challenges accessing the foreign-made components necessary to produce and sustain a range of weapons systems, from missiles to tanks and aircraft. Western officials have struck an optimistic tone, with U.S. secretary of commerce Gina Raimondo remarking in April 2022, “The Russian military is struggling to find spare parts for their tanks, for their satellites, for their rocket-mounting systems,” adding that the international sanctions regime had blocked Russian access to “almost all semiconductors, night-vision goggles, avionics.” Similarly, in February 2023, U.S. deputy secretary of the treasury Wally Adeyemo declared, “Today, Russia can’t produce enough arms to meet their basic needs,” and described the Russian economy as “nothing like the Russian economy you saw before the invasion.” Yet despite these statements, multiple indicators suggest that the Kremlin has created new ways to circumvent export-control restrictions and secure much-needed foreign components to sustain and produce its weapons systems and wage war on Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report examines the practical ramifications of Western sanctions on Russia’s military industrial base to date and the Kremlin’s ability to overcome them. It does so by analyzing Russia’s defense production capabilities and limitations, including the specific military equipment and technology that Moscow may be able to replace domestically or will struggle to produce going forward, as well as defense capabilities the Kremlin is prioritizing one year into the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unprecedented sanctions and export controls are no doubt having a negative effect on Russia’s industrial complex. Moscow is under pressure to adapt, often turning to less-reliable and costlier suppliers and supply routes, lower-quality imports, or trying to reproduce Western components internally. This is likely hampering the rate and quality of Russian defense production. Nevertheless, available evidence indicates that the Kremlin will still be able to maintain its war efforts in Ukraine. Sanctions and export controls are not a silver bullet that will force Russia to bring the war to an end. Russia’s large prewar equipment stockpiles, its massive military industrial complex, and the prioritization of defense production (especially for parts and components also used in civilian industrial sectors) as part of Moscow’s wartime mobilization are likely to enable the Kremlin to continue to wage war in Ukraine, albeit with limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does not mean that sanctions and export controls are not having a battlefield impact. The quality of the Russian military in terms of advanced equipment will likely decline, at least over the near term. Russia’s ability to conduct offensive operations that require precision and coordination may be further limited, leading Moscow to rely on potential manpower advantages. Meanwhile, if Western aid continues, the equipment used by the Ukrainian army may continue to improve. Thus, the quality of military equipment used by the Ukrainian and Russian militaries are currently going in opposite directions — and as quality suffers, so will Moscow’s ability to match the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) conventionally or maintain a vibrant high-end export market for its defense systems. Sanctions and export controls are therefore having an important impact on Russia’s military, which will be felt on the battlefield and into the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expounding upon these points, this report first examines the ability of the Russian defense sector to field the core weapons and systems that make up its war machine. More specifically, it analyzes Moscow’s supply and production of tanks, missiles, uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), aircraft, and electronic warfare (EW) systems. Next, the report looks at the impact of sanctions on the Russian procurement capacity of key foreign components needed to produce high-end defense technology, from advanced tanks to EW devices. These components include optical systems, bearings, machine tools, engines, and microchips. The paper then turns to the Kremlin’s efforts to adapt to the international sanctions regime through methods such as import substitution and sanctions-evasion techniques like illicit trade via land corridors. Finally, the report presents concluding assessments of the impact of international sanctions on the Russian war effort in Ukraine, before outlining a list of recommendations to Western policymakers working to tighten the sanctions net.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russias-capacity-to-deliver-key-military-equipment-and-technology&quot;&gt;Russia’s Capacity to Deliver Key Military Equipment and Technology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the start of the 2022 invasion, Russia’s Ministry of Defense has classified all information on military equipment and technologies lost in Ukraine. Yet reliable estimates exist from Oryx, a Dutch open-source intelligence website, which lists destroyed, damaged, abandoned, and captured Russian weapons systems. Oryx only documents losses for which there is visual proof, meaning that its accounting likely represents the lower bound for equipment losses, as there are inevitably battlefield losses without any publicly available corroborating visual evidence. Based on this list, one year into the war, Moscow is no longer in possession of more than 9,700 pieces of military equipment and technology. In addition to Oryx, the Armed Forces of Ukraine (ZSU) also releases data on Russian equipment losses through daily reports, claiming that Russian losses are at least twice as high as Oryx estimates (see Table 1). While the ZSU has access to significantly more information than open-source analysis does, there may also be incentives for Kyiv to over-report battlefield successes. The CSIS research team therefore views these numbers as lower and upper bounds documenting the lost Russian weapons systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/aMLm5rj.png&quot; alt=&quot;image1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ifihqwu.png&quot; alt=&quot;image2&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1: Oryx vs. ZSU Data Showcasing Russian Equipment Losses as of March 18, 2023.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: ZSU data was acquired from the Kyiv Independent (@KyivIndependent) official Twitter account; Oryx data was acquired from the Oryx website. * These estimates will most likely be higher by the time this report is published, as Russia continues to experience daily vehicle, weapons, and manpower losses in Ukraine. ** The CSIS research team believes that the stark difference in the UAV data has to do with the chosen methodologies. The Oryx investigators count the losses of military UAVs, including the Orlan-10 and Eleron-3, while the Ukrainian side counts losses of all types of UAVs, including commercial drones and quadcopters purchased by Russia from third countries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the conflicting data, the levels of equipment losses experienced in Ukraine are clearly unprecedented for post-Soviet Russia, and much higher than the Kremlin’s total equipment losses recorded during the first (1994–1996) and second (1999–2000) Chechen wars and in the 2008 Russo-Georgian war.9 But Russia’s military capabilities still greatly outnumber those of Ukraine on most indicators, including man-, air-, land, and naval power. While an accurate count of Moscow’s current military stocks is not available publicly, it has been roughly estimated that, as of February 2023, the total number of aircraft at the Kremlin’s disposal has been 13–15 times more than Kyiv’s. Russia has nearly 7–8 times more tanks and 4 times more armored fighting vehicles, while its naval fleet is 12–16 times larger than Ukraine’s. Yet many Russian stockpiled munitions are also older and of lesser quality, with many also requiring refurbishment before they are battle ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, although Russia retains a formidable arsenal numerically, it is nonetheless important to evaluate its current capacity to deliver key military equipment and technologies to the battlefield in Ukraine. This, in turn, will aid a broader analysis of Moscow’s sanctions-affected defense production capabilities. While Russia relies on a wide range of conventional munitions in Ukraine, the authors of this report have examined the following five weapons systems and technologies widely regarded as crucial to Moscow’s war effort: tanks, missiles, UAVs, aircraft, and EW technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;tanks&quot;&gt;TANKS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armor, especially main battle tanks (MBTs), remains one of the chief strengths of Russia’s defense industry. Moscow is estimated to have lost anywhere from 1,845 to 3,511 tanks one year into the war — but is thought to hold around 5,000 old tanks in reserve. Recent reports claim that Moscow has experienced particularly heavy losses of its modern T-72B3 MBT — which was delivered in 2013 as an upgraded version of the T-72B MBT. This has ultimately forced Russia to bring older tanks, manufactured several years and sometimes decades prior to the start of Russia’s military modernization program in 2011, into service as replacements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the rather rare appearance of more advanced equipment such as the T-90A and T-90M third-generation MBTs or the modernized T-80BVM MBT may suggest that they have been intentionally kept off the front lines. In 2020, reliable Russian-language military sources indicated that around 700 T-90 and T-80 MBTs and up to 2,000 mainline T-72 MBT variants were held in Russian military service. By that time, Russia was also estimated to have had 200 T-90, 3,000 T-80, and 7,000 T-72 MBTs in storage — along with thousands of older T-54/T-55/T-62 tanks. As mentioned above, many of these older tanks, including the T-54s and T-55s, have been taken out of storage and sent to the front in Ukraine to supplement earlier losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/KFhsrKv.png&quot; alt=&quot;image3&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;An abandoned Russian T-72 tank in eastern Ukraine in September 2022.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evidence also suggests that the demand on modern MBTs outstrips the current production rate. For instance, Russian liberal media has reported that UralVagonZavod, a Russian plant producing tanks, can only make 20 tanks per month. By contrast, Russia has lost at least 148 tanks each month, based on Oryx estimates. Recently, deputy head of the Russian security council Dmitry Medvedev has claimed that the Russian military industrial complex will produce 1,500 modern MBTs in 2023 — a statement that independent Russian military experts have assessed as “absolutely impossible.” Some have also suggested that, while it is unlikely that the Kremlin will manufacture 1,500 completely new MBTs, instead Moscow may largely modernize its Soviet-era tanks, equipping them with new communications systems, electronics, and other components. According to a source close to the Russian Ministry of Defense, even though the ministry plans to produce several hundred new T-90M and T-14 MBTs, it will allegedly mostly upgrade its T-80, T-72, and older T-62 tanks. Therefore, while the Russian military industrial complex may struggle to roll out new MBTs, its domestic defense enterprises might be adapting to the challenges brought about by sanctions by repurposing older equipment for tanks and other armored vehicles. This may enable them to resurrect around 90 older MBTs per month, by some accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, even though Russia has lost a sizable share of its prewar tank fleet — up to 40 percent, according to some estimates — it likely retains some of its post-2011 MBT stockpiles, as well as large amounts of the Cold War–era tanks and defense industrial capacity to repair and modernize this equipment. Therefore, the Kremlin will likely be able to maintain the supply of tanks to its forces in Ukraine for some time. However, in the longer term, the allied export restrictions on certain key Western spare parts used in modern tank production — discussed in detail in the following section — may significantly degrade Moscow’s defense industrial capacity to manufacture advanced MBTs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;missiles&quot;&gt;MISSILES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Missiles have played an important role in Moscow’s offensive military operations against Kyiv. While Russia has reportedly fired around 5,000 missiles and lost at least 139 missile systems within the past year (see Table 1), exact information about the Kremlin’s initial and remaining stockpiles is extremely difficult to ascertain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 1 depicts the total weekly numbers of missiles that Russia used to strike military and civilian targets in Ukraine between late August 2022 and mid-March 2023. While patterns of greater strike frequency tend to follow periods of relative inactivity, it cannot be decisively concluded solely from this data that the Kremlin currently experiences serious issues with its missile stockpiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/KZzHQMT.png&quot; alt=&quot;image4&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Average Number of Missiles Russia Launched against Ukraine, August 2022 to March 2023.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Based on data compiled by the CSIS Europe, Russia, and Eurasia team with assistance from the Conflict Intelligence Team using open-source data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major issue for Ukraine is that while its air defense capabilities have expanded and improved, giving it an ability to defend against many types of Russian missiles, it does not have an ability to intercept some of Moscow’s newer and more advanced systems, including the hypersonic Kinzhal missiles, as well as older but repurposed munitions such as the S-300 missiles. For instance, during a March 9 missile barrage, Ukraine was only able to intercept 38 of the 81 missiles that Russia had fired. Kyiv is expected to receive the Patriot missile defense systems and the SAMP/T-MAMBA air defense system from its Western partners sometime in spring 2023, which should give it a greater ability to defend against Russian missiles. However, a critical question is how long Moscow can sustain its barrage of Ukrainian targets with more advanced missile systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also raises questions both about Russia’s ability to produce new missiles and its depth of stockpiles. According to James O’Brien, head of the office of sanctions coordination at the U.S. Department of State, Russia can currently make around 60 to 90 “missiles and strategic weapons” per month. Moscow does not provide such data, but it asserts that it has sufficient reserves of long-range precision munitions and that Russian factories are also currently producing more of these weapons, claims that are backed by some Western and Ukrainian sources. For instance, evidence documented by Conflict Armament Research (CAR) suggests that the two Kh-101 latest-generation air-to-surface long-range cruise missiles deployed by the Russian Armed Forces in a November 2022 attack in Ukraine had been almost certainly produced no more than two months before their use. More recently, Ukraine’s military intelligence has reported that Russia makes around 30 Kh-101s and 20 Kalibrs a month. Moscow’s ability to make advanced cruise missiles such as the Kh-101 and Kalibr could indicate that it has found ways to acquire foreign-produced microelements by circumventing existing export regulations — or that it accrued significant stockpiles of those components in the years preceding the 2022 invasion. If the latter stands true and foreign electronics used in Russian missiles today were purchased and stockpiled before February 2022, once this supply decreases due to the war and export controls, missile production will also be affected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, some experts believe that there are already very visible signs of Moscow’s long-range precision-missile stocks decreasing, while their production rate may not be sufficient to enable Moscow to continue frequent missile strikes. In late November 2022, Ukrainian minister of defense Oleksii Reznikov stated that the Kremlin had lost around 24 percent of its ground-, sea-, and air-launched high-precision missiles. These numbers included reduced stocks of the Kalibr and Kh-101 inventories (around 37 percent and 50 percent of the initial stocks, respectively). More recent reports from the front also suggest that the Kremlin might be running out of its modern Iskander ballistic munitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These stockpile losses might have diminished Russia’s ability to sustain the current rate of fire using modern precision-guided munitions, ultimately forcing Moscow to rely on its older and less accurate, yet more generous, missile arsenal and, in certain cases, draw on its stockpiles of nuclear delivery systems to sustain conventional missile strikes. For instance, Russia has repurposed its S-300 surface-to-air defense missiles to hit ground targets in Ukraine. While, as mentioned above, the S-300s are difficult to intercept, they are also less accurate, often exploding hundreds of yards from their initial targets. Moscow has also repurposed its anti-ship missiles like the Onyx to strike surface targets, as well as the older Kh-55 missiles — initially designed to carry nuclear warheads — allegedly to exhaust Kyiv’s air defenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/FF1yrPT.png&quot; alt=&quot;image5&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;A Russian S-300 missile system presented during the Victory Day parade on May 9, 2015.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though in a March 9 air strike Russian forces fired six new hypersonic Kinzhal missiles, resulting in a much higher than usual success rate, such powerful munitions have been very rarely used in Ukraine (usually, to hit targets of high importance such as the Ukrainian energy infrastructure). Kyiv claims Moscow to have no more than 50 Kinzhals in storage, which can explain why they are deployed at much lower rates in Ukraine. There is also a limit to how many prestige weapons systems Russia can expend in Ukraine without undermining its defense posture against NATO and other militarily advanced countries. To put Russia’s missile stockpiles in perspective, a recent RAND Corporation report found that building up large stockpiles of long-range precision-strike missiles was viewed by the Russian military as vital to deterring NATO. Using publicly available targeting information from Western campaigns and Russian theoretical writings, RAND estimated that large military areas, such as airfields, would need around 30–60 cruise missiles, and critical military facilities and complex air defense structures might require 75–100. Going forward, without an assured supply chain to manufacture more, the Kremlin might have to retain a large proportion of its already decreasing long-range precision munition stockpiles, ultimately restricting the ability of the Russian Armed Forces to frequently strike Ukraine with missiles in the coming months — leaving them to rely more on long-range drone strikes, as discussed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, Russia is likely depleting its stockpile of advanced long-range precision munitions in Ukraine. However, it has demonstrated an ability to continue to manufacture new missiles, albeit at a slower pace, and has stockpiles of older and less precise systems. As Kyiv acquires additional advanced Western air defense, this may impact Russia’s willingness to expend its precious, hard-to-produce advanced missile systems in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;uncrewed-aerial-vehicles&quot;&gt;UNCREWED AERIAL VEHICLES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UAVs, including combat drones, remain one of Moscow’s pivotal combat elements against Ukraine. According to the Kremlin, at the start of the war in February 2022, Russian troops had approximately 2,000 military drones of all types at their disposal across the services and military commands. By the end of 2022, several hundred of these drones had been destroyed by Ukrainian air defense, EW countermeasures, or Russian pilot errors. Still, Russian-made UAVs — including the Orlan-10 intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and Lancet-3 loitering kamikaze drones — continue to fly in Ukraine, indicating that this pivotal aerial capability matches at least part of Moscow’s demand for ISR and combat missions against Kyiv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/X3Sl5DT.png&quot; alt=&quot;image6&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;A downed Russian drone in Kyiv in March 2022.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the start of the war, Russian officials have stressed the importance of launching a large-scale production of UAVs of various kinds. Russian defense conglomerate Rostec also confirmed in January 2023 that it is manufacturing new reconnaissance and combat drones, albeit without providing any production rate numbers. However, recent statements by Russian UAV industry representatives suggest that due to high demand, domestic defense enterprises might be struggling to provide UAV-related IT solutions, as well as necessary information security products and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To compensate for the existing domestic constraints with UAV manufacturing, the Kremlin has increased its reliance on Chinese commercial drones despite their limited range and capabilities as civilian-designed UAVs. Most of these civilian drones are produced by Chinese tech companies, including Da-Jiang Innovations Science &amp;amp; Technology Co. (DJI), and up until recently could have been purchased through the Chinese online retail service AliExpress. In an effort to restrict these drones’ use on the battlefield in Ukraine, AliExpress has temporarily restricted Russians from buying DJI drones as of March 2, 2023, and those already purchased will allegedly have their functionality limited. This may reflect a concern among China-based companies of being subject to potential secondary sanctions from the West. However, these drones can be purchased from other countries and ultimately shipped to Russia. There is also a continuous flow of DJI quadcopters to the front due to Russian volunteers’ organized procurement efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has also received — and will likely continue to receive — loitering (kamikaze) UAVs from Iran and commercial DJI-type quadcopters and multirotor UAVs via supply chains from the United Arab Emirates, Hong Kong, and Singapore as late as November and December 2022. Moscow is particularly interested in acquiring up to 6,000 Iranian drones due to their low cost and apparent ease of operation. The Shahed-136 (flying under a Russian Geran-2 name), for example, an Iranian drone frequently used by the Russian military against Ukrainian energy infrastructure and military targets, is relatively cheap with a price range of around $20,000 to $50,000 per unit. Moscow’s potential acquisition of more Iranian loitering drones — whether via a transfer or by constructing a UAV-manufacturing factory in Russia proper — may enable continuous rounds of Russian drone attacks, extracting significant costs on Ukrainian air defense and impacting both dual-use targets and the civilian population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;aircraft&quot;&gt;AIRCRAFT&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia is estimated to have lost anywhere between 78 and 305 aircraft in the war and to have kept roughly 4,000 in reserve. Moscow has largely deployed older aircraft in Ukraine, including the Su-25s, with limited success. More advanced aircraft such as the Su-34s and Su-35s, the latter considered Russia’s flagship heavy fighter, have also been spotted over the skies in Ukraine (especially the Su-34s). While Russia’s next-generation fighter aircraft, the Su-57s, due to their high cost and limited production rate, were most likely restricted from flying over Ukraine to avoid being shot down by Ukrainian air defenses. Interestingly, as the war demonstrated the relative effectiveness of less-expensive weapons systems like missiles and drones over Russian aircraft, the Kremlin reportedly traded more than 60 Su-35s to Iran in exchange for several thousand drones used to target Ukrainian civilian and dual-use infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Russia’s aviation sector is among the industries hardest hit by the allied export restrictions. Following the invasion, major U.S. and French plane manufacturers Boeing and Airbus ceased deliveries of new foreign jets and spare parts to Russia. Sanctions have impacted Moscow’s ability to sustain its older aircraft, as well as to further develop and mass produce its next-generation combat vehicles, including the Su-57s, which depend on imported advanced machine tools and engines (as discussed in the next section). As there is some overlap between parts used for military and civilian aircraft, Russia reportedly started stripping spare parts from its passenger aircraft in summer 2022, which has created additional complications, most mechanical in nature, for the already struggling domestic civilian aircraft industry. More recently, Rosaviatsia, Russia’s Federal Air Transport Agency, has approved “aircraft cannibalization,” allowing spare parts from grounded airframes to be reinstalled on in-service aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going forward, sanctions will likely make it even more difficult for Russia to manufacture next-generation combat vehicles, ultimately impacting the military reputation of the Russian Air Force and Moscow’s ability to find customers for its domestically manufactured combat aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/S7YA8hu.png&quot; alt=&quot;image7&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;In October 2022, a Su-34 crashed into a residential building in the Russian town of Yeysk, located near Ukraine. Russian authorities said a “technical malfunction” was a likely cause for the accident.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;electronic-warfare-systems&quot;&gt;ELECTRONIC WARFARE SYSTEMS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electronic warfare (EW) uses radio signals, infrared sensing, jamming, and radar to track adversaries and interfere with their communications systems. During the 2010s, Moscow made considerable advances in EW, acquiring several hundred various new and modernized EW systems designed to defend ground forces, aircraft, and surface ships from the enemy’s radar and precision-guided munitions and to conduct ISR operations. Throughout 2022, Russia has used these EW systems with relative success, reportedly eliminating up to 90 percent of the drones Kyiv possessed in February by summer 2022 and actively jamming the air-to-ground and air-to-air communications of Ukrainian pilots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the specific EW technologies used by the Russian Armed Forces, the Palantin EW system has been the most effective at jamming small Ukrainian drones. Other notable EW technologies are the Svet and Tirada EW systems — which Russia has used to determine the position of enemy forces — and the Rtut EW device that has impacted radio fuses on Ukrainian artillery shells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian EW systems also come with downsides that have restricted their ability to prevent Ukrainian military advances during the Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Kherson offensives. First, they cannot cover the entirety of the front, only parts of it, which has enabled Ukrainian military activity even at close range, as evidenced by numerous videos of Ukrainian drones dropping munitions right on top of Russian ground positions. Russia’s EW systems also work best when their operators have plenty of time to set up and coordinate different functions and hence are less effective when Russian battalions attack and retreat quickly. Due to poor planning and lack of coordination, Russian EW troops even jammed their own communications in the first days of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An additional limitation is that these systems cannot work continuously. With a restricted lifetime of around 900 to 1,000 hours, each EW system can only be turned on for three to four hours per day, meaning that at least six to eight systems are needed to cover a particular zone for 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, to produce its EW systems, Russia keeps relying on Western electronics, including components restricted by the allied export regulations such as microcontrollers, microprocessors, controller area network (CAN) transceivers, digital signal processors, and Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While not directly related to EW, another important factor worth noting is the Russian military’s flawed use of communications systems. For instance, at the beginning of the invasion, Russian forces used civilian mobile phones and Chinese portable radios for communication purposes that lacked military-grade encryption, naturally impacting their performance on the battlefield. Recent reports show that, while this issue has been acknowledged, the Russian military still, in some cases, relies on unencrypted communications, endangering operational security in Ukraine. Reportedly, Russians are also purchasing China-made counterfeit radio stations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going forward, the Armed Forces of Ukraine can exploit the downsides exhibited by Russian EW and communications systems to negate the alleged strengths of these technologies on the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-kremlins-existing-vulnerabilities&quot;&gt;The Kremlin’s Existing Vulnerabilities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous section demonstrated that high reliance on imports of sensitive technology is one of the main vulnerabilities of Russia’s defense sector. This section identifies the key dual-use components, restricted under the allied export regulations, likely to present particular challenges for Russia’s efforts to continue producing advanced MBTs, missiles, UAVs, aircraft, and EW devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;optical-systems&quot;&gt;OPTICAL SYSTEMS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Optical systems are pivotal to Russia’s modern MBT industry. Before the war, the Russian military imported a critical mass of its leading tank optical systems from France, which has now cut off Russian producers from this important component. Russia appears to be retrofitting its T-80BVM MBT with an optics configuration, the 1G42 gunner sight, which originates from an older model vehicle. Similarly, there are reports that the Russian military is retrofitting its T-72B3M tanks with the less-sophisticated 1PN96MT-02 sight, rather than the higher-end Sosna-U, which can spot enemy tanks up to two kilometers farther away. Additionally, unlike the 1PN96MT-02, the higher-grade Sosna-U system has a daytime channel, instead of just a thermal-imaging channel, and the more advanced ability to use computer sensors to help track targets. It is likely that sanctions and export controls are directly contributing to Moscow’s decision to replace higher-end optical systems with their less advanced alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s tank fleet will likely become even less sophisticated as the war continues. With recent announcements of Western tank deliveries to Ukraine, a mismatch in tank technology could prove costly for Russian efforts to shift the line of battle westward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;bearings&quot;&gt;BEARINGS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bearings are critical to producing any type of moving vehicle. Historically, Russia has imported most of its high-quality bearings from Western manufacturers. In 2020, for instance, Russia imported over $419 million worth of ball bearings, around 55 percent of which originated in Europe and North America; Germany was Russia’s largest trading partner, taking up 17 percent of its total imports that year. Following the start of the invasion, major Western producers of bearings exited Russia and ended their sales there. The U.S. government believes that Russia already faces a shortage of this key component, which impacts the production of all vehicles, from tanks to aircraft and even submarines. This shortage is also felt in the civilian industry, as Russia’s rail-dependent economy finds the production and repair of trains directly impaired. Russian domestic producers claim they can reverse the deficit in bearings via import substitution initiatives. Russia could also expand its imports of bearings from China or countries in Southeast Asia such as Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, while Moscow might be able to substitute the import of Western bearings and thus maintain the level of defense-sector production needed to continue its war effort, these bearings will most likely be of a lower quality, which could impact reliability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;machine-tools&quot;&gt;MACHINE TOOLS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Russia’s dependence on Western-produced precision machine tools is a structural supply chain weakness aggravated by increased economic isolation. Machine tools are critical in the production of numerous weapons and military vehicles, including aircraft. Even before Russia’s 2022 invasion, the country’s machine tool industry had long been in crisis. Despite efforts to diversify away from Western sources since 2014, Western-aligned firms together still provided the overwhelming majority of Russia’s imported machine tools in 2017. Estimates claim that Russia depends on imported products for up to 70–80 percent of its machine tools and construction equipment. With 85 percent of Russian machine tool demand allegedly coming from the defense industry, it is surprising that the government has allowed Western countries to continue to play such a pivotal role in the Russian supply chains of the most technically advanced tools. China, the largest total producer of these items worldwide, also remains dependent on Western imports to build the kind of medium- to high-end machine tools that Russia’s domestic defense market lacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Russia faces a critical deficiency of complex multi-coordinate precision machine tools of the most advanced categories, and it lacks the time and capability needed to find substitutes for Western suppliers. While Russian producers claim to have designed and built a high-end computer numerical control (CNC) machine tool entirely out of domestically produced components, assertions like this are difficult to trust or verify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;engines&quot;&gt;ENGINES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has struggled to access certain important aircraft engines since 2014 due to its dependence on the Ukrainian producer Motor Sich for key components in their production. By 2005, the Kremlin had already identified the need to move toward fully domestic helicopter engine production, but this goal has remained seemingly unrealized. In 2014, Russia state-aligned media announced the expansion of operations at the St. Petersburg Klimov plant — a subsidiary of the state-owned Rostec corporation — with the explicit goal of replacing the Russian military’s dependence on Motor Sich’s aircraft engines. Yet the October 2022 arrest of Motor Sich’s owner, Viacheslav Bohuslaiev, in Ukraine on charges that his firm relied on transnational networks to supply Russia with helicopter engines and components suggests that Moscow’s own efforts to increase its supply of engines through import substitution remain incomplete. Indeed, Russia’s trouble with production of high-end engines was already notable before the 2022 invasion. For example, the new Su-57 fighter jets allegedly still rely on older fourth-generation engines — specifically the Saturn AL41-F1 engines used in the previous Su-35S aircraft — while efforts to produce a more advanced engine have been repeatedly delayed, providing further evidence of Russia’s difficulties to produce the most cutting-edge fighter jet engines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s civil industries similarly suffer from the shortage of aircraft engines. For example, its Sukhoi Superjet 100 airplanes might now be relying on engines produced from the used components of 17 types of older engines. Similarly, Chinese engine producer Weichai has stopped providing engines for use in tractors produced by the Russian firm KamAZ, as the latter was placed under Western sanctions for being an alleged supplier of materiel to the Russian military. Just as with the Sukhoi Superjet 100, KamAZ is now apparently producing tractors with an outdated 820 (V8) gas engine. These examples suggest that export controls are in some cases forcing Russian producers to turn to older models to fulfill engine production targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;microchips&quot;&gt;MICROCHIPS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s domestic chip production is many years behind the industry standard in the West, making its weapons, communications, and EW systems highly reliant on Western-manufactured microchips, which are currently restricted under the allied export regulations. For instance, according to the UK-based Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), the Orlan-10 UAV contains U.S.-origin chips manufactured by Texas Instruments and Honeywell. Open-source data also confirms the presence of Western-manufactured chips inside Russia’s Lancet drone. Furthermore, an investigation by Conflict Armament Research has shown that satellite navigation units in several Russian missiles — such as the 3M14, 9M544, Kh-59, and Kh-101 — contain multiple foreign-made microcomponents manufactured between 2012 and 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s newly developed radio communications systems — including the Azart portable radio station, designed to provide jamming and secure communications at the tactical level — also appear to rely on many Western-produced components. According to data provided by the Center for Army, Conversion, and Disarmament Studies (CACDS), the Azart holds six components of foreign origin, including the Spartan-6 chip, which encrypts communications and is produced by the U.S. company Xilinx in Taiwan. As a dual-use item, the Spartan-6 is commercially available and can be purchased via AliExpress. Similarly, Russia’s reconnaissance, command, and communications complex Strelets-M relies on seven components of foreign origin, including a chip produced by the U.S.-based Microchip Technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dependence of Russia’s military industrial complex on foreign-manufactured microchips can be explained by at least two factors. First, chips and chip microprocessors produced domestically by a small number of companies — such as Baikal Electronics, STC Module, SPC Elvis, and MCST — tend to be of inferior quality to Western designs. In early 2022, the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs even complained about the difficulties of launching and operating equipment based on the domestic Elbrus-8C processors. Following the imposition of Western sanctions, these companies have been unable to officially purchase technologies from the United States and its allies participating in the sanctions regime, including the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) on which Russian chip producers greatly relied. Replacing these components with Chinese options in some cases requires a complete redesign of electronic equipment and restructuring of cooperation chains, which may take years to complete. Moreover, Chinese chips often lag behind the leading Western microchip designs. While certain chips (such as the Spartan-6, the TSOP66, and the LQFP64) found in the Russian-made Azart and 9M544 precision missile can be purchased via AliExpress, as mentioned above, dependence on such commercially available elements can make Russian weapons systems less reliable and prone to failure. For example, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo suggested that “nearly 40 percent of the less advanced microchips Russia is receiving from China are defective.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the Russian chip industry cannot meet high demand for these elements. Today, the country requires up to 30,000 plates of basic-level microchips per month, but only 8,000 plates can be made domestically. Recently, the government announced the launch of a new technology park in the country’s Ulyanovsk region as part of an effort to accelerate its chip production. Yet, under the export controls, it would be difficult to estimate the park’s production rate and quality of its products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to these restrictions, and to ensure continued access to high-quality microchips for its weapons systems, Moscow has developed a number of illegal supply chains, discussed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russias-sanctions-adaptation-strategy&quot;&gt;Russia’s Sanctions Adaptation Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia was first sanctioned by the West in 2014, following its intervention in Ukraine. In response, Moscow made it a national security priority to reduce its dependency on Western imports, including in the high-tech sector, albeit with limited success. Since the start of the 2022 invasion, the Kremlin has expanded upon the 2014 import substitution efforts, aiming at replacing imports in all aspects of its economy, including the military sector, with domestically produced materials. Yet import substitution has proved to be a daunting task for Russia’s defense industry given its reliance on foreign-produced microelements and spare parts. While Iran — already a sanctioned economy — continues to supply Russia with certain military equipment and technologies, many countries outside of the transatlantic community cannot openly aid Moscow’s war effort without risking sanctions by the West. This forces Moscow to rely on illicit supply chains to obtain restricted foreign elements. While Russia’s efforts to circumvent sanctions will have successes and will mitigate their impact, the Kremlin’s sanctions-evasion efforts also face their own limitations. Sanctions are thus likely to reduce the volume of components Russia can import, increase the costs of those imports, and lead to supply disruptions that affect industrial output. This section examines Russia’s ongoing attempts to adapt to the Western sanctions regime and mitigate its impacts on the domestic defense sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-kremlins-import-substitution-efforts&quot;&gt;THE KREMLIN’S IMPORT SUBSTITUTION EFFORTS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian government has repeatedly promised to accelerate import substitution for domestically produced equipment heavily reliant on foreign components, including armored vehicles, UAVs, and EW technologies. Yet several months before the war, Russia’s own internal assessment of the defense program introduced in 2019 found it largely unable to provide domestic replacements for Western equipment and electronics. Western intelligence corroborates this assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recent initiatives the Kremlin introduced after the invasion also tend to be viewed as too ambitious and far-fetched by local defense and military experts. For instance, to reduce Russia’s dependence on imported microchips, in mid-October 2022 the government introduced the National Project for Electronics, aimed at significantly boosting production of microprocessors and supplying around 30 percent of Russian households with Russian-made electronics by 2030. But Russian tech specialists criticized this project, with its estimated cost of up to $42 billion, for being “virtually impossible to implement” within the given timeframe. Russia is far behind the technology frontier to produce the full range of advanced microchips its defense industry requires within this timespan. Similarly, in mid-February 2023, the Kremlin announced a new national project featuring a grant program to produce necessary UAV components inside the country. However, the implementation of this project will take years, if not decades, to realize. Even Russian minister of finance Anton Siluanov recently acknowledged that “it just takes more time” to replace foreign equipment and electronics with domestically produced alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the government’s more tangible approaches includes funding existing defense enterprises to boost their production. Russian state-owned defense conglomerate Rostec is one of the chief enablers (and beneficiaries) of the Kremlin’s decision to pivot to domestic production. Rostec routinely advertises its capacity to help manufacture a range of modern weapons systems, including UAVs, tanks, aircraft, and missiles. Since the start of the war, it has promoted its ability to create high-quality technologies that can be exported abroad, among them Russian-made anti-drone (the Repellent-1, RLK-MCE, RB-504P-E, and RB-504A-E) and anti-aircraft (the Pantsir-S1, Tor-M2KM, Tor-M2E, and S-350E Vityaz) missile systems. Rostec is expected to attract a significant share of state funding, including 4.7 billion rubles (around $62.6 million) in the 2023 fiscal year. Although the United States and its allies sanctioned Rostec and its subsidiaries in June 2022, specific transactions involving certain Rostec-affiliated blocked entities, such as those that ensure the safety of civil aviation, can still be authorized. This might allow the defense conglomerate to circumvent sanctions by acquiring certain dual-use technologies through its affiliated firms involved in civil aviation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/3cZQLnK.png&quot; alt=&quot;image8&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;The Rostec headquarters in Moscow, Russia.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government has also supported private defense enterprises, including the Kronshtadt Group, a Russian defense contractor manufacturing UAVs such as the Orion drones, which have also been deployed in Ukraine. While the United States sanctioned Kronshtadt in March 2022, the company has long claimed that it can domestically produce all components for its growing list of ISR and combat UAVs. Yet anecdotal evidence suggests that the firm might have an office in Antalya, Turkey — in theory enabling Kronshtadt to import necessary components for its UAV production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, Russia’s current efforts at import substitution are fraught with challenges stemming from largely inadequate state aid programs and limited official supply chains, which are ultimately restricting the production capabilities of Russian defense enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sanctions-evading-land-corridors&quot;&gt;SANCTIONS-EVADING LAND CORRIDORS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facing obvious import substitution challenges, the Russian government swiftly established alternative routes to access restricted foreign components and technologies. This effort, which increased throughout the second half of last year, has so far proved to be somewhat successful, as imports of dual-use commodities to Russia in 2022 exceeded their prewar levels, according to multiple sources. For instance, the value of semiconductor imports rose from $1.82 billion in 2021 to $2.45 billion in 2022, based on estimates by the Free Russia Foundation. But to reach Russia shipments now have to go through numerous obscure suppliers and multiple land corridors, as detailed below, making this experience rather volatile, costly, and time-consuming for the Kremlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite facing additional Western sanctions for aiding Moscow’s war efforts, Iran has remained one of Russia’s regular suppliers of both key weapons systems, including the Shahed-136 UAVs, and restricted dual-use components. Interestingly, according to CACDS, even Iranian-origin Shahed-136 drones contain microelements produced across various Western nations, including microcontrollers and microprocessors made by the U.S.-based Texas Instruments and NXP USA Inc., respectively. Given that Iran has decades of experience circumventing Western sanctions, Tehran can likely illegally access such components for its growing UAV industry and share that experience with Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the Islamic Republic’s ways to receive Western-manufactured weapons and components is across its poorly monitored borders with Iraq. According to Middle East expert Vera Mironova, Iraq purchases multiple high-tech Western-produced components, including engines, under the pretext of an alleged war on terrorism. Those items are then sent to Iran, ultimately ending up in Russian ports, including Astrakhan, via the Caspian Sea. This geographical corridor features numerous existing and newly constructed infrastructure projects from Iran across the Caspian Sea and into Russia. Tehran and Moscow are also considering a sanctions-evading rail link, running along the coast of the Caspian Sea, that would connect India to Russia through Iran and Azerbaijan. This project, which supposedly will be completed in three years, is considered a much shorter and less time-consuming alternative to the current sea route that requires India to ship goods to Russia through Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides Iran, China is reportedly another Russian source for dual-use goods. Based on Russian customs data, Chinese state-owned defense enterprises export microchips and microchip components, engine pieces, navigation equipment, jamming technology, and jet fighter parts to the sanctioned Russian defense companies, including Rostec and its affiliates. Russian entities might have also received up to 1,000 “civilian hunting rifles,” as well as 12 shipments of drone parts and around 12 tons of body armor from Chinese firms, which were routed via Turkey and the UAE between June and December 2022. While Chinese officials say that Beijing is committed to promoting peace talks, there are growing signs that it might actually be considering supplying the Russian military with the ZT-180 prototype kamikaze drones, which bear a close resemblance to the Shahed-136 UAVs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Balkan peninsula is another popular location for intermediary companies involved in sanctions evasion. For instance, Bosnian firm Inzenjering BN, based in the Republic of Srpska, has reportedly supplied helicopter engine parts to the Russian army with the help of Ukrainian company Motor Sich since 2017. In 2018, Motor Sich delivered more than 600 shipments containing the TV3-117 helicopter engines to Inzenjering BN, which then allegedly shipped them to Russia. In October 2022, Ukrainian authorities arrested the head of Motor Sich, Viacheslav Bohuslaiev, for supplying Moscow with helicopter engines and other spare parts. Yet the company could have delivered significant shipments prior to Bohuslaiev’s detainment. More recently, an investigation by the Balkans–Ukraine Cooperation Network discovered that Moscow-based Russian military–affiliated manufacturer Aerotechnikservis (ATS), which supplies helicopters and aviation components, closely cooperates with the firm Aero Engineering Solutions (AES). AES is owned by Canada-based company Aerosupport Solutions Ltd., with offices in Sarajevo and the Republic of Srpska. In 2022, AES sent several cargoes of Western-manufactured components needed for Russian-made helicopters (including the MI-8 and MI-171) to ATS through these routes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkey has also emerged as an important intermediary involved in smuggling sanctioned goods. According to Reuters, Turkish company Azu International alone has exported more than $20 million worth of components to Russia, including U.S.-origin microchips. Another firm, CTL Diş Ticaret Limited Şirketi, established by Russian national Pavel Pertsov in March 2022, shipped navigation equipment, potentially including GPS systems with anti-jamming technology and high-precision positioning products for UAVs, from a Canadian firm to Russian enterprises supplying the domestic defense sector. Even though Turkish customs authorities have reportedly been rejecting transit declarations for sanctioned goods that had Russian and Belarusian entities listed as end users due to “pressure from the European Union” since March 2023, this will not eliminate an important transit hub, but will make it costlier for Moscow to access the restricted components via Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/RShW2mV.png&quot; alt=&quot;image9&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many post-Soviet countries across Central Asia and the South Caucasus also take considerable risks to supply Russia. For example, imports of different Western-made spare parts from Armenia, Georgia, and Kyrgyzstan have increased significantly since the start of the war. Some Western manufacturers now even ask their customers to confirm that their physical location is outside of Russia by scheduling video calls with procurement officers. Illegal supply chains also run through the member states of the Russia-led Eurasian Economic Union (EEU), which includes Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan. The EEU offers a particularly convenient land corridor for avoiding sanctions, as products imported into the EEU countries are also provided with guarantees valid for Russia. While, recently, Kazakhstan has promised to “closely monitor our mutual trade with all partners” (including Russia), in an effort to avoid secondary sanctions, time will show the effectiveness of such an effort. In addition to the EEU member states, Georgia may also be providing another route via modernized Black Sea port facilities. Reportedly, cargoes with shipping labels for Central Asia are offloaded in Georgia and then transported to Russia by various trucking companies. Lastly, Belarus is emerging as an important corridor for clandestine transfer of Chinese goods and/or equipment to Russia, such as combat drones, personal weapons, and artillery shells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although extensive, these land corridors do not provide a complete picture of the sanctions-evading supply chains developed by Moscow. In 2022, Russia imported numerous restricted high-tech components from third countries across Asia, Africa, and Europe through a multitude of shell and front companies using false end-user certificates and transshipments. While these exporters are, in many cases, operated by foreign-based Russian nationals or expatriates with limited public profiles, the local authorities of countries allegedly used as land corridors should monitor the situation more carefully to avoid the risk of secondary sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the start of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. government and its allies have initiated a commendable effort to prevent the Russian military from accessing the key components, elements, and materials outlined in this paper. U.S. intelligence has estimated that since February 2022, export controls have degraded Russia’s ability to replace more than 6,000 pieces of military equipment, forced key defense industrial facilities to halt production, and caused shortages of critical components for tanks and aircraft, among other effects. Efforts by the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) span the globe and represent some of the widest sanctions attempted against a country to date. The Kremlin is aware of this work and seeks to circumvent OFAC and its affiliated initiatives in a race that may well determine the outcome of the war in Ukraine. The Department of the Treasury and broader U.S. government recognize the magnitude of the task before them and are adjusting their actions based on real and intended outcomes. These efforts will become even more important as the war enters its second year and the Russian military shows no signs of abandoning its major goal of occupying Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the classified nature of the data in question, many of the assessments in this paper have had to rely on incomplete or circumstantial evidence. Nonetheless, this paper draws several conclusions about the impact of sanctions to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;1-sanctions-work-by-creating-shortages-of-certain-higher-end-components-and-forcing-the-russian-ministry-of-defense-to-substitute-them-with-lower-quality-alternatives&quot;&gt;1. Sanctions work by creating shortages of certain higher-end components and forcing the Russian Ministry of Defense to substitute them with lower-quality alternatives.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In particular, the sanctions have forced Russia to rely on older and less accurate missiles. However, the Russian military’s continued strikes against Ukraine are an important indicator that the Ministry of Defense can still adapt by repurposing different types of missiles. As long as the Russian forces can conduct such attacks — even if they are less frequent and less accurate — there is still a danger to the Ukrainian military and to civilian targets, not to mention the collateral damage that is an egregious and unfortunate consequence of such strikes. Russia’s ability to continue such attacks may be augmented by efforts of partner nations such as Iran or China, whose deliveries of parts and technology may not be impacted by the U.S.-led sanctions efforts. Given the Russian military’s prioritization of missile strikes on the battlefield, such tactics will likely continue, albeit with limited frequency, well into 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Second, the impact on engine production can have long-term effects on the Russian military, especially on recovery, repair, and rebuilding efforts and attempts to develop and deliver newer military systems to the front, including aircraft. The Russian government is aware of this impact, evidenced by its continuing attempts to portray domestic heavy industry and the war effort as being unaffected by sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Third, the Russian government’s efforts to acquire microchips produced by the world’s leading companies has received significant attention since the start of the war. Numerous investigations, some outlined in this report, point to the difficulty of fully and completely controlling the flow of this technology to Russia. Given their importance to Russian military systems, weapons, and technologies, the Kremlin’s efforts to acquire microchips may become even more pronounced in 2023. Reliance on imported microelectronics products that may be inferior to some of the market leaders could potentially affect the quality of Russian-manufactured weapons but will not entirely slow down or prevent the Ministry of Defense from conducting military operations. At the same time, Russia’s own domestic push to launch microchip production is a long-term effort that is unlikely to deliver immediate results for either civilian industries or the military. As the war enters its second year, the Russian government is likely to intensify its attempts to acquire microchips via existing efforts outlined in this paper, as well as through new schemes to circumvent sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Fourth, Russia is likely experiencing shortages of advanced optical systems, forcing it to retrofit its tanks with less-sophisticated systems, a mismatch that could prove costly for Russian efforts to shift the line of battle westward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Fifth, Russia likely faces a shortage of bearings, which impacts the production of all vehicles. However, Russia might be able to substitute existing shortages with Asian components of a lower quality. The full impact of such shortages is unknown given Russia’s ability to wage war well into 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;2-russia-still-possesses-a-remarkable-degree-of-adaptability-to-western-sanctions&quot;&gt;2. Russia still possesses a remarkable degree of adaptability to Western sanctions.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Russian military is crafty in its use of dual-use components. Russia is by no means the first country to turn to civilian technology to augment its military capabilities, but the size and scope of this war is forcing Moscow to work on an unprecedented scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Last year’s U.S. sanctions efforts have also revealed the difficulty of controlling the flow and acquisition of civilian and dual-use components and products that may end up in military systems, giving the Russian military some breathing space as its global acquisition efforts evolve to match the endeavors of OFAC. As this report shows, there are still plenty of ways for the Russian Ministry of Defense to get what it needs, as the Kremlin takes advantage of the global economy, complex supply chains, and partner countries willing to work with Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Major supply shortages are forcing Russia to turn to less technologically advanced items, as well as Soviet-era defense stocks. As the Russian military starts fielding older systems modernized in recent months — and as it continues to use imported military technology — the quality of such military operations is coming into question, especially compared to Ukraine’s ongoing acquisition and fielding of Western-supplied weapons and systems. The pace and quality of Russian military operations will in fact depend on the Ukrainian military’s ability to field systems capable of countering Russian tactics. In other words, the Russian military can still field a modernized T-62 tank (first unveiled in the early 1960s) on the battlefield even if this vehicle lacks sophisticated countermeasures or optics. But the effectiveness of these systems will be significantly offset by Ukraine’s continued access to more advanced Western technology such as Javelin, Stugna, or NLAW anti-tank weapons or precision-guided artillery. Additionally, the Russian military can continue to launch Iranian-provided Shahed-136 combat drones at Ukrainian energy infrastructure without worrying that most are shot down, placing the onus on the Ukrainian defenders to expend valuable air-defense ammunition. This is the crux of this war in its second year: the Russian military can rely on its mass and continue feeding older or less than state-of-the-art technology as long as it thinks it can simply outlast the Western deliveries of weapons and systems to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;3-sanctions-have-made-moscow-opt-for-a-slower-paced-attritional-campaign&quot;&gt;3. Sanctions have made Moscow opt for a slower-paced attritional campaign.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Russia has lost a significant number of military vehicles, which could limit its capacity for large-scale ground offensives. This could be one reason why the Russian government, and President Putin in particular, are presenting this war as a long-term endeavor necessary to ensure Russia’s security. Ensuring a long-term struggle that slowly exhausts Ukrainian weapons stocks while outlasting Western aid efforts appears central to Russia’s strategy in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At the same time, turning this war into a slow-paced attritional campaign creates a little breathing space for the sanctioned Russian domestic defense industry to come up with the necessary solutions and workarounds outlined in this report. There is some evidence that the Russian government and military are exhausted and would prefer this conflict to enter the concluding stage, managed by the international community. In a statement on February 28, 2023, a Kremlin spokesperson indicated that peace negotiations with Kyiv are possible if Russia gets to keep the Ukrainian regions it currently controls: Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhya, along with Crimea. But even if Kyiv were to agree to such negotiations, it remains unclear whether the Russian government would limit its ambitions to the regions it already occupies if Ukraine maintains its pro-Western political and military orientation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Thus, as long as the Kremlin maintains its current outlook on Ukraine, the war is expected to continue, with Moscow preferring a slower-paced attritional campaign without significant breakthroughs or advances that could put further pressure on its military and industrial base already stretched thin by sanctions and the last 12 months of the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;RECOMMENDATIONS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is not possible to completely control the flow of commercial parts that end up in the Russian military system, the authors of this report propose several ways for Western policymakers to close the loopholes actively used by the Russian government:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Continue supplying Ukraine with higher-end military equipment at a pace that exceeds Russia’s production rate, which will make it harder for Russia to maintain an attritional war.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Identify and target illicit networks, and particularly individuals involved in current sanctions-evasion efforts. In doing so, the United States should use its leverage in the post-Soviet region more proactively, including in Armenia, Georgia, and Kazakhstan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Restrict any existing transactions with Russian and Russia-linked defense companies and their affiliates. For example, Rostec subsidiaries and affiliated companies involved in civil aviation should be prevented from importing and sending sanctioned dual-use technologies to other Rostec affiliates involved in the production of different weapons systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eliminate the loopholes that allow some Western companies to import equipment into Russia by extending past contracts that preceded the imposition of sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Work toward creating an OFAC equivalent at EU level. Currently, the monitoring of sanctions implementation and compliance lies within the member states, which may lead to disparities, as EU states have varied capacity in this regard. Such a structure will require strong local expertise to perform the necessary investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;趙家賢指楊雪盈「好溫和務實」 認為入立會後應「自主行事」&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/3eEnUxk.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（13日）踏入審訊第42天。趙家賢接受代表楊雪盈的大狀張耀良盤問，形容楊雪盈是「好溫和務實嘅獨立議員」，積極推動藝術政策，很得較為建制守舊的大坑區居民歡心。趙曾與楊就協調會議討論，指楊亦知道戴耀廷是「成日有好多諗法」的人，亦與趙一樣是「理性溫和務實嘅性格」；就戴會上提及否決預算案，楊認為「咪由佢講吓先囉」，但認為入立法會後每個議員也是「自主行使權力」。趙亦沒有聽過楊提及要迫使特首下台或癱瘓政府。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙形容楊雪盈為好溫和務實嘅獨立議員-很得大坑區居民歡心&quot;&gt;趙形容楊雪盈為「好溫和務實嘅獨立議員」 很得大坑區居民歡心&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表吳政亨和余慧明的大律師石書銘今表示，就吳政亨已完成盤問，就余慧明則沒有盤問，其後代表楊雪盈的大律師張耀良開始盤問。趙家賢確認，於2015年楊雪盈參與區議會選舉時認識她，楊其後當選灣仔（大坑）區議員，二人雖屬不同區議會，但就公共服務有溝通和接觸，亦維持良好的工作關係。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙確認，楊雪盈沒有政治聯繫，當時在公共服務上亦是新手，並指雖然楊是新任議員，但「佢喺大坑嗰度係好得當地嘅居民嘅歡心」，又指與楊特別有聯繫，是因他中學時於大坑坊眾會有義工服務的聯繫。趙又指，知道該區是「比較上好建制好守舊」的選區，但楊雪盈以她對藝術的專業和在大坑的服務，「令到當地嘅居民知道，可能佢係相對上支持民主嘅信念……」，惟被張耀良打斷，指稍後會談及。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續確認，楊雪盈積極推動文化藝術政策及社區服務文化美學，亦常推動將政府撥款用於她倡議的文化及改善民生政策，並形容楊的社區參與撥款「好新穎」，「用咗一啲新嘅諗法而係好有效地服務到社區嘅居民」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙亦確認，楊雪盈於2019年區議會選舉連任，並當選灣仔區議會主席。張耀良一度問楊當選主席是否因為她較溫和，惟法官陳仲衡即打斷，指趙並不是投選楊的人，不能回答其問題。張改問楊的政治立場是否溫和，趙形容楊是「好溫和務實嘅獨立嘅議員」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱楊表示戴耀廷有想法由佢講吓強調議員入立會後自主行使權力&quot;&gt;趙稱楊表示戴耀廷有想法「由佢講吓」強調議員入立會後「自主行使權力」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張耀良續就「35+計劃」發問，趙同意自己甚少參與在港島區協調工作當中，並確認只出席過首次港島協調會議，而且遲到早退。張問到趙有否在會上聽到楊相當反對否決財政預算案，趙表示在會上沒有特別聽到，但會後有與楊討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，楊於2015年已經知悉戴耀廷對區議會選舉的計劃，「咁應該咁講，楊雪盈都知戴耀廷係成日有好多諗法嘅人，而楊雪盈同我都係嗰種理性溫和務實嘅性格」，因此兩人在會後傾談時，楊亦表示「戴耀廷又有啲佢嘅諗法又帶出嚟㗎啦，咪由佢講吓先囉，但即係選到入立法會裡面嘅時候，係每個議員自主行使個權力㗎嘛！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡問到兩人是否在首次協調會議後討論，趙稱忘記是哪次，但指在一些會議中途與楊就區議會工作交流時，有討論戴耀廷就「35+計劃」的協調事宜，並在法官陳仲衡追問下確認是在「墨落無悔」聲明出現前討論。翻查資料，楊雪盈名字曾出現在「墨落無悔」聲明。法官李運騰質疑，趙稱只是出席過首次會議並早退，因此他不會是在當日會後與楊討論，趙同意，並澄清自己是之後與楊用電話溝通。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱楊雪盈無特別提及迫特首下台或癱瘓政府&quot;&gt;趙稱楊雪盈無特別提及迫特首下台或癱瘓政府&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張續問，楊與趙對話中有沒有提過任何「35+計劃」的目標，包括要迫使特首下台或癱瘓政府？趙指楊沒有特別提到，只是提及戴耀廷的公開說法。張問，那據趙的印象，會否認為楊反對否決財政預算案？法官陳慶偉指趙已回答楊曾稱「由佢（戴耀廷）講吓」，趙同意，重申楊認為「佢（戴）好多諗法，由佢講囉」。陳問，即楊沒有表示支持或反對否決財案？趙同意，稱楊「淨係覺得之後入到立法會應該自主行事」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰再問，既然楊無意遵從協調會議共識，為何她仍然要參與「35+計劃」？趙表示，沒有與楊就最終有否參與官方選舉有特別討論，他亦指「所以如果你問我個人點樣解讀佢呢個行為嘅話…」，李打斷稱不是要他解讀，而是問他有否被告知，趙逐回應：「我冇同佢特別傾過，所以我唔太清楚」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;被問楊雪盈及戴耀廷是否朋友-趙稱兩人工作上有交流&quot;&gt;被問楊雪盈及戴耀廷是否朋友 趙稱兩人工作上有交流&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張耀良其後問到，楊雪盈與戴耀廷是否私下認識，但陳仲衡認為趙不能夠回答有關問題，李運騰亦指除非張指出兩人是朋友。陳慶偉於是改問，以趙所知，兩人實際上是否互相認識？趙回應「佢哋兩位係認識嘅」。陳再問到兩人是否朋友，這時在延伸庭的被告發笑，趙回答：「工作上有交流」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續舉例，指他在工作上認識張耀良多年，但不會真的稱他為朋友，律師席傳來大笑聲。張耀良一度欲修訂問題，指應問楊是否只「認得（recognise）」而非「認識（know）」戴耀廷，李運騰則指沒有太大幫助，指他們全部有出席協調會議，一定會認識對方。張終稱完成盤問，由代表彭卓棋的大律師盧敏儀續盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/8QMdGSk.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（13日）踏入審訊第42天。趙家賢繼續接受盤問，供稱只曾出席首次港島協調會議，與主問時稱曾出席首兩次不同。彭卓棋的代表大狀盧敏儀其後欲就會議情況澄清，惟法官陳慶偉質疑並不重要，並反問：「你認為這場審訊完結後，我們就會知道所有事情的真相嗎？」，又指刑事審訊證據常有不一致。此外，趙家賢在盤問下強調，民主動力僅承辦「35+公民投票」，而非整個「35+計劃」，民主動力的角色在初選勝出者當選後便結束。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙主問稱曾出席港島兩次會議惟盤問稱只出席首次-獲展示紀錄仍不能確認有否出席第二次&quot;&gt;趙主問稱曾出席港島兩次會議惟盤問稱只出席首次 獲展示紀錄仍不能確認有否出席第二次&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢今早接受代表楊雪盈的大狀張耀良盤問，形容楊是「好溫和務實嘅獨立議員」，認為入立會後議員應「自主行事」。趙並確認只曾出席過首次港島協調會議，而且遲到早退，與主問供稱曾出席首兩次會議不同。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙其後接受代表彭卓棋的大律師盧敏儀盤問。盧再問及趙家賢曾出席哪次港島協調會議，趙稱有出席首次3月26日的會議，至於有否出席4月17日的第二次會議則猶豫未能回答。盧續展示趙與民主動力總幹事黎敬輝的對話紀錄，黎於首次會議時曾稱「區軒開始」，趙回覆「Ok… coming」，趙確認有出席首次會議。盧問因此無需再展示第二次會議的紀錄？惟趙稱「抱歉盧大狀你可唔可以畀我睇埋」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;盧續展示紀錄，顯示第二次會議當天，趙曾向黎確認當天會開會，並着他協助做筆記。黎會議翌日凌晨發送筆記，趙於庭上花數分鐘讀畢，盧問他能否確認曾出席哪次會議？惟趙搔頭思索，未能回答。此時主控萬德豪打斷，表示趙在主問已表明曾出席第一和第二次會議。法官請趙家賢避席，萬續解釋，趙主問時是憑戴耀廷發送的出席者名單確認出席第二次會議，但辯方卻沒有展示該紀錄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡指，黎敬輝筆記是用來協助喚醒趙的記憶，法官陳慶偉亦指辯方有權發問，而控方有權覆問。盧敏儀一度道歉指她並非故意，惟法官李運騰指無需道歉，指證人剛才宣誓下的證供就是他只出席了首次會議，若與主問的證供有矛盾，控方可以覆問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方欲澄清趙家賢出席會議情況-官稱不重要反指審訊結束難言得知所有真相&quot;&gt;辯方欲澄清趙家賢出席會議情況 官稱不重要反指審訊結束難言得知所有真相&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉其後追問盧敏儀就此發問的用意，盧解釋，趙家賢曾稱司馬文在第二次會議上反對否決預算案，但黎敬輝的筆記無提及，希望澄清；法官李運騰亦補充，區諾軒指司馬文是在第一次會議提出反對。陳慶偉多次追問盧想帶出什麼（“What is your point?”），着她不要為問而問；盧解釋望作澄清，惟陳續指她大可在陳詞指有證供提及司馬文曾反對運用否決權，是哪一次會議提出並不重要。陳並問，盧是否想要削弱趙的證供和挑戰其可信性？盧重申她只是想確認司馬文的反對是在第一次抑或第二次會議發生，不希望陳詞變得混亂（messy）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉反問：「那有什麼問題？你認為這場審訊完結後，我們就會知道所有事情的真相嗎？（“What’s wrong with that? Do you think at the end of this trial, we would know the truth of everything?”）」盧敏儀回覆她盡力嘗試（trying my best）。但陳慶偉再指，在陪審團審訊也會提醒陪審員，他們是來決定被告就控罪是否有罪（determine the guilt of defendant in respect of the charge），但到了最後，也難以說能知道所有真相。盧終同意，只需知道趙家賢在他出席過的協調會議上有否聽過司馬文反對否決預算案，趙家賢返回法庭後確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方稱彭卓棋曾要求將政網全數移除-趙指沒有印象-截圖顯示彭政綱為空白&quot;&gt;辯方稱彭卓棋曾要求將政網全數移除 趙指沒有印象 截圖顯示彭政綱為空白&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢其後確認，一名叫「Christy」的女士是民主動力就初選項目的兼職員工，與總幹事黎敬輝等分擔處理初選候選人事宜。趙昨供稱，有政黨和候選人曾要求更改政綱，盧問趙是否知道誰要求更改？趙未有直接回答，而是重提其職員問他能否彈性處理有參選人要求修改政綱，但他無法指明是誰要求。李運騰續指若趙家賢直接說「不知道」可節省很多法庭時間（“It would save a lot of time if you simply say ‘I don’t know’.”），趙稱「抱歉法官閣下」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;盧敏儀續指，彭卓棋曾要求「Christy」將其政綱從電子投票系統和票站全數移除，惟趙稱沒有印象。盧續展示電子投票系統的截圖，顯示彭卓棋政綱一欄為空白，趙稱當時自己有投票，但「我只係撳咗個『揀選』然後就『確認』，我就冇撳入去啲政綱度睇」。趙亦沒有印象，有同事曾特別反映票站內沒有彭卓棋的政綱。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;盧敏儀其後問及，初選投票日前港島區是否有3次協調會議。法官陳慶偉再請趙避席，指根據其紀錄有4次，惟盧稱盤問時區改稱只有3次。陳慶偉再指相關問題不重要，盧重申不希望陳詞變得混亂，又指知道永遠找不到真相。陳再重申，刑事審訊呈交法庭的證據經常都會有出入和不一致之處（“There are always discrepancies and inconsistencies in evidence presented to court in criminal trial.”），着盧判斷何謂相關和重要的事情。控方之後確認區稱投票前只有3次港島會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢稱民主動力僅承辦35公民投票非整個35計劃-民動角色於勝選者當選後結束&quot;&gt;趙家賢稱民主動力僅承辦35+公民投票非整個35+計劃 民動角色於勝選者當選後結束&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;盧敏儀表示完成盤問，何啟明沒有盤問，續輪到自行代表的大律師劉偉聰。劉問根據原本計劃，「35+公民投票計劃」在立法會選舉結束後是否就會完結？趙家賢確認。法官陳仲衡續問，但初選有替補被DQ者的機制，民主動力在此有否任何角色？趙指，「呢個係兩位初選協調人佢哋負責，並唔係民主動力，因為民主動力淨係一個服務提供者。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續舉例，假若當選人在立法會拒絕宣誓效忠特區，便會被取消資格，故「35+計劃」直至官方選舉完結後也未結束？趙重申，民主動力負責承辦初選，「我哋嗰個角色淨係做嗰個35+嘅公民投票」，故他指的結束只是指民主動力承辦初選的角色結束，而非指整個計劃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡續問，那趙家賢7月16日也不需宣布退出協調，因當時初選投票已經結束？惟趙指，如當時沒有特別情況發生，民主動力仍需進行初選後的官方選舉前民意調查，而民調推薦的人當選後「其實我哋個角色就完」。陳續問，但民調後，民主動力仍要出席其他協調會議，以決定出選名單？趙同意，但指召集協調會議和處理協調並非民主動力角色。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉追問為何如此，指民主動力被挑選承辦初選，就是因其參與協調的背景和能力。趙同意，但重申是由戴耀廷和區諾軒進行協調，並同意陳慶偉指，當他說民主動力承辦初選時，該初選是狹義而言，而非指整個「35+計劃」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉偉聰問選舉按金會否於首份財政預算發表時發還-趙當時完全冇呢個思考&quot;&gt;劉偉聰問選舉按金會否於首份財政預算發表時發還 趙：當時完全冇呢個思考&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢其後確認，一萬元的選舉按金是確保參選人有遵守協調會議的共識。按金收據列明「選舉按金將於立法會選舉後全數發還」，劉偉聰問是指什麼時候？趙指若立法會選舉無延期，應指9月中的投票日，解釋在官方選舉投票日過後，參選人有否違反協調共識一事才會變得「清晰明確」；並指因事情性質輕微，故不曾就此與戴耀廷及區諾軒討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉續問，據趙理解，發還選舉按金的時間是會在立法會選舉後第一份財政預算案發表時嗎（as late as the introduction of the first budget after the election）？趙稱「回應劉大狀，完全冇呢個思考嘅當時」。劉其後表示完成盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官稱記得逃犯條例於19年9月撤回-趙稱政府首長曾用很多字眼惟市民不滿意&quot;&gt;官稱記得《逃犯條例》於19年9月撤回 趙稱政府首長曾用很多字眼惟市民不滿意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表林卓廷和黃碧雲的大律師沈士文稱盤問需時，陳慶偉續着押後至明日續審。陳其後主動提出，趙家賢昨供稱《逃犯條例》修訂草案於2019年6月撤回，惟以他個人記憶是在2019年9月。趙回應：「法官閣下，我只可以講其實係一個過程嘅階段，因為當時嘅政府嘅首長係用咗好多唔同嘅字眼，表達個法案已經唔會再運作、運用又好，或者壽終正寢又好，但市民大眾就係唔滿意啦」，並確認無論如何，草案就是於2019年被撤回。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明早續審。&lt;/p&gt;

On April 1, 2014, the government of Japan introduced the Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology (hereinafter referred to as the “Three Principles”) to replace the original Three Principles, allowing arms exports only when they contribute to the active promotion of peace and international cooperation, as well as Japan’s national security. The new principles included the Strategy on Defense Production and Technological Bases — which shifted away from the previous policy of maintaining all defense production and the technology base domestically to a policy of allowing some international joint development and joint production. The government has been working on defense equipment transfers under the new Three Principles ever since, but there has been only one transfer of a complete system: the sale of an air-defense radar system to the Philippines.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this trend continues, Japan’s defense industrial base will continue to decline. How can Japan reverse this trend and increase exports of defense equipment? This paper explores possibilities for Japan by comparing the defense export systems of other countries, including the U.S. foreign military sales (FMS) program, and assesses whether Japan needs its own version of FMS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-international-environment&quot;&gt;The International Environment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Japan’s 2022 National Security Strategy highlights, the security environment around Japan is “as severe and complex as it has been since the end of World War II.” Some nations (such as China, North Korea, and Russia) are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;increasing their own national interests at the expense of others . . . , expanding their influence through both military and non-military means, attempting to unilaterally change the status quo, and accelerating actions to challenge the international order. Such moves have sharpened competition and confrontation among states in wide-ranging areas, including military, diplomatic, economic, and technological fields, and have shaken the foundation of the international order. As a result, the current international security environment has become complex and severe, one where inter-state relations and interests of each and every nation are intertwined with each other in a mosaic-like manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, there are worsening risks that these countries could impede free access to and utilization of the cyber, maritime, space, and electromagnetic domains. In the field of international trade, some nations are using economic tools — such as “restricting the exports of mineral resources, food, and industrial and medical supplies, as well as providing loans to other nations” that cannot sustain that level of debt — to influence and coerce other nations. As balances of power shift, there is a lack of strong leadership within the global governance structure to address these issues. The international community is therefore struggling to take on shared challenges such as climate change, arms control, disarmament, nonproliferation, terrorism, food and energy security, and preventing the spread of infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These dynamics are particularly prominent in the Indo-Pacific region. China has been expanding its military power, including nuclear capabilities, and has intensified its attempts to use force to unilaterally change the status quo in the East and South China Seas around Taiwan and the Senkaku Islands. It is also “strengthening its strategic ties with Russia and attempting to challenge the international order.” Meanwhile, Chinese development finance is taking advantage of countries’ reliance on China to exert economic pressure on them. These activities, which are worrying Japan and the international community, present “the greatest strategic challenge in ensuring the peace and security of Japan and the international community, as well as in strengthening the international order based on the rule of law.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s efforts to rapidly expand its nuclear and missile capabilities also pose a graver and more imminent threat to Japan’s national security than before. Meanwhile, Russia’s aggression against Ukraine has “shaken the very foundation of the international order.” Not only is Russian aggression the most significant and direct threat to security in Europe, it has also raised concerns in Japan about how Beijing’s ties with Russia could impact security in the Indo-Pacific region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to potential adversaries’ growing capabilities in new and traditional forms of warfare, the government of Japan has concluded it is necessary to fundamentally reinforce Japan’s defense capabilities to protect its citizens. Japan’s new National Defense Strategy, also released in December 2022, notes the importance of both integrating all forms of national power to reinforce Japan’s defense capabilities and enhancing deterrence by strengthening the U.S.-Japan alliance and other forms of security cooperation with like-minded countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;japans-dwindling-defense-industrial-base&quot;&gt;Japan’s Dwindling Defense Industrial Base&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the decision to revise the Three Principles in 2014, only one transfer of a complete system has occurred since then, while the defense industrial base has shrunk as Japanese companies withdraw from the sector for several reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, even though the Three Principles allow defense equipment transfers in principle, the strict conditions in place effectively render exports the exception. Second, because most Japanese defense equipment is produced only for domestic procurement, it would be challenging to ensure they meet a purchasing country’s price, usage, and performance requirements. Third, the benefits of licensed production are no longer available: as defense systems have become more sophisticated and costly, international joint development and production have become the norm, and countries have become more reluctant to issue licenses for defense equipment containing sensitive technologies. In short, early licensed production of mature systems raised few technology-transfer problems, but newer, advanced defense systems naturally raise more releasability challenges. This has resulted in an increase in equipment imports from the United States through FMS, depriving domestic defense firms of opportunities to participate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If more domestic defense companies withdraw from the market, there is a risk of hindering the capabilities of the Japan Self-Defense Forces ( JSDF). Masashi Murano of the Hudson Institute has documented a case that captures the risk: In 2017, Japanese contractor Sumitomo Heavy Industries was able to quickly and affordably repair damage to the guided-missile destroyer USS John S. McCain. But if Japan’s defense industry shrinks further, this resilient logistics support capability will decline even in peacetime, slowing the operational tempo of both U.S. and Japanese forces — especially air defense, which requires faster turnaround times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address this situation, Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) Diet members introduced a proposal noting that since the defense industry is the foundation of Japan’s security, the government should assume the responsibility of sustaining and strengthening it — not just as part of industrial policy, but as a national security policy in and of itself. As it becomes more difficult to maintain a defense industrial base solely through domestic procurement, it is essential for Japan to find a way into overseas markets, both to make the industry more competitive and to boost national security. Furthermore, the overseas transfer of defense equipment — not only complete systems but also repair and maintenance of critical parts — would help promote defense cooperation with other countries in the Indo-Pacific, thereby securing the defense supply chains of partner countries and enhancing Japan’s strategic posture in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the LDP Diet members’ proposal, although the overseas transfer of defense equipment would require proactive efforts by the private sector, the government would have to guide these industry efforts. In deciding whether to allow defense equipment exports, Japanese defense agencies should not only factor in the price, usage, and performance of potential exports, but also the overall state of defense cooperation with the purchasing country. The government would also be responsible for offering training on and maintenance of the equipment, something private companies cannot handle alone, especially in developing countries that have local-content requirements. When bidding on international opportunities, competitors will likely be companies from other advanced countries, whose bids will reflect defense exports supported by national policy and public-private partnerships. As Japan is less experienced with defense equipment transfers, preparing competitive proposals will require Japan’s public and private sectors to build a new cooperative framework in which the government takes the lead in guiding collaboration with the private sector. The LDP Diet members put forth a Japanese version of FMS as one possible model for a “new system of public-private partnership.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The business community has voiced similar concerns. According to the Japan Business Federation’s proposal for a new National Security Strategy, Japanese defense-related companies should “implement domestic development with overseas transfers in mind and to build a system of public-private cooperation.” The government could support defense exports by providing capital investments to lower initial costs and usage fees, by expediting the transfer of information and equipment, and by providing operational support and training to recipient countries. To mitigate associated risks, the Japan Business Federation concluded:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;t is necessary to consider the establishment of a system under which the Japanese government receives orders for defense equipment from foreign governments, Japanese defense-related companies deliver the equipment to the Japanese government, and the Japanese government transfers the equipment to foreign governments (a Japanese version of the FMS system).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;benefits-of-fms&quot;&gt;Benefits of FMS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FMS is a form of government-to-government (G2G) transaction in which (as the name implies) the government becomes a contracting party to the purchase and sale of equipment. This is especially prevalent in the international defense market, where — contrary to all the other sectors of the globalized economy — legitimate purchasers are exclusively states, most suppliers are authorized to sell by their respective governments, and the state often directly or indirectly controls the defense industrial sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While government support for defense sales is not new, the past 20 years have witnessed a dramatic acceleration of government activities in this area. The globalization of defense markets, together with increased international competition and demand from outside Europe, has led traditional defense suppliers to use G2G agreements more frequently. G2G transactions feature several advantages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By strengthening their respective military capabilities, purchasing countries can deal more effectively with common threats. Russia and China similarly use sales of military equipment as part of “wider politico-military collaboration agreements.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Purchasing countries can implement a defense acquisition process faster through G2G transactions than through a commercial tender. Since the government is the contracting party, the approval of export licenses may be faster than for commercial contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;G2G transactions entail a public guarantee. Since the government is the contracting party, it facilitates the transfer of equipment. If there are problems with the equipment, the government — not just the supplier company — will be obligated to provide support.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Supplier companies can “set limits on the requests from purchasers to transfer technologies and know-how under the sales contract.” In fact, the U.S. FMS system restricts technology transfer as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;G2G transactions enable the transfer or sale of surplus equipment held by supplier country armed forces, shifting the costs of storing it to the purchasing country. This helps promote closer cooperation and integration between the countries’ militaries. A supplier country can also use free transfers to encourage the recipient to buy more advanced equipment in the future — as when Germany gave surplus Leopard tanks to other European countries, “paving the way for further acquisitions of later versions of the same tanks.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under G2G transactions, supplier companies also have an advantage during offset negotiations. The government of the supplier country can negotiate offsets on their behalf, and the scope of the offsets can more easily be broadened to include the entire domestic industry, thus reducing the burden on the supplier company.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FMS operations in the United States further illustrate the benefits for both supplier and recipient countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For U.S. suppliers, participation in the FMS system reduces administrative burdens. Not only are export licenses incorporated in the FMS process — with the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) managing all required paperwork and permissions — companies can rest easy that all transactions are in accordance with U.S. law, and recipient countries are assured that the acquisition process will be subject to the U.S. Department of Defense’s (DOD) standards through every step of the process. This also dramatically reduces U.S. companies’ risks: because they sign contracts with the DOD, not with a foreign customer, they are guaranteed to get paid and do not have to worry about being sued by recipient countries. This makes it easier for small and medium-sized U.S. defense companies to participate in the FMS system. FMS also creates opportunities for private suppliers to build on U.S. government sales. Since the U.S. government is essentially procuring goods on behalf of a foreign government, the defense companies they are sourcing from may more readily sell these products under FMS, especially those already registered as standard military parts and catalogued with a National Stock Number (NSN). This helps supplier companies expand into international markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the United States as a whole, FMS strengthens relations with recipient countries by nurturing long-term military relationships, including through access to joint training and doctrine and increased opportunities for standardization with U.S. forces. The United States generally tends to prefer FMS transactions over general exports because the U.S. government has more control over them, which is required for defense exports of sensitive technologies. In practice, defense equipment exports to major countries are a mix of FMS and Direct Commercial Sales (DCS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the customer, FMS purchases of equipment tend to be cheaper because orders can consolidated and/ or sourced from older U.S. military inventories. (Conversely, this creates a disadvantage in that the product is not new and cannot be customized for the recipient country. This is an increasingly serious problem in cases where customers prefer that sellers build “exportability” into future defense system development.) In addition, the total package approach FMS uses means that the purchase of a major system includes training, spare parts, and other support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the U.S. government — unlike with G2G transactions in other countries — does not participate in offset negotiations, preferring a “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy on negotiations between U.S. defense companies and recipient countries. This means that FMS recipient countries do not have to negotiate with the U.S. government, but nevertheless have access to sensitive equipment not available through DCS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FMS and G2G transactions are the same in that the government of the supplier country becomes a party to the contract. For convenience, this paper will refer to FMS as a system in which the government is more involved or acts as an intermediary — in effect becoming the customer for an industry supplier. This role applies not only to sales but also to the entire package, including technical support and services such as training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;feasibility-of-fms-in-japan&quot;&gt;Feasibility of FMS in Japan&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can Japan adopt an FMS system that has these advantages for both the supplier and recipient countries?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government of Japan has facilitated some transfers of defense equipment as a form of security assistance to regional neighbors. However, with little experience in international defense operations or exports, it is not able to replicate the complex U.S. FMS process. Many organizations are involved in the U.S. FMS network; DSCA alone employs more than 1,000 people. In addition, the United States holds a dominant share of the international defense market, with approximately 189 nations and international organizations participating in FMS procurements. The United States maintains alliances with many countries with whom it can use FMS transfers to promote standardization — which further contributes to these relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the United States has a defense budget and armed forces much larger than those of Japan, as well as established export markets that support its defense industrial base. In comparison, Japan’s defense industry is not investing in large-scale manufacturing facilities. Even if such facilities were built, it is not clear whether their products would be marketable. Other countries might not be willing to purchase Japanese equipment, which (unlike U.S. equipment) has not been proven through operational experience. In addition, there are no “pure” defense companies in Japan. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) is the largest Japanese defense contractor, but defense comprised only 12 percent of its business in 2021. Defense is also (rightly) viewed as a low-margin business by companies operating in more profitable commercial sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, perhaps there is another equipment export system besides the U.S. FMS model that Japan can use as a reference. Similar G2G transaction processes adopted by other countries may offer useful examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;france&quot;&gt;France&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;current-status-of-defense-exports&quot;&gt;Current Status of Defense Exports&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), in the 2017–2021 period, France’s global share of defense equipment export value was 11 percent, ranking it third in the world. This value grew by 59 percent compared to the previous five-year period (2011–16). Between 2001 and 2020, the total value of French defense exports to Europe declined, while those to all other regions grew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;background-of-defense-exports&quot;&gt;Background of Defense Exports&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France has a higher degree of government involvement in defense equipment exports than other countries. The French state and the defense industry are also structurally interdependent. According to an International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) report, French defense manufacturers are “in the privileged position of facing little competition in producing major weapons systems and selling them to the government.” The Direction Générale de l’Armement (DGA) in the French Ministry of Defense plays a key role by purchasing weapons and controlling defense industrial policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FRANCE’S DEFENSE EXPORT PROMOTION AGENCY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important instrument for promoting arms exports is the Direction du Développement International (DI), a department within the DGA that is tasked with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;coordinating interministerial initiatives; maintaining contacts with foreign officials with a view to opening new markets to French defense manufacturers; supervising exports by state-owned companies; . . . organising arms fairs in France; coordinating financial assistance for the defense industry; participating in contract negotiations [G2G]; and also offering an after-sales service that includes technical assistance for arms purchasers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONSISTENT ARMS-EXPORT DOCTRINE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon returning to power in 1958, President Charles de Gaulle insisted that France “should be independent from the two superpowers dominating the Cold War.” This required “an autonomous capacity to build weapons systems for the needs of its armed forces.” “Arms sales sustained an independent defense industry, which in turn sustained the French independent posture.” Thus, “success in the arms trade became a symbol of France’s capacity to defend itself — or the business ‘model of our sovereignty.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The doctrine that arms sales are indispensable to French sovereignty persists: “Arms exports were also regarded as benefiting the French economy as a whole, not only through their direct contribution to the balance of payments and job creation but also through spillover effects for civilian industry.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The absence of political debate about the direction of France’s arms-export policy means that, to a large extent, the bureaucracy has been allowed to be the arbiter of export controls.” This has made it easier for the French government to address increased competition in the global arms market by simplifying the export-control system and streamlining the processes by which defense companies receive authorization to export. This trend has continued throughout the post–Cold War era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FLEXIBLE DEFENSE EQUIPMENT EXPORTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IISS report notes that in addition to offering proven equipment, France sought to attract customers by “depicting itself as a country that did not attach political conditions to arms sales and would not cease deliveries if a customer’s political or military situation changed.” For example, France was “one of the main suppliers of arms to South Africa during the apartheid era.” In addition, “the lack of response from [Emmanuel] Macron’s government to mounting criticism over arms sales to countries involved in the war in Yemen – primarily Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates – suggests that the French arms-export doctrine is being maintained by the current president.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PUBLIC INVESTMENT BANK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The public investment bank Bpifrance provides state guarantees, insuring companies against the risk of non-payment. Through Bpifrance, “the state also secured credit provided by private banks to arms purchasers,” which “benefits the arms buyer by making it unnecessary for them to immediately pay the French manufacturer the full price of their acquisition – instead they can repay the bank in instalments.” Moreover, a defense manufacturer that wants to tailor a product to a particular foreign client can receive a government loan to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FRENCH VERSION OF FMS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A separate IISS report describes Belgium’s 2019 purchase of 442 French Griffon and Jaguar armored vehicles as “France’s first attempt to sell equipment using its own version of the U.S. FMS system.” This program, in which France purchases vehicles on Belgium’s behalf along with purchases for the French army, not only takes some of the pressure off the Belgian defense ministry but also leverages the French military’s economies of scale to lower the cost for Belgian equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Provisions for the Belgian program include close cooperation with France on education and training. However, unlike the U.S. FMS system, France makes no obligations or guarantees on behalf of Nexter, the French company producing these armored vehicles, regarding the price, time, and performance conditions set by the contract. Furthermore, “no liability of France is incurred in the event of termination of the agreement or of the supply protocol, or of the failure of one party, or the occurrence of an external event that permanently and irrevocably opposes the execution of the contract.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;Comment&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In France, in addition to the conventional G2G program centered on DI, there is a recent agreement with Belgium to export CaMo, a new generation truck-mounted artillery system. This has been called a French version of FMS because production for export is carried out in conjunction with production for the French army. However, this is not the same as the U.S. FMS system because of the lack of large government guarantees. France’s own version of FMS still benefits from the country’s flexible export policy, use of an investment bank for financing, and security environment that motivates other countries to purchase its equipment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;australia&quot;&gt;Australia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;current-status-of-defense-exports-1&quot;&gt;Current Status of Defense Exports&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to SIPRI data, during the 2017–21 period, Australia’s global share of defense equipment export value was only 0.6 percent, ranking it sixteenth in the world. However, compared to the 2011–16 five-year period, this value rose 97 percent, the third largest increase in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;background-of-defense-exports-1&quot;&gt;Background of Defense Exports&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEFENSE EXPORT STRATEGY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia has a Defense Export Strategy dedicated to the export of defense equipment, which is rare. The 2018 strategy “builds on the 2016 Defence Industry Policy Statement by setting out a comprehensive system to plan, guide, and measure defense export outcomes.” It has four parts: (1) crafting a strategic approach to defense exports; (2) understanding the global defense market; (3) establishing the new defense export system; and (4) implementing defense export success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This strategy notes that exports will boost future investment in Australia’s defense industry and create high-end manufacturing jobs. As it strives to make this industry stronger, more sustainable, and more globallycompetitive, the government has set five goals to reach by 2028:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“strengthen the partnership between the Australian Government and industry to pursue defence export opportunities;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;sustain Australia’s defence industrial capabilities across peaks and troughs in domestic demand;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;enable greater innovation and productivity in Australia’s defence industry to deliver world-leading Defence capabilities;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;maintain the capability edge of the Australian Defence Force and leverage Defence capability development for export opportunities; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;grow Australia’s defence industry to become a top ten global defence exporter.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This strategy shows the government’s commitment to working with Australian companies to expand export opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AUSTRALIA’S DEFENSE EXPORT PROMOTION AGENCY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Australian Defense Export Office (ADEO), established in April 2018 as part of the Defense Export Strategy, is the focal point for coordinating whole-of-government support for the Australian defense exports. ADEO is responsible for delivering the initiatives outlined in the Defense Export Strategy; working closely with an international network of defense attachés and business development managers in key markets; and engaging in G2G transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AUSTRALIAN MILITARY SALES (AMS)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the ADEO, the AMS office plans and executes G2G sales of matériel, sensitive technology, and services of the Australian defense industry. Its role is in “support[ing] Australian sovereign capability and military sales programs as well as promoting the Australian defence industry through:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;International Government-to-Government sale, gifting or other transfer of surplus Australian Defence Force (ADF) articles&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;International Government-to-Government purchase of Australian origin, sensitive technology, and ADF articles&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Supporting Australian defence industry to export to foreign government customers.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AMS office also publishes the Australian Defense Sales Catalogue, which provides information on ADF equipment and defense industry products and services sold to foreign governments. As part of these G2G transactions, surplus equipment is offered on an “as is, where is” basis, but new equipment can also be purchased. Prices may be specifically quoted or left to the market to decide, and payment is generally made in advance, but with flexibility in terms of delivery schedules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;comment-1&quot;&gt;Comment&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Australia has prepared a strategy document specifically for defense equipment exports; based on this, Australia is using AMS, a type of standardized G2G transactions, to expand defense equipment exports. This AMS is similar to the U.S. FMS model and would be very helpful for Japan.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;israel&quot;&gt;Israel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;current-status-of-defense-exports-2&quot;&gt;Current Status of Defense Exports&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to SIPRI data, during the 2017–21 period, Israel’s global share of defense equipment export value was 2.4 percent, ranking it 10th in the world. However, this value decreased by 5.6 percent compared to the 2011–16 period. Nonetheless, Israel remains a major arms exporter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel’s economy depends heavily on defense-related exports. It has “extensive military relations with 130 countries that have been investing in Israel for decades through imports, exports, training and other security and military cooperation.” Increasingly, exports are going to Southeast Asia and the Indo-Pacific, areas of rapid military modernization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;background-of-defense-exports-2&quot;&gt;Background of Defense Exports&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ISRAEL’S DEFENSE EXPORT PROMOTION AGENCY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SIBAT, the International Defense Cooperation directorate within Israel’s Ministry of Defense, maintains close ties with local defense companies, interfacing between industry and the defense establishment and staying on top of both technological developments and the operational needs of the Israeli Defense Force (IDF). Its mandate includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“[Signing] Government-to-Government agreements&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Initiating official foreign delegations&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Identifying business opportunities with Israeli defense industries&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finding technological solutions for specific operational requirements&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Establishing joint ventures&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conducting advanced training seminars&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Managing the sales of IDF inventory&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Providing quality assurance &amp;amp; technical support services for G-to-G agreements&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Providing in-depth information on Israel’s defense industry using a biennial directory&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Producing conferences; showcasing Israel’s technologies and capabilities under one roof at the Israel National Pavilion; attending global fairs &amp;amp; exhibitions and facilitating contact with participating industries”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROACTIVE UTILIZATION OF G2G TRANSACTIONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its limited resources compared to the United States, Israel excels at promoting G2G transactions that support exports by its small and medium-sized defense companies. The Israeli government recognizes that it cannot sustain its defense industry solely through domestic orders. As such, it has turned to G2G transactions to support its defense industrial base while still “preserving strategic autonomy and innovation potential.” By 2021, the value of G2G defense exports reached $3.365 billion, compared to $911 million in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel can export defense equipment through DCS under a government export license, but any exports that contain sensitive technology or are driven by national interests require the government to enter into a G2G arrangement with the purchasing country. For these large G2G deals, “the terms negotiated at a ministerial level enable both sides to reach agreements faster and at lower costs than commercial tender processes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The involvement of the Israeli government in arms sales benefits Israeli defense companies by allowing them to rely on the government in the event of trouble and benefits the purchasing country, which receives not only the equipment, but also education, training, and long-term maintenance by the IDF. Israeli G2G transactions differ from the U.S. FMS system in that the Israeli Ministry of Defense does not directly buy weapons from Israeli defense companies (such as Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and Elbit Systems) and export them to purchasing countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FLEXIBLE DEFENSE EQUIPMENT EXPORTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel has adopted a flexible approach to arms exports and military assistance programs, using them to advance the country’s broader foreign policy objectives. It has supplied defense systems even to countries with human rights concerns, such as the Philippines under President Rodrigo Duterte and Myanmar, and to countries experiencing conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;comment-2&quot;&gt;Comment&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Israel is promoting government-led equipment exports by making full use of G2G transactions, although not to the same extent as the U.S. FMS system. In addition, Israel’s experience in actual warfare and its flexible equipment exports are also contributing to the growth of its defense exports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;south-korea&quot;&gt;South Korea&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;current-status-of-defense-exports-3&quot;&gt;Current Status of Defense Exports&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to SIPRI data, during the 2017–2021 period, South Korea’s global share of defense equipment export value was 2.7 percent, ranking it eighth in the world. However, compared to the 2011–16 period, this value rose by 177 percent, the biggest increase of any country. South Korea’s arms exports have multiplied more than sixfold since 2005; in 2021 they exceeded imports for the first time. Beyond North America, regions targeted for exports now include Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;background-of-defense-exports-3&quot;&gt;Background of Defense Exports&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOUTH KOREA’S DEFENSE EXPORT PROMOTION AGENCY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In South Korea, a lack of transparency, dispersed organizational management, and insufficient management of financial resources in the existing acquisition system had led to inefficiency and weakened the competitiveness of the defense industry. As a result, as of January 1, 2006, the defense acquisition structures of eight different defense institutions — including the Ministry of Defense, Joint Chiefs of Staff, each military branch and the Defense Procurement Agency — shut down, and these functions were brought under the new Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA), an administrative center with the role of “improvement of defense capabilities, promotion of the defense industry, [and] procurement of munitions.” To make Korean defense exports more competitive, DAPA is also “designing regional strategies for strengthening export competitiveness and actively carrying out international cooperation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STRONG LEADERSHIP, UTILIZATION OF TOP SALESPEOPLE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In South Korea, the success or failure of policies to promote the domestic defense industry and proactively export equipment overseas have largely depended on the leadership of President Moon Jae-in, who served from 2017 to 22. The strength of South Korea’s equipment export project stems from the fact that under President Moon’s leadership, political leaders, the government, industry, and the military have come together under a unified structure. “Top sales,” in which the president directly pitches to other heads of state, are now commonplace, and defense industrial cooperation is often an important issue on the agenda during diplomacy with partner countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UTILIZATION OF NATIONAL DEFENSE DIPLOMACY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea has long used “defense diplomacy,” both passive forms such as military exchanges and cooperation and “active military diplomacy, such as political ties with allied countries or the deployment of military forces abroad at the request of allied nations or international organizations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea is using this defense diplomacy to sell equipment. For example, it deployed troops to Iraq from 2003 to 2008 and in December 2013 concluded a sales contract with Iraq for T-50 training aircraft, following the improvement of bilateral ties based on the reputation of the South Korean military there. In 2013, South Korea participated in typhoon relief efforts in the Philippines and held an event commemorating its participation in the Korean War, thereby establishing friendly relations and paving the way for a March 2014 contract to sell the Philippines FA-50 light attack aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CUSTOMIZED EXPORTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea is seizing commercial opportunities through “customized” exports based on meticulous market research. This sales approach “thoroughly examines the security environment, financial situation, and industrial structure of the customer and flexibly considers sales methods.” Sometimes, this results in “joint production with local companies, second-hand sales, and financial support,” tying negotiations to government economic assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UTILIZATION OF DCS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea does not use G2G transactions for defense sales. Given the country’s history of military coups, this is to avoid a public backlash against direct military involvement. The South Korean government has been limited to providing follow-up services such as training and maintenance after equipment sales, as it has done in Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is expected that G2G transactions will be adopted in the future. That is why it is difficult for one company alone to promote exports, as defense trades are generally based on mutual trust between the governments involved. Since its establishment in 2006, DAPA has taken the role of directly selling defense articles as requested by a purchasing government. These kind of G2G transactions enable follow-on logistics support for an exported weapon system and serve as a starting point for secondary exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ADVANTAGES FOR PURCHASING COUNTRIES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea’s $15 billion defense acquisition framework agreement with Poland “could become Seoul’s most lucrative defense export package to date.” According to the Polish minister of national defense, the contract was concluded because of the excellent level of quality, speed of shipment, and of involvement of Polish industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, South Korea has supported defense exports with license production and technology transfer arrangements, including in Indonesia (amphibious vessels and submarines), Egypt, and India (K9 self-propelled howitzer).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HIGH DEFENSE R&amp;amp;D EXPENDITURES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 2022 fiscal year, South Korea had a high research and development (R&amp;amp;D) expenditure of approximately 400 billion yen ($3 billion), or 100 billion yen ($0.75 billion) more than Japan did. This high R&amp;amp;D investment is likely the reason behind the development of numerous competitive products such as the K9 artillery system and the FA-50 and T-50 aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;comment-3&quot;&gt;Comment&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;South Korea has not yet introduced G2G transactions. However, under strong presidential leadership, DAPA has taken the lead in a whole-of-government approach to defense exports, which have been increasing at a breakneck pace as a result. This trend is due not only to the cost performance of the equipment, but also to the other promotions included in the sales package. The introduction of G2G transactions will make it easier for South Korean companies to participate in equipment exports, as they will be guaranteed by the government.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;germany&quot;&gt;Germany&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;current-status-of-defense-exports-4&quot;&gt;Current Status of Defense Exports&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to SIPRI data, in the 2017–2021 period, Germany’s global share of defense-equipment export value was 4.5 percent, ranking it fifth in the world. However, compared to the 2011–16 period, this value fell by 19 percent. Nonetheless, German arms exports hit a new record in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;background-of-defense-exports-4&quot;&gt;Background of Defense Exports&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UTILIZATION OF DCS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Germany also does not use G2G transactions for defense sales, given the nation’s history during World War II and public concerns over the direct involvement of the military. However, the German government certainly provides support for such exports. For example, it backs sales of German submarines and tanks with training by the German armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STRONG DEFENSE INDUSTRY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Germany has traditionally been a manufacturing powerhouse, with its products known for their high quality and reliability. This is also true for defense systems: the Leopard 2 tank is highly valued by various countries, and conventional submarines of German design are in service throughout the world. The efficiency and competitiveness of its defense industry places Germany in a very favorable position in the international market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXPORT POLICY BECOMING MORE FLEXIBLE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;German arms-export policy is governed by EU law (such as Council Common Position 2008/944/CFSP of December 8, 2008, which sets criteria for member states to use in issuing export licenses), the German Constitution (in particular, Article 26 (2) of the Basic Law, which requires licenses for all manufacture, transportation, and distribution of weapons), other national laws (including the War Weapons Control Act, the Foreign Trade and Payments Act, the Foreign Trade and Payments Ordinance), and the Political Principles of the Federal Government for the Export of War Weapons and Other Military Equipment. Exports are strictly controlled by export licenses issued in accordance with these regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Germany’s legal framework has made it difficult to directly export defense equipment to countries with human rights violations. However, according to the Bonn International Center for Conversion (BICC), “in 2019, Germany approved arms exports to 55 states whose human rights situation were classified as ‘very poor.’” Germany’s Enable &amp;amp; Enhance Initiative allows for the export of dual-use technologies to support crisis management and post-conflict and peace-building operations, generally destined for countries considered unstable. In addition, German companies are increasingly relocating production of defense equipment abroad and then exporting to third countries via subsidiaries to circumvent arms-export regulations. Further, German companies also are allowed to support the development of defense industrial capacity abroad in less sensitive defense fields, which also facilitates the international production of defense equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to complying with the letter of EU and other international agreements, Germany has generally avoided exporting arms to parties to a conflict. However, Germany recently reversed this long-standing policy to provide Ukraine with defensive weapons. This may set a precedent for future defense exports to warring countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;comment-4&quot;&gt;Comment&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Germany has not adopted formal G2G transactions for defense exports. In part due to negative popular views on the arms trade, Germany has generally followed strict arms-export rules. However, even with these strict restrictions, “loophole-like practices” have been expanding under the guise of contributing to international peace. Germany is also expanding its arms exports due to the capabilities of its outstanding defense industry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Practices of a country may overlap in more than one category. The categories listed reflect increasing levels of government involvement and guarantees; they may overlap on detailed points but reflect an evolution in favor of government involvement in defense equipment exports. The degree of government involvement does not depend on G2G contracts (for example, South Korea has become a heavy promoter of defense exports even though it exclusively uses DCS).

&lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-recommendations-for-japan&quot;&gt;Policy Recommendations for Japan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the export-promotion strategies of these major exporters of defense equipment, this paper presents eight recommendations — listed in order of priority — for expanding Japan’s own such exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-utilize-g2g-transactions-make-the-japanese-government-a-contracting-party&quot;&gt;1. Utilize G2G Transactions (Make the Japanese Government a Contracting Party)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The policy of promoting overseas exports of defense equipment under national leadership is clearly stated in the new Defense Buildup Plan, to which the government should make a firm commitment. Even if Japan does not introduce an FMS system like that of the United States (or France), where the government is more involved, it should utilize G2G transactions and become a contracting party negotiating directly with the government of the purchasing country. (The 2020 transfer of air surveillance radar systems to the Philippines was not a G2G transaction as defined in this report because the contract itself was between Mitsubishi Electric Corporation and the Philippine Air Force.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the defense industry, both supplier and purchasing governments are involved to varying degrees. In such a unique market, it would be unreasonable for Japanese defense companies to negotiate with the government of the purchasing country. Negotiations under G2G transactions would reduce this burden for Japanese defense companies and allow them to concentrate on improving their performance, such as by engaging with companies in the purchasing country — as neither government nor industry talks will work without the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, it is common in the defense market for the purchasing country to insist on offset conditions. Since negotiations on these may extend beyond the defense industry, government involvement would benefit both suppliers and purchasers. It would also facilitate sales because the government will be providing a sense of security by endorsing the defense equipment being exported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;G2G transactions also make it relatively easy to sell associated services. In the case of the F-35, for example, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries hosts the maintenance, repair, overhaul, and upgrade depot for the Indo-Pacific region. Similarly, Japan should do the maintenance of F-15s, U.S. fighter jets deployed by other Asian countries. It is difficult to transport the engines to the United States every time to conduct maintenance. The only Asian countries that can service the engines of fighter jets are Japan, South Korea, and Australia, so selling this service would be profitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-establish-a-new-equipment-export-promotion-agency&quot;&gt;2. Establish a New Equipment Export Promotion Agency&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new specialized agency in charge of G2G transactions for defense equipment exports should be established within the Japanese government akin to South Korea’s DAPA, France’s DI, or Israel’s SIBAT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the export of defense equipment involves various government bodies such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA); Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI); MOD; the Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics Agency (ATLA); and the National Security Secretariat (NSS) in the prime minister’s office, it would be most effective to place export authority under an interagency organization such as NSS. This would help overcome stovepiping and bureaucratic rivalries among government agencies. Housing such an agency under the NSS would also give the public the impression of a whole-of-government approach like South Korea’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new export promotion agency should create a Japanese Defense Export Strategy like Australia’s. This would help explain the strategy to the Japanese public, which is still resistant to exporting defense equipment, and gain support from the defense industry and other government sectors. The new agency should also draw on private sector businesses experienced in defense transactions, such as trading companies. As evidenced by the failure of Japan’s attempt to export Soryu submarines to Australia in 2016, close coordination with the defense industry is essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-strengthen-rd-related-to-security&quot;&gt;3. Strengthen R&amp;amp;D Related to Security&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until recently, defense R&amp;amp;D expenditures in Japan were limited. However, in the proposed 2023 budget, defense R&amp;amp;D expenditures rose significantly to 896.8 billion yen, a threefold increase from the previous fiscal year. While this is commendable, the government should further strengthen support for technology research. This could include establishing a defense-focused think tank that can ask industry to carry out technological research based on a clear definition of requirements and attendant capabilities for defense operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also essential to have an R&amp;amp;D hub inside the government. For example, MOD, METI, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) are working to create a joint research institute to develop quantum and cyber-related technologies with national security applications. Since MOD lacks enough personnel with the expertise to identify important civilian technologies, it benefits from coordinating with METI and MIC, which are more familiar with these technologies and their potential military applications. One engineer from the private sector called for the government to inject 1 trillion yen in funds every year for research that these officials can conduct at their own discretion, noting that, “If the government takes the initiative with a budget, we [engineers] would do anything.” Japan is generally praised for engineering capacity that generates advanced capacities, but it lacks a mechanism for applying such ingenuity to the realm of security. In contrast to industrial policy, where fear of failure often leads to risk aversion, it will be important to encourage taking risks in defense technology research and accept failure even when large amounts of money are allocated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a country with no recent combat experience, the development of defense equipment using cutting-edge technology will help Japanese industry become more internationally competitive. Japan’s new National Defense Strategy states that “Japan will establish a new research institution in MOD to find multi-use cutting-edge technologies that contribute to defense equipment development, and to produce equipment that leads to defense innovation.” This should be an urgent priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4-promote-deregulation&quot;&gt;4. Promote Deregulation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since export criteria should be transparent and supportive of Japanese industry, the Three Principles for arms exports should be further revised to clarify the government’s strategy and criteria for defense equipment exports. Currently, the government can make exceptions on a case-by-case basis, but the principles do not include a transparent process for Japanese defense companies to follow. For example, current rules state that fighter aircraft cannot be exported to countries not involved in their joint development, but this should be made possible to support the defense industrial base. Not counting international joint development and production, equipment considered for transfers is essentially limited to five categories of use (rescue, transportation, warning, surveillance, and minesweeping).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, under the current policy, defense equipment cannot be transferred to a country engaged in conflict, but countries responding to aggression — such as Ukraine — should be able to receive support from Japan. As mentioned above, Germany, France, Israel, and other countries have increased their sales partly by exporting defense equipment to parties involved in conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the Three Principles note that “prior to overseas transfer of defense equipment and technology, the Government will in principle oblige the Government of the recipient country to gain its prior consent regarding extra-purpose use and transfer to third parties in order to ensure appropriate control of the defense equipment and technology after the overseas transfer.” Japan should make this policy more flexible by giving purchasing countries the responsibility for overseeing their use for other purposes. As mentioned above, South Korea allows purchasing countries to resell equipment to other buyers without approval, an approach that has increased sales. Japan should establish an efficient process for reviewing transfer requests and relax requirements for end users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s new National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy state that the Three Principles, their implementation guidelines, and other procedures should be revised to promote the smooth transfer of defense equipment and technology and international joint development in a broad array of fields. Deregulation and flexibility will prove critical in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;5-encourage-low-interest-government-loans&quot;&gt;5. Encourage Low-Interest Government Loans&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the international defense market, it is common for developing countries to request low-interest loans as a condition of purchase. However, since private financial institutions are often unable to agree on interest rates and other terms, these purchases are sometimes abandoned. The Japanese government should provide low-interest loans to developing countries — perhaps modeled on those of Bpifrance — to increase defense equipment exports. Japan could encourage its defense companies to use the government-funded Nippon Export and Investment Insurance (NEXI) system, which provides insurance for high-risk overseas transactions that are not covered by private insurance companies, to support financing for defense equipment exports to developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s new National Defense Strategy states that “Japan will carry forward with the transfer of defense equipment and technology in the joint public and private efforts by establishing a fund, and implementing measures including providing corporate assistance as necessary to smoothly promote such transfers.” Such efforts should also prioritize supporting developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;6-utilize-high-level-government-representation&quot;&gt;6. Utilize High-Level Government Representation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan should consider adopting the “top sales” model used by South Korea and various European countries. Staff from the proposed defense equipment export agency could accompany the prime minister on overseas trips to actively promote defense products. The ministers of foreign affairs; defense; and economy, trade, and industry should do the same when they travel abroad, as should officials from other relevant agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan should also exercise defense diplomacy. This does not mean that Japan should actively participate in conflicts (which is constitutionally prohibited) but that it could take advantage of its involvement in UN-led and other multinational peacekeeping operations to promote its defense equipment. For example, outdoor bathing systems, water supply vehicles, and water purification vehicles used for disaster relief could prove attractive, as could Japan’s expertise in de-mining using its Type 92 Mine Rollers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Export promotion should also be assigned to Japanese defense attachés and other embassy staff (e.g., defense teams) stationed overseas. (These same offices will also need to be strengthened to enable more effective management of Japanese defense procurement.) It will be important to designate a point of contact in charge of defense exports within Japanese embassies or other government institutions, as Japanese defense companies sometimes do not know with whom to talk about defense equipment exports. These officials should also be tasked with gathering information on host-nation defense requirements that would be suitable for Japanese exports. Efforts should initially focus on researching the demand for Japanese equipment in Southeast Asian countries, which is important for countering China in the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;7-encourage-corporate-restructuring&quot;&gt;7. Encourage Corporate Restructuring&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the end of the Cold War, many Western countries reduced their defense budgets, leading to widespread consolidation and restructuring of related industries. However, in Japan, there has been no integration and restructuring among defense contractors. Consolidating and integrating major firms like MHI and Kawasaki Heavy Industries (KHI) would be difficult, but this approach could prove successful for smaller companies. In the future, Japan should seek to consolidate major defense contractors into companies that are not just departments within large corporations. In other words, Japan should create companies more like Lockheed Martin, BAE Systems, Diehl Defence, and Saab AB — whose work is primarily focused on defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The production of ammunition provides a good example of Japan’s dilemma: “A rifle cartridge consists of a bullet, a shell casing, an ammunition belt, and a primer. Each of these is manufactured by a different company. Of course, the gunpowder is [manufactured by] another company.” If any one company in this inefficient supply chain fails, the manufacture of ammunition is delayed. It seems possible to integrate and reorganize these companies or have them be incorporated into major firms such as MHI and KHI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;8-champion-two-way-flows-of-investment&quot;&gt;8. Champion Two-Way Flows of Investment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help the Japanese defense industry, the government should promote collaboration with foreign companies that have international expertise, starting with small components and then gradually transitioning to larger systems. In this context, it is important that there be two-way flows of investment with foreign partners in the defense industry. For example, foreign defense manufacturers should be allowed to invest in Japanese defense companies — which, in turn, should be able to work with international partners on projects beyond those commissioned by the JSDF. Realizing this objective will require a marketing license process, which would enable Japan’s defense industry to engage potential international partners beyond the country’s existing joint defense programs. The Japanese government should learn from the U.S. Department of State’s efforts to support the activities of defense companies by clarifying the DSP-5 marketing license process. Without such measures, Japan’s defense industry will never be competitive and defense exports will remain limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A whole-of-government strategy is needed in order for Japan to better promote defense equipment exports. This export strategy should include measures to manage export controls and information security; create an export-promotion agency; strengthen government expertise and representation overseas; and promote not only exports but also support services. In addition, Japan’s defense industry cannot remain passive and should engage with the international community through marketing, joint R&amp;amp;D, and overseas investment activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measures should be modest at first, focusing on a realistic level of support for defense equipment export activities before expanding as the capabilities and experience of the Japanese government and defense industry develop. At some point, the government will also have to consider introducing a Japanese version of FMS and restructuring the defense industry as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;工作報告寫民動3月開始協助初選-趙稱僅列席會議報告為簡單描述&quot;&gt;工作報告寫民動3月開始協助初選 趙稱僅列席會議、報告為「簡單描述」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後展示民主動力2019至2020年的工作報告，當中提及民主動力於2020年3月19日曾發布帖文「回應有關立法會協調工作及民間要求初選安排的意見」，指趙家賢和總幹事獲區諾軒及黃大仙和觀塘區議會正副主席邀請，參與多次九龍東協調會議，在戴耀廷主持下結論九東可採取「棄選」機制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;該工作報告亦有章節以「獲委託承辦民主派35+公民投票」為題，提及「2020年3月開始，戴耀廷副教授及區諾軒前立法會議員主導，民主動力協助，各區議會民主派正副主席主持，以『團結一致，立會過半』為目標，與民主派人士於各區進行協調會議。最終民主派人士達成協議共識，一致決定舉行『民主派35+公民投票』。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢確認描述正確。趙早前曾供稱民主動力於5月才正式答應承辦初選，法官陳仲衡提到，文件提及民主動力於2020年3月已協助初選？趙回應，民主動力在3月有獲邀列席協調會議，就辦初選的技術範疇等表達意見，而報告的句子「唔係一個好長嘅句子」，「所以就用咗『協助』呢個簡單描述」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問五大訴求-趙多番猶豫始回答-稱逃犯條例於2019年6月獲撤回&quot;&gt;官問五大訴求 趙多番猶豫始回答 稱《逃犯條例》於2019年6月獲撤回&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪表示完成主問，法官陳慶偉續問趙，以他理解「五大訴求」是什麼？趙低頭思考約10秒，再低聲說「撤回呢個逃犯條例，然後就係……成立由法官主持嘅獨立調查委員會去調查整個事件」。陳慶偉問是什麼事件，趙稱是整個反修例運動，即為何會有民怨及後續的衝突事件。至於餘下訴求，趙思考一會指包括「釋放被捕人士同埋係可以撤銷控罪」，其後再指「然後就係……erm……係……要求……要求呢個雙普選盡快推動……同埋係取消612嘅暴動定性」。余慧明聞言搖頭嘆氣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續問，趙家賢是否記得《逃犯條例》何時撤回？趙再靜默約5秒稱「喺（2019年）6月底左右嘅時間」，余慧明面露驚訝發笑。趙指，6月12日後中國駐英大使表示《逃犯條例》修訂並非國家中央的要求，「而係香港地區自行提出」，而政府其後於2019年6月撤回《逃犯條例》修訂草案，趙指當時行政長官用「唔太確認嘅字眼」，令民怨繼續積累。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，趙是否同意至2020年3月，撤回《逃犯條例》已不再重要（non-issue）？趙指「技術上係」。李再問，即使《逃犯條例》已撤回，反對政府或對政府不滿的人，是否仍不會感滿足？趙同意，解釋「五大訴求」後有「缺一不可」，意思就是「綑綁式」，「一定係幾個元素都係要符合到市民想要求嘅嘢，大家先會收貨」，並同意截至現時為止，其餘四項訴求均未有實現。翻查資料，時任行政長官林鄭月娥於2019年6月15日宣布「暫緩」修例，至9月才正式宣布「撤回」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢自2013年認識鄭達鴻於區議會共事多年-不視鄭為本土抗爭派&quot;&gt;趙家賢自2013年認識鄭達鴻、於區議會共事多年 不視鄭為本土抗爭派&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後由代表鄭達鴻和梁國雄的大律師黃宇逸進行盤問。趙家賢確認，自2013年起認識鄭達鴻，當時趙是東區區議員，鄭是公民黨地區發展主任，鄭並於2015年當選東區（丹拿）區議員，二人在不同委員會事務、地區工作和海濱發展等合作，曾跟進擴建東區醫院和發展東區行人板道等項目。趙同意，鄭作為區議員集中於民生議題，形容他「好勤力」。法官陳仲衡一度反問那不正是區議員的工作本質？趙同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙同意，知道鄭達鴻2018年取得法學博士學位，而他和鄭均於2019年連任東區區議員，鄭任規劃工程及房屋事務委員會主席，二人亦同屬康體藝術文化發展工作小組。黃宇逸續引報導指該文化小組曾申請20萬辦「東區足球隊」，惟法官指與案無關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙其後在法官陳仲衡詢問下確認，不認為鄭達鴻是本土抗爭派，並在辯方追問下同意視鄭達鴻為傳統民主派。趙曾供稱2019年區選後本土派令地區事務政治化，惟他在盤問下確認，他和鄭2019年後於區議會通過撥款時，「係會經過思考去理性嘅處理」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指國安法生效後公民黨要求將政綱修訂為無字政綱-趙無印象&quot;&gt;辯方指《國安法》生效後公民黨要求將政綱修訂為「無字政綱」 趙無印象&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;民主動力負責收集初選提名表格，趙家賢指收集表格的電郵是由職員和秘書處處理，他沒有登入權限，但職員會向他「綜合性」匯報收到多少份提名表格。黃宇逸續問，《國安法》生效後，趙是否得悉公民黨曾要求修改政綱？趙指當時同事有向他匯報各候選人情況，籠統地提及有政黨參選人要修改政綱，但沒指明哪個政黨。黃續指，公民黨是要求將政綱換成「無字政綱」，趙不解問「無字政綱」意思是什麼，陳慶偉指應是空白的政綱，問趙當時是否知悉。趙指「多謝法官閣下提點」，並指記得同事稱有政黨本來政綱空白，其後再呈交政綱望更新，即與黃所說的情況相反。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，趙是何時獲告知該情況？趙指「冇乜太大印象」，僅稱6月24日公布提名名單後一星期，仍有進行修改更新。李續問，提名表格是否會連同政綱一同繳交？趙指當時有選舉團體交了提名表格後，要求遲數天或一星期才補交政綱，解釋民間選舉可以「彈性處理」。被問收到政綱後會如何處理，趙稱會將參選人資料和政綱張貼在票站外，讓選民投票前查閱，並指提名期完結後，總幹事黎敬輝曾將所有初選參選人的政綱上載至Google雲端硬碟並公開連結，他曾載入該連結簡單查看，但沒有深究鄭達鴻政綱內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/yMxI66e.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（12日）踏入審訊第41天。時任民主動力召集人趙家賢今接受盤問，重申戴耀廷在民主動力未答允辦初選時聲稱已邀請民動，令與會者產生期望，民動若不答應「唔單止中晒箭」，亦會因期望落差太大而構成無形壓力，形容戴很多時「夾硬嚟」、「順住個勢」令人按其意願做事。趙又同意，雖初選提名表格「支持協調會議共識」的條款寫法「籠統」，惟各區否決預算案的共識仍然存在，又形容是予不同光譜人士「彈性」向支持者和黨內人士交代。此外，趙指曾與鄭達鴻在區議會共事數年，形容他很細心和理性討論政策，不確定他是否一定會否決預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙同意35計劃目標籠統fb帖文無提五大訴求為目標&quot;&gt;趙同意「35+計劃」目標「籠統」、FB帖文無提「五大訴求」為目標&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢續接受代表鄭達鴻和梁國雄的大律師黃宇逸盤問。趙曾在2021年6月21日的錄影會面紀錄中形容，初選提名表格要求確認支持協調會議共識的條款寫法「籠統」，黃問趙是否認為「35+計劃」的目標是「籠統」？趙同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃續展示趙2020年6月9日的Facebook帖文，指「35+計劃」目標如下：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;增加民主派在立法會選舉地區直選及功能界別所獲的議席&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;民主派取得地區直選及功能界別的議席超過35個（35+），合計過半&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;民主派奪取全體投票的主導權，即立法會的完全控制權&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙同意上述3點是「35+計劃」目標，惟法官李運騰質疑，這3點不包括於各區協議都列明的「五大訴求，缺一不可」。趙同意，解釋帖文只是複製民主動力的Facebook帖文，「即係一雞兩味咁用法」，亦非由他所撰寫，他不太知道為何不包括「五大訴求」。趙其後同意帖文背景有提及「五大訴求」，亦確認發文前同意內容，指「我發咗出嚟我要負責嘅」，並補充帖文只是宣傳初選、讓公眾知道方向。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱條款雖籠統但否決預算案共識仍存在-指予彈性向支持者交代&quot;&gt;趙稱條款雖「籠統」但否決預算案共識仍存在 指予「彈性」向支持者交代&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就初選提名表格的第二項條款「支持和認同由戴耀廷及區諾軒主導之協調會議共識」，黃宇逸問，共識是否不包括參選人在當選後須否決預算案？趙回答字眼雖「籠統」，但「各個區嘅共識係存在嘅」。陳慶偉續問，是否即使表格字眼籠統，就運用否決權的字眼亦有不同，但協調會議就運用否決權已達成共識？趙同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢昨亦形容，該條款如「九二共識」，「一個中國，各自表述」，本土派和傳統民主派可各有解讀。黃宇逸再問，是否即該條款不代表參選人一旦當選，必須否決預算案？趙解釋因各區協議字眼不同，部分為「會積極運用」否決權，部分為「會運用」，而該提名表格是五個地方選區均會用到，「我冇理由喺表格度咁仔細去寫」。法官李運騰問，故如何理解該條款，仍是取決於本土派和傳統民主派各自的詮釋？趙指應是說「有多少少彈性，係比唔同政治光譜嘅人士，去同支持者或者係黨內嘅人士做一個交代」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙確信戴耀廷發送的協調文件為最終版本無組織者稱文件不準確&quot;&gt;趙確信戴耀廷發送的協調文件為最終版本、無組織者稱文件不準確&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙同意，從戴耀廷口中得知各區會議已達成共識，但部分選區只去過頭一次會議，包括新界東。黃宇逸續問，因此當戴稱各區已達成共識，趙不會知道其說法是否屬實？趙稱2020年6月8日，即召開初選記者會前一天，他曾在組織者群組要求戴將所有協調會議的最後協議版本發送出來，同在群組的區諾軒亦收到。趙續指，其後「墨落無悔」聲明出現，群組就此討論，趙曾回應「雖然份嘢冇白紙黑字簽，但當時嚟講都係mutually agreed 的 consent」，而戴耀廷或區諾軒均無否定其說法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，他曾問區諾軒各區會議的情況，區指他不是所有會議有出席或留到最尾，「其實跟得最足都係戴耀廷，你問返佢啦」。因此趙認為在當時他認知的訊息下，確信戴耀廷發出的是最終協調版本。他並確認，戴有出席所有協調會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;組織者群組成員包括戴耀廷、區諾軒、趙家賢、鍾錦麟及黎敬輝，李運騰續問，趙有否聽過群組有人提出戴發送的文件並不準確？趙表示沒有。黃宇逸問到，但趙不能確定該些文件代表參選人的意見？惟陳慶偉指趙無法回答。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙批戴耀廷夾硬嚟-民動未允辦初選已告知與會者製造壓力&quot;&gt;趙批戴耀廷「夾硬嚟」 民動未允辦初選已告知與會者、製造壓力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃宇逸續展示趙家賢與黎敬輝的WhatsApp對話，趙曾於5月5日提醒黎「特別留意Benny點樣講民動個角色」，並稱「佢（戴耀廷）啲嘢真係成日都亂咁嚟」，在延伸庭的黃之鋒、岑敖暉及袁嘉蔚均發笑，黃之鋒及岑敖暉其後亦大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃問趙為何會對戴有此印象，趙表示過往與戴耀廷在民主運動上的很多溝通、或一些活動的推行令他有此感覺，並指戴邀請民主動力幫忙辦初選時，他回應需要思考、未能夠答應，但戴已在會上向與會者表示「邀請咗民主動力去幫手做個初選啦」。趙批戴「唔講事實嘅後半段」，令很多與會者以為民主動力已經肯幫手和會幫手、亦有此期望，惟趙指，「如果我哋民主動力真係考慮過之後，真係不會幫手嘅話，咁其實就唔單止中晒箭啦，因為期望落差太大，根本無形中已經造咗一個壓力出嚟」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，「變咗好多時佢（戴）想人哋做某啲嘢，但嗰啲人未必應承呢，佢就會用類似嘅方法，叫做夾硬嚟又好，或者順住個勢，結果都係要按佢需要而進行」。法官李運騰問，戴是否製造令人難以拒絕的情況，迫使人接受他想做的事，趙同意，並重申「我直情係採取一個好困擾嘅迴避態度對佢咁解」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱落口供時記錯-澄清無出席第二次新東會議-指首次會議莊榮輝稱不獲民主黨授權&quot;&gt;趙稱落口供時記錯 澄清無出席第二次新東會議 指首次會議莊榮輝稱不獲民主黨授權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃宇逸續就新界東會議情況發問，問趙是否得知民主黨代表莊榮輝，曾在5月5日第二次新東協調會議上，稱不獲授權處理是否同意否決預算案。惟法官指趙沒有出席該次會議，對此沒有個人認知。辯方續展示趙於2022年9月錄取的首份書面供詞，提及他曾出席第二次新東會議，並指鄒家成會上提出「一定要否決財政預算案」以迫使政府回應「五大訴求」，但當時仍未能達成共識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問他是否有出席該次會議，趙指錄取口供時記錯了會議日期，重申就新界東只出席了4月14日的第一次會議，並指首次會議民主黨代表是莊榮輝，而第二次會議獲助手黎敬輝告知，民主黨代表為李永成。趙續指，記得莊榮輝會上曾提及他沒有獲民主黨授權，李運騰問他是在第一次會議、而非第二次會議聽到？趙說「係，冇錯，我親耳聽到，親眼見到」，說時以右手指着自己的右耳和右眼示意，鄒家成發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱戴耀廷主持首次新東會議-區諾軒為協助角色&quot;&gt;趙稱戴耀廷主持首次新東會議 區諾軒為協助角色&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續展示黎敬輝就首次新東會議的重點筆記，提及「程張迎、羅永德、Ben（鍾錦麟）、Benny（戴耀廷）、區諾軒主持」。趙確認當日遲到會議，到場時上述人士坐在主席台位置，並觀察到由戴耀廷主要發言和主持會議，區諾軒作為主持的一部分，但屬「協助」角色。李運騰續問會上有否社民連的代表，趙稱有代表，但不記得是誰，亦確認梁國雄不在場，其後據紀錄確認吳文遠和岑子杰在場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙同意，組織者無就會議點名或作出席紀錄，但戴耀廷曾邀參與者輪流自我介紹，不過他同意有參與者遲到早退。黃宇逸問趙曾否確認黎敬輝的出席者名單是準確，趙指他當晚有出席，記錄上大致也是有出席的人。法官陳仲衡一度指，問證人有否確認出席者身分是「非常愚蠢的問題」，着黃善用時間；李運騰亦指若辯方望指出有不在紀錄的人出席，可直接指出，黃稱留待另一證人才發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎敬輝無記錄否決權用字爭議-趙稱因他已在場聽到着黎不用記&quot;&gt;黎敬輝無記錄否決權用字爭議 趙稱因他已在場聽到着黎不用記&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就否決預算案的討論，趙重申會上有人提及支持戴耀廷在《蘋果日報》文章的看法，戴遂以「好溫和」字眼講解，會上並就「會運用」和「會積極運用」字眼討論。趙形容，「呢方面係有少少嘅火花衝突喺度，因為鄒家成有提過要『chur盡』，就係我一定會運用（否決權）咁嘅意思」，而林卓廷代表莊榮輝則質疑是否「起學校醫院都反對」。趙並指，在首次會議「我好記得就係冇任何投票」，因民主黨代表表明不獲授權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙同意，黎敬輝的筆記是快速的重點紀錄，若就某些議題有很詳細討論，「當然唔會寫咗落去」，而是會記錄討論後的重點。李運騰續指，趙家賢稱莊榮輝提及不獲授權投票，但黎卻沒有記錄，趙指「因為我當時有同黎敬輝講呢個位唔洗啦，我啱啱聽完啦」，被告席傳來「嘩」，鄒家成亦發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃宇逸其後亦問，若鄒家成倡用「會運用」字眼，黎應會作為要點記下？趙重申當時以電腦處理區議會事務，至戴耀廷講解文章和否決權字眼的討論，他有抬起頭專心聽，爭議完後就向黎表示：「其他開會啲重點你 mark 低啦，咁但就住啱啱嗰個有火花嘅開會嘅情況呢，我都知道晒，咁得啦唔洗 mark 啦」，鄒家成再發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃續問，是否記得社民連代表會上稱不能同意否決預算案，因若有全民退保，社民連會贊成。趙稱只記得社民連代表稱會支持全民退保，但沒有詳細記憶。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;新東會上數度提共同綱領-趙稱無人反對制訂&quot;&gt;新東會上數度提共同綱領 趙稱無人反對制訂&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰其後就黎敬輝紀錄發問，引述吳文遠曾稱「大家可制訂共同綱領」、將軍澳青年力量稱「必須有共同綱領」、戴耀廷亦稱「共同綱領原則是否決預算案，迫政府解散立法會，今次任期可能只有七個月」。趙確認會上有聽到該些說法，並指吳並非用「共同綱領」字眼，而是指「整一份大家一齊同意嘅嘢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰追問戴是否嘗試總結會議內容，趙認為他「有少少係總結咗部分人嘅意思」，並指戴本身有此倡議，而會上亦有人要求運用否決權。李續問，紀錄有至少3處提及「共同綱領」，當時有沒有人反對制訂共同綱領？趙指沒有，僅莊榮輝稱不獲授權處理。他亦同意，會議筆記並非逐字記錄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指戴耀廷曾稱會將所有協議發給參選人-同意港島共識投1票惟協議稱投4票是錯誤&quot;&gt;趙指戴耀廷曾稱會將所有協議發給參選人 同意港島共識投1票惟協議稱投4票是「錯誤」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃宇逸續就港島會議發問。被問趙是否不知道戴有否將「35+港島final」文件私下發給港島參選人，趙表示戴曾向他稱，會將所有文件的草擬和最終版發給參選人和團隊；又指曾問一名男參選人，對方表示收到戴耀廷的文件。黃一度問趙有否問鄭達鴻，並問趙是否不知事實上所有港島參選人都有收到文件，但遭法官陳慶偉打斷並着他「請聰明一些（please be smart）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續同意，於5月底得知港島區由投4票改為投1票，指各區的投票系統均要統一。黃續展示港島協調機制協議，有條款提及「以全票制選出他支持的四張名單」，問是否與港島最後共識不吻合，趙同意，亦同意陳慶偉指，若文件由戴耀廷準備，那戴是出錯（wrong）。惟他同意，無收到任何人向他或組織者提出協議字眼與共識不一致。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指鄭達鴻細心理性審視政策-不肯定是否必定否決預算案&quot;&gt;趙指鄭達鴻細心理性審視政策 不肯定是否必定否決預算案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢昨亦供稱，戴耀廷2020年8月底曾提議為香港民研預留款項研發全民投票系統，進行有關否決預算案的民調，因關注傳統民主派對運用否決權有保留。黃宇逸問到，即直至2020年8月尾，傳統民主派對無差別否決預算案仍未有共識？趙回應指7月底政府宣布押後選舉，「但大家傾嘅嘢冇特別改變」；而戴望建立新系統就否決預算案進行民調，是因他感受到傳統民主派一旦進入立法會，或不如他規劃般否決預算案，而他想整個民主派一起團結否決。趙強調，戴「有一個自己對於嚟緊事態發展的推測及分析」，他亦同意陳慶偉所指，戴是想鞏固（reinforce）自己的計劃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃續問，趙是否不知道鄭達鴻有沒有同意過一旦當選，將無差別否決預算案。趙指鄭在區議會是其同事，大家共事好幾年，「佢審視唔同嘅政府議題政策呢，係會好細心同埋係好理性去討論嘅，所以如果淨係講佢個人嘅話，我係唔能夠知道佢入到去係咪一定會否決財政預算案」。惟法官陳仲衡提到，本案關鍵並非被告會否實際上無差別否決預算案，而是他是否同意參與一個有人會無差別否決預算案的謀劃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱黎敬輝獲賦權代表民主動力&quot;&gt;趙稱黎敬輝獲賦權代表民主動力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，辯方亦就時任民主動力總幹事黎敬輝發問，趙確認其工作性質主要是行政。黃宇逸問，黎敬輝並非「35+」組織者之一？趙稱「依個問題好難」，黃續問黎在會議角色是否僅限於抄筆記，李運騰補充即問黎敬輝是僅在場抄筆記，抑或代表民主動力出席？趙指「多謝法官閣下 rephrase 過條問題」，並指黎除了是「行政首長」，亦獲賦權代表民主動力，只是不能控制人們如何判斷他說話的比重。他並確認，黎大致上沒有參與會上的討論，但有時談及初選的行政工作或經驗而趙家賢不在場時，黎會幫手講解。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/4H8ve3C.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（12日）踏入審訊第41天。趙家賢接受代表吳政亨的大狀盤問，庭上展示新界東群組對話，其中認罪被告、控方證人林景楠曾轉發「三投三不投」的《蘋果日報》頭版廣告，批評廣告「內容很多問題」，以紅色做底色「好嘔心」，又問圖中「藍色物體是否媽咪麵個friend？」，戴耀廷則回應廣告由民間團體刊登，「與初選無直接關係」。趙確認，事前不知悉該廣告，而戴耀廷亦曾向他承諾「三投三不投」與初選大會無關。被問「三投三不投」是否並非「35+計劃」一部分，趙表示：「我只可以回應同民主動力同我本人同區諾軒無關。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙確認吳政亨無出席組織者會議惟不清楚吳有否與戴耀廷討論否決財案&quot;&gt;趙確認吳政亨無出席組織者會議、惟不清楚吳有否與戴耀廷討論否決財案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表鄭達鴻和梁國雄的大狀黃宇逸下午完成盤問趙家賢，續由代表吳政亨的大律師石書銘盤問，其中發起「三投三不投」的吳被指為初選組織者之一。趙確認，吳沒有出席初選組織者會議、記者會及協調會議。被問吳是否從沒參與立會過半後如何使用權力的討論，趙表示「我唔知佢有冇喺其他場合參與，所以我只能夠答唔清楚」。至於吳有否參與否決預算案的討論，趙同樣回答不清楚，重申不知道吳有否在其他場合或與其他人包括戴耀廷討論。趙亦同意，吳政亨並非在任何初選WhatsApp群組內，亦無參與製作初選提名表格，趙就後者稱「係民主動力做嘅，所以佢無參與」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;林景楠曾轉發三投三不投廣告稱內容很多問題-民主動力總幹事覆非35廣告&quot;&gt;林景楠曾轉發「三投三不投」廣告稱「內容很多問題」 民主動力總幹事覆非「35+」廣告&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石書銘其後展示「新界東訊息發佈區」的WhatsApp群組，其中一個訊息來自「M」，他發送2020年7月3日「三投三不投」在《蘋果日報》刊登的頭版廣告，以紅色為底色，上有金剛箍繫着「候選人」字眼，亦有「7月11/12日 民主陣營歷史首次立法會大選初選！」、「立即聯署 約束政棍」等字句。「M」問「這個廣告是大會落的嗎？」，民主動力總幹事黎敬輝回答「不是」，趙確認黎是指這不是「35+計劃」的廣告。石問到「M」是否指林景楠，趙稱不知道，因電話沒有特別記認；主控萬德豪則確認「M」是林景楠。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;林續發訊息稱：「這個廣告的內容很多問題，我建議大會澄清一下。另外，設計上，點解要用紅色做底色，好嘔心，同埋果隻藍色物體是否媽咪麵個 friend？對不起，我真係唔係太接受到這個頭版廣告。」鄒家成聞言捂嘴發笑，吳政亨則微微搖頭，而延伸庭的黃之鋒、馮達浚及袁嘉蔚均大笑。戴則於群組回應指：「這是一個民間團體搞的，與初選無直接關係」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙確認，在廣告刊登前他及民主動力均對此不知悉，民主動力亦無付錢賣廣告，直至林景楠在群組發送時才知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱曾提醒戴三投三不投或違選舉條例-戴承諾與大會無關&quot;&gt;趙稱曾提醒戴「三投三不投」或違選舉條例 戴承諾與大會無關&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡問到，需否申報該廣告的費用，趙稱所有選舉開支、包括廣告開支，無論最後有沒有參與選舉都要申報，並解釋若廣告對候選人有利，該候選人就要按比率承擔費用並申報；而若落廣告者並非獲候選人聘為服務提供者或選舉開支代理人，則以其認知就是違反《選舉（舞弊及非法行為）條例》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，戴曾因2016年「雷動計劃」賣廣告，該廣告對某些候選人有實質利益，但由於戴及其公司並非選舉開支代理人或服務提供者，亦無候選人向選舉事務處作申報，因此廉政公署作出拘捕，據趙的理解最終法庭判罪成。趙同意自己沒有參與在該案中，但指戴當時有相關構思時，「我同佢提過咁樣應該唔係好啱選舉法例嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙重申，與戴耀廷曾談及「李伯盧」，戴稱李伯盧是其粉絲，並指有這些民間團體幫手初選「係好重要」，而趙曾清楚向戴表示，李伯盧的「三投三不投」很大機會抵觸選舉相關法例，但戴稱「2016年雷動計劃都無事啦」，並承諾會提醒吳小心點。戴亦表示，李伯盧是在民間推動初選的民間團體，並向趙承諾，李伯盧的「三投三不投」與民主動力承辦初選的大會無關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙強調民動工作與吳政亨及三投三不投無關&quot;&gt;趙強調民動工作與吳政亨及「三投三不投」無關&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石書銘續問，趙是否不會視吳為「35+計劃」的組織者之一？趙稱：「我當然唔知道佢同戴耀廷之後有啲乜嘢嘅溝通」，但趙已經與戴講清楚，民主動力承辦初選時，「我哋做嘅一啲工作係同呢個團體冇關嘅」，而戴亦承諾會繼續與該「粉絲」聯絡，繼續推動初選。石亦問，趙是否不視「三投三不投」為他與戴耀廷和區諾軒籌辦「35+計劃」的一部分？趙略提高聲線表示：「我只可以回應同民主動力同我本人同區諾軒無關」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙同意廣告會令人誤會吳政亨是組織者之一&quot;&gt;趙同意廣告會令人誤會吳政亨是組織者之一&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙昨供稱，吳政亨文章予人印象他有份組織初選，並與區諾軒和戴耀廷談及。石書銘問到他這個印象是否錯誤，陳慶偉質疑不明白其問題，並改問是否任何人閱讀有關廣告後，均會如趙般錯誤認為吳有份組織初選？趙同意，並補充是「用一個 reasonable man 嘅角色」，延伸庭的被告聞後傳來「嘩！」聲。石再指，該印象是錯誤的，因為李伯盧並非初選組織者。法官問他是否指出案情，石確認，惟法官李運騰指趙的答案很清晰，就是李伯盧與「35+」沒有關係，其立場與區諾軒一致。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明早續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, CSIS convened a track 1.5 dialogue of Australian, Indian, and U.S. experts to examine emerging threats and strategic stability in the Indian Ocean region. The discussion included analysts and former practitioners as well as several serving government officials from participating countries. The first session in June convened virtually. The second engagement convened in person in October. The engagements were held under the Chatham House Rule. Discussions revealed several specific areas of concern. Many but not all concerns focused on China. They included the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s conventional military modernization&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s non-transparent conventional and nuclear force changes&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s demonstrated willingness to use force — such as at India’s border with China — to assert its claims&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report summarizes key discussions, findings, and recommendations stemming from the dialogues. Unless otherwise identified, all quotations used in this document were from dialogue participants. They are uncredited here to respect the dialogue ground rule for non-attribution under the Chatham House Rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary-of-findings&quot;&gt;Summary of Findings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Regional security dynamics are changing quickly.&lt;/em&gt; The most important observation from the discussion is that security dynamics in the Indo-Pacific (both the Western Pacific and the Indian Ocean region) are changing quickly. The changes are in large part driven by China’s long-term investments in a more capable military, assertive diplomacy, and interdependent trade relationships. China’s unwillingness to participate in existing mechanisms to reduce risk of nuclear conflict or exchange, as well as its lack of interest in engaging in bilateral discussions on arms control, leave few meaningful opportunities for dialogue on conflict risk or conflict avoidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Close alignment of leaders.&lt;/em&gt; Growing concern about deteriorating regional stability and China’s role are driving close alignment among many regional leaders. Few have a closer alignment than the United States, Australia, India, and Japan. The four countries, collectively referred to as “the Quad,” have convened several times at the president and prime minister level over the past three years to build a positive agenda for peace and security in the Indo-Pacific region. Three Quad countries were represented in this dialogue. Aligned views among the leaders include concerns about China’s activities and approach, the international order, and China’s use of economic, diplomatic, or military power to force changes in the global system. However, close alignment is not driving sufficient bureaucratic change in the three countries. Achieving shared regional stability goals for the United States, Australia, and India will require carefully managing relationships among them, particularly given the differences between India’s approach to Russia compared with that of the United States and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Importance of industrial capacity.&lt;/em&gt; The fighting in Ukraine demonstrates the importance of industrial capacity to produce both “smart” and “dumb” weapons in great quantities to sustain a conflict between large militaries. This point is key for logistics and resupply efforts given the vast distances in the Indo-Pacific. Ukraine’s effective response to Russia’s invasion in early 2022, in contrast to its performance in the 2014 conflict, underscores the strategic importance of being prepared before a conflict begins, rather than waiting for the start of a conflict to initiate preparation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need for greater cooperation on technological development.&lt;/strong&gt; Technology will be a necessary, but not a deciding, factor in future military confrontations. “No one technology, on its own, is likely to be a game changer.” Instead, technologies would be most impactful “in novel combination, or with novel concepts of operation.” Developing new technologies and quickly converting them to capabilities with partners will be an important determinant of future success. Relatedly, institutional capacity to be a “fast follower” will be a necessary competency, as no country will dominate the overall sphere of technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concerns about nuclear weapons and deterrence.&lt;/strong&gt; Russia threatened to use nuclear weapons, including battlefield nuclear weapons, in Ukraine. Russia’s threats were met with mixed response from the United States and France. The U.S. response, a clear articulation that nuclear weapons employment is unacceptable, contrasts with the statement by French president Macron, that France would not employ nuclear weapons in response to a nuclear attack against a non-ally. Discussion highlighted that, rather than reassuring a nuclear weapon state that it is not under nuclear threat, narrow responses like France’s may embolden leaders creating an opening where they judge nuclear employment to be worth the risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, participants noted that China’s growing nuclear arsenal may cause it to reevaluate its current “no first use” nuclear policy. Changes to China’s nuclear doctrine could precipitate numerous defense decisions throughout the region regarding forces, posture, and investments driving toward a potential escalation spiral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;analysis&quot;&gt;Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the two dialogue sessions in June (virtually) and October (in person), participants covered critical areas on a range of topics. This section attempts to summarize those rich discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;alignment-between-leaders&quot;&gt;Alignment between Leaders&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Alignment between the leaders is closer than it has ever been.” Participants noted the importance of this alignment in pushing forward on key initiatives bilaterally, trilaterally, and within the Quad. The closeness of views has permeated several layers into government leaders, including ministers and their deputies. However, it has not reached the necessary “14 layers down” into the bureaucracies to convert high-level alignment to rapid execution of new initiatives. The quote describes the challenges that policymakers can face where shifts in policy — especially those that require changes in process or regulations — can sometimes be slow to occur. The result is that progress is slower than the expansive visions leaders have committed to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;areas-of-agreement&quot;&gt;Areas of Agreement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Leaders are aligned on the type of threat China poses: that it seeks to “become a regional, if not a global, hegemon” in ways that undermine the interests of the United States, Australia, and India.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All three participating countries view with concern China’s expansion and modernization of its conventional and nuclear forces. China’s willingness to use its forces to coerce or confront its neighbors heightens these worries. Though not unanimous, concerns were high regarding the risk of Chinese military activity to coerce Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Senior leader alignment on the threat China poses has yet to galvanize action across the three countries’ governments. One participant put it succinctly, “Security is bringing us together, the hard edge of security. We need to couple that with cooperation on critical technology and the need to compete.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;India is taking a different diplomatic and strategic approach to Russia than the United States and Australia. India’s continued engagement with Russia for energy, in particular, remains a complicating factor in the relationship among the three countries. Dialogue highlighted that, so far, all three countries have successfully worked through differing approaches to the ongoing war in Ukraine, but noted that without careful management and consideration from all sides, this issue creates a risk of impeding ongoing cooperation among them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;concerns-about-china&quot;&gt;Concerns about China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants began the discussion noting the degree to which their respective countries are concerned about China’s conventional military modernization, the modernization and expansion of China’s nuclear forces, and the lack of transparency surrounding them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;areas-of-agreement-1&quot;&gt;Areas of Agreement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s policies and actions — both civilian and military — are reshaping the security environment in the Indo-Pacific region. China is seen as pursuing disruptive efforts including its military modernization and employment; its aim to dominate all aspects of critical technologies; its nuclear modernization and expansion; and its willingness to use force to coerce neighbors on border issues.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Individually, these changes could be seen as typical pursuits for a rising power. However, the compounding effect of China seeking all simultaneously was seen by participants as ominous for regional security. One participant observed, “China’s effort can only be assumed to be regional, if not global, hegemony.” Participants agreed that their countries would view such an outcome as counter to their interests.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Participants viewed China’s nuclear force expansion and modernization as detrimental to regional stability. “The absence of meaningful explanation or dialogue” about China’s expansion and modernization of its conventional and nuclear forces is worrisome and further detracts from stability in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Participants noted the importance of preparing to deter — or succeed in — a conflict should China initiate one. This included developing adequate land, sea, and air forces; effective capabilities in space, cyber, and other emerging domains; and the necessary cooperative agreements and arrangements among the three countries and other like-minded states to achieve desired effects.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;areas-of-difference&quot;&gt;Areas of Difference&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China poses a threat to current regional stability. However, the three countries do not always classify this threat the same — as one Indian participant noted, “The United States and Australia are focused on Taiwan, not watching closely India’s main concern: its northern border. The countries have different priorities.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Indian participants noted the dual nature of needing to defend its northern border and advance maritime capability to create sufficient defensive capability in the Indian Ocean, which is “India’s only maritime boundary.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Australian participants’ greatest concerns focused on China’s economic and political coercion and interference within Australia. They expressed confidence that China’s coercive efforts against Australia have been successfully rebuffed and can serve as a model for other countries that might find themselves on the receiving end of a PRC coercion campaign. A secondary concern for Australian participants — though related to the primary defense concern — was a scenario where China used force against Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, Australian participants highlighted a long-standing debate about Australia’s defense capability: whether it should be used solely to defend Australia’s borders or to protect its interests beyond Australia’s borders. The latter case creates a greater priority for long-range strike capability. In all cases, Australian participants noted that Australia would uphold its alliance commitment to the United States, but that the specifics of that support could range from access to bases in Australia for operations up to combined military operations in the Western Pacific or Indian Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;U.S. participants were most concerned with a potential PRC action against Taiwan, primarily invasion, secondarily blockade, and thirdly the potential for a more forceful gray zone campaign to destabilize Taiwan. In each of those cases, U.S. participants noted the challenges the United States would face in making a prompt political decision, then converting that decision into appropriate diplomatic, economic, and military responses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Participants engaged in an exchange about the implications of the China-India border standoffs. One U.S. participant said that Washington sees “China’s border clashes as a strategic success because it reoriented India away from its pursuit of becoming a regional maritime power.” This assessment seemed to surprise — and run counter to — Australian perceptions of the standoff as a defeat for China as it showed itself as an aggressor to the region. Indian participants added that Prime Minister Modi indicated the Indian Navy will have the resources it needs for modernization.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;other-key-takeaways&quot;&gt;Other Key Takeaways&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The three countries — and other like-minded countries such as Japan — can engage in different responses that meet national objectives while contributing to collective security. Potential examples of such activities include closer collaboration on military cooperation, exercises, logistics, and access; closer efforts on priority areas for research and development, and production; and identifying ways to adapt bureaucratic processes in ways that recognize that time is no longer an abundant resource.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;India faces a combined maritime and land border challenge; Australia a political, economic, and distant security challenge; and the United States an economic competitor with a high likelihood of attempting to change the regional status quo and undermine fundamental U.S. interests using force.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One participant assessed that “China is in turmoil. Its economy and supply chains are under stress. Its employment system is not working. Its financial and construction sectors appear to be fragile, and people’s savings are at risk if the previous elements continue to show cracks.” If this assessment is correct, and to the extent China’s current fragility continues or grows, it could raise an opportunity for like-minded countries to allow China’s own political decisions to impede its further growth.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;technology-is-necessary-but-is-not-a-solution-by-itself&quot;&gt;Technology Is Necessary but Is Not a Solution by Itself&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;areas-of-agreement-2&quot;&gt;Areas of Agreement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Discussions touched several times on the importance of developing and utilizing technology effectively. This included, primarily, technology’s importance in economic competitiveness, and secondarily its importance for military purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Participants described several overall trends in technology that impact almost every country (not just those in the dialogue):&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The pace of technology development and innovation is outstripping governments’ ability to either understand or regulate technology.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Technology development is, in nearly all fields, led by the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Governments and militaries are inept at identifying private sector technology and incorporating it into their systems.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Governments’ inability to understand or anticipate technology also limits their capacity to develop international normative regimes that meaningfully impact the trajectory of technology development.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;China may be an exception to these observations as its pursuit of civil-military fusion deliberately blurs the lines between private sector and military and may allow it to both pursue militarily relevant technology and incorporate it more quickly — though the last point is acknowledged as speculative.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each country in the dialogue maintains its own roster of priority technology areas. Those lists overlap in several major areas: underwater technology, both crewed and uncrewed; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance technology; artificial intelligence; hypersonic weapons and hypersonic weapon defense; space, including defense of and reconstitution; and, over the longer term, directed energy and a range of quantum technologies. Many of these technological areas are militarily or commercially sensitive, making cooperation more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Participants seemed to agree that technology would be a necessary, but not determining, factor in future military confrontations. One participant noted, “No one technology, on its own, is likely to be a game changer.” Instead, technologies would be most impactful “in novel combination, or with novel concepts of operation.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even with expressed doubt about the limitation of specific technologies on the future of conflict, participants were keen to increase cooperation between the three countries on development of technology and capability. Implicit in this approach is that more technologically advanced economies would be more successful and by extension have a greater economic (and technological) base to support military development.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Concerns among participants on the needed urgency of modernization also led to discussion that “delivering at speed is what matters.” Successful technology cooperation, one expert suggested, should work on “components before systems, systems before capabilities.” Several comments emphasized the objective of starting small so countries could “work out patterns of cooperation” before attempting more complex endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overclassification of information (as distinct from intelligence) limits faster progress on a range of technology and production efforts. Discussions noted that within the U.S. government, the default seems to be marking a document with a no foreign (or NOFORN) handling instruction. For those working within the government, it is the safest because it is the most restrictive. However, those restrictions greatly inhibit future cooperation as it is time consuming to change information from NOFORN to a releasable (“REL”) state.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Discussions also highlighted the value of not only being the first to a technology, but, in an increasingly competitive world, developing the institutional capability to be a “fast follower.” This entails learning from others’ successes and rapidly adopting — or surpassing — the original discoverer. One participant noted that the PLA is “focused on innovating and scaling as a fast follower,” implying its goal was to rapidly incorporate technology developed by others into its operations, rather than develop its own.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;areas-of-difference-1&quot;&gt;Areas of Difference&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Indian participants emphasized the importance of technology transfers to India so it can increase its domestic military capability production while simultaneously modernizing its military. Indian participants emphasized that India believed technology transfer should happen with minimal preconditions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Australian participants emphasized a range of concerns regarding tech cooperation — and the restrictions on it — that inhibit Australia’s national efforts to remain interoperable with U.S. forces while satisfying its defense matériel requirements. Such issues include Australia’s efforts to acquire or build production facilities for precision-guided munitions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both Indian and Australian participants pointed out the difficulties in working through U.S. regulatory processes, such as the International Trafficking in Arms Regulations. Even successful processes can require an 18-month review. Cooperating “at speed” will necessitate faster processes, possibly based on a “presumption of approval rather than a presumption of denial.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An area of marked difference was an exchange about continued Indian reliance on advanced Russian equipment, such as its S-400 missile system, and U.S. and Australian concerns that those systems could pose a security risk to U.S. or Australian systems. Discussion considered two specific concerns: first, that sensitive technical information would be exposed through system interaction (sensors or communications data), and second, that Russian contractors operating Russian systems near U.S.- or Australian-originated equipment could collect intelligence that would diminish the U.S. or Australian advantage. Indian participants recalled India’s successful history of maintaining security of foreign-acquired systems and doubted U.S. or Australian concerns would be realized.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;implications-of-technology-discussion&quot;&gt;Implications of Technology Discussion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Discussion focused on the importance of developing and adopting technology rapidly to deter and prevail in future conflict. Current development capabilities in the United States, Australia, and India fall short of this goal.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Concerns about the plausibility of tech transfer, as well as risks that efforts will be cut short due to export restrictions applied partway through the effort, limit more robust cooperation on technology development among the three countries. These issues will have to be mitigated, if not resolved, to begin cooperating at the pace and scale necessary to achieve leaders’ goals.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;U.S. participants voiced concerns that requests for technology transfers often originate from partner governments to the United States. The U.S. government, however, “cannot direct companies to share their technology or set up business.” Additionally, one U.S. participant shared their frustration that even when the United States fast-tracks approval for capabilities requested by India, India sometimes chooses another bidder for the capability, creating questions within the United States as to whether the effort to fast-track a decision is worthwhile given other competing global priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;great-power-conflict-will-require-greater-industrial-capacity&quot;&gt;Great Power Conflict Will Require Greater Industrial Capacity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;discussion&quot;&gt;Discussion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine demonstrates that militaries in future wars will need to draw on significant stocks of precision-guided munitions. Close fighting will require enormous quantities of traditional munitions, including artillery and small arms ammunition.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Against this assessment, U.S. and Australian participants noted that their countries lacked adequate production facilities to create “magazine depth” as well as insufficient industrial capacity to ramp up production of those capabilities once a conflict began.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to one comment early in the discussions, future war will be a “massive expenditure of munitions, production, and resupply” based on current industrial manufacturing capacity. “We just don’t have that [capacity].” Efforts to address that manufacturing shortfall are beginning in the United States and Australia, but do not seem to be happening at sufficient scope or pace to meet potential conflict timelines.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recent unclassified wargaming by CSIS suggests that the United States could run out of precision munitions in the first week or two of a major conflict. One participant suggested that in certain stocks, the United States might “run out in less than a week.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;India’s assessment was mixed, claiming it retained substantial capacity to produce “basic” equipment such as ammunition and tanks. Indian participants noted India’s limitation in production such as precision-guided munitions or advanced air capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Participants agreed that their countries’ governments continue to engage in exercises of peacetime bureaucratic complacency regarding technology control, technology transfer, and company-to-company partnerships. Yet, the time to reverse those trends is now if they are to meet expected future needs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States, Australia, and India are working to expand domestic production of such munitions and include efforts to create surge capacity. However, “precision-guided munitions take 18 months, in some cases, to produce.” The consequence is that waiting for the onset of conflict to activate contingency production makes those plans too late.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Creating additional standing production is both expensive and potentially provocative. Thus, efforts to deter through developing (and demonstrating) sufficient production capacity to meet a current or future threat will require risk acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;changing-nuclear-norms&quot;&gt;Changing Nuclear Norms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;discussion-1&quot;&gt;Discussion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s nuclear force is a growing concern as it expands and modernizes. China is pursuing new warheads and delivery systems absent an articulation of what changes in its security environment are driving such significant investment, and without dialogue with regional states about their concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One participant noted that China is “shifting from a small to a medium nuclear power.” Further, its expanded and more capable nuclear force may lead China to, at a minimum, assess a shift in its nuclear “no first use” policy. It could, for example, move to a “launch on warning or launch on attack posture.” While that could be “undertaken as an operational shift without a rhetorical change,” either could be destabilizing to the region and precipitate several defense posture shifts from neighboring states concerned that China may threaten them with such weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Deterrence is being tested, as Russia stares defeat in the face. Will it use nuclear weapons?” Participants agreed that Russia’s threats to use nuclear weapons, including tactical nuclear weapons, in Ukraine undermined a clear standard against their use.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ongoing development of dual-capable missiles and tactical nuclear weapons increases the risk that targeted states must respond more rapidly in a crisis, raising the risk of unintentional nuclear escalation or exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These ongoing changes in nuclear force development and discussion of how those forces might be employed suggests “there is an emerging nuclear world order.” However, it is not clear if the emerging order is based on similar principles of transparency or mutual vulnerability as the currently prevailing nuclear order is.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;implications-of-nuclear-norms-discussion&quot;&gt;Implications of Nuclear Norms Discussion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The discussion surfaced two additional concerns. First, few mechanisms currently exist for engaging in meaningful dialogue on risk reduction from nuclear weapons. Cold War (or post–Cold War) mechanisms are eroding or have lapsed, and none include China. As one participant summarized, “future arms control efforts are only possible with China at the table,” but it is not clear what would bring China to the table.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, retaliatory deterrence is losing credibility. This is based on a combination of at least two factors: one, that national publics are not prepared for the potential of nuclear exchange, and two, that at least one nuclear weapons state has stated it would not use nuclear weapons in response to nuclear weapons used by a third country. These two positions, as judged by discussion participants, may actually “raise the likelihood that such weapons will be used” if the risk of retaliation is not credible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-findings-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Key Findings and Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section presents findings and recommendations focused on the United States and its government, unless otherwise specified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding:&lt;/strong&gt; The high degree of alignment between leaders in all three countries represents an important opening for progress. Close leader alignment is driving adoption of a wider range of high-priority issues between the countries, including through the Quad. Topics include diplomacy, commerce, defense, development, and research and development. Capitalizing on the current window of alignment will require prioritization both within and among these areas to deliver near-term demonstrable wins. Expectations are high in each system for such deliveries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, at present, alignment is not translating into sufficient outcomes from the three countries’ governments. Achieving those outcomes will require transformations from each bureaucracy, though the needed level of change to redirect effectively may prove too uncomfortable, delaying progress and contributing to the belief that cooperation is too difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Leaders at every level in government agencies should prioritize the internal focus necessary to ensure that old habits of internal operation and customary approaches to regulatory procedures no longer inhibit necessary progress to meet the challenge all three countries are facing. This may require explicit instruction to their organizations, updates to regulations (or their interpretation) with clear milestones for delivery, or establishing additional review and approval protocols based on different criteria than the existing processes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Within the United States, to ensure necessary senior-level attention, the National Security Council should convene an Intergovernmental Policy Committee (IPC) process to task and monitor progress on one key initiative from each responsible department. To ensure focus, the president should ask for a progress report at least monthly during his one-on-one meetings with the secretary of state, secretary of commerce, and secretary of defense. The most pressing areas of focus are on reducing delays in cooperation caused by export controls and document classification.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding:&lt;/strong&gt; China’s unexplained nuclear modernization and expansion, Russia’s threats to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine and recent decay in the arms control and monitoring regimes raise the prospect that nuclear threat (and the prospect of use) is being normalized. Further, nuclear weapons states expressing unwillingness to use nuclear weapons in response to nuclear weapons employment lowers the potential consequence of engaging in threats as well as employment for coercive purposes. To reduce the risk of nuclear threat or employment, responsible states must reestablish norms around nuclear weapons, including both offensive and defense employment, as well as the taboo against threatening their use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Reinvigorate public awareness and debate within each of the three countries’ publics — especially in the United States and India — about when, where, and why the state might choose to use nuclear weapons. In the United States, this effort is best led from the White House. The Department of Defense can play a role by articulating current and planned concepts of operation for nuclear force employment, including in defense or in extended deterrence, in speeches and testimony by the secretary of defense and other senior Defense Department leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Develop new channels for dialogue, including with China and with Russia, about respective views of nuclear weapons. These may lead to arms control or limitation discussions, but the current lack of meaningful dialogue on the issue creates greater risk of miscalculation or inadvertent nuclear escalation. New dialogue mechanisms will likely need to find ways to include nuclear weapons states that are not members of the UN Security Council to be effective. India and Pakistan should be included, and dialogue mechanisms should include methods to incorporate other plausible or expected nuclear states should such circumstances arise.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding:&lt;/strong&gt; Limitations on technology transfer, information sharing, and other key elements of capability development severely impede the ability to collaboratively develop, produce, or employ new technologies or capabilities with U.S. allies and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; The Department of Defense, the Department of State, and the Department of Commerce should engage with the business community and one another to better understand the current sticking points delaying a positive response and quickly identify ways to improve the system. The Department of Defense can lead either by driving the process alone or by leveraging an outside organization. The second course may lead to more credible results as contractors will likely be reluctant to directly criticize their customer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Regarding information and intelligence sharing, raise the bar for classifying U.S. documents no foreign (also known as NOFORN) so that it is not the default classification. Identify categories of information that should, as default, be releasable (REL) to specific partners based on criteria such as sensitivity of the topic and confidence in the other country’s information security practices, the cost-benefit of the information shared, and the outcome sought. The Departments of State and Defense should review the impacts of requiring non-delegable three-star-level approval to apply a NOFORN handling instruction on non-intelligence products.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding:&lt;/strong&gt; Technology advances are necessary but not sufficient for fielding effective and modernized capabilities. Doing so requires incorporating emerging technologies with operational concepts, operator abilities and training, institutional support, and the overall capability system. Achieving this on a national basis is difficult. Implementation on a bilateral or multinational basis will be even more difficult. Incorporating emerging technologies and concepts that rely less on “bespoke capabilities, but provide effective, lower-cost options” will be necessary in future capability development. Success will require new forms of engagement internal to each of the three countries’ own processes and acceptance of higher risk tolerance for engaging earlier with allies and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; The Department of Defense, especially the military services, should increase the use of prototyping throughout the development process. Further, it should ensure prototype developers have steady interaction with operators on how, where, and why they would use such a prototype.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Ensure that new research efforts, systems design, prototyping, and experimentation include (when appropriate) allies and partners, to leverage a diverse range of experience and perspectives, and to ensure rapid convertibility of technologies to capabilities that can be used by a wide range of key U.S. partners.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding:&lt;/strong&gt; Australia, India, and the United States remain focused on shared threats, yet have limited mechanisms to coordinate and exchange information in real time for crisis management or response. Such mechanisms will be most effective when developed, exercised, and refined before a crisis starts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Hold a series of tabletop exercises at the track 1.5 or track 2 level that present crisis scenarios and push participants to identify potential gaps in their countries’ capabilities, access, or information that they may need to reach out to partners to secure, or that partners may need to reach out to them for assistance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;趙家賢：選舉延期後戴耀廷未棄否決財案想法 欲建全民投票系統向泛民「施壓」&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;趙家賢稱提名表格寫法「籠統」如「九二共識」 為安撫泛民及抗爭派&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;趙家賢稱上庭前不知「李伯盧」身分 同意其文章予人組織者印象&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/UtxZjkX.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（11日）踏入審訊第40天。時任民主動力召集人趙家賢續作供，稱在組織者宣布退出或休息、立法會選舉延期後，戴耀廷仍有很多「大思想家」的想法進行，曾於2020年8月底至9月初向他稱「過咗風眼位啦，冇事啦而家」、「你睇吓美國國務卿蓬佩奧，都讚我哋初選做得好呀」，並望民主動力捐80至100萬元予香港民意研究所建立全民投票系統，因傳統民主派對否決預算案有顧慮，戴望以民調向他們施壓。趙同意法官指，戴當時仍未放棄否決預算案令政府回應五大訴求的想法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟趙強調，他和民主動力行事一定要合法，絕不想戴計劃的事情「好似變咗民主動力繼續牽連參與落去」，故未有即時回覆，又指「我唔係好敢直接向佢say no」；最終僅回覆可在無指明項目下捐助約40萬予香港民研，惟最終因他和副召集人等被捕，未有動用相關款項。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱戴耀廷擬捐80至100萬予香港民研-建立全民投票系統收集否決預算案意見&quot;&gt;趙稱戴耀廷擬捐80至100萬予香港民研 建立全民投票系統收集否決預算案意見&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢上周談及眾籌資金的去向，提到戴耀廷望民主動力預留80至100萬予香港民意研究所；又同意區諾軒於7月15日宣布退出初選工作後，他因抗爭派記者會「完全失控」而於7月16日宣布退出，同日戴耀廷亦宣布「希望在未來的一段日子，爭取多一些休息時間…當然，我不是甚麼也不再做，我必會與所有認同民主普選的香港人走在一起，在各自的位置，為達成這目標，繼續努力，直至民主普選臨到香港」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢本周主動補充，於2020年8月底9月初與戴耀廷面談，當時立法會選舉已延後、暫不需進行選前民意調查，而戴希望民主動力將80至100萬捐予香港民研，以建立一個收集民間意見的全民投票系統。趙解釋，因當時預計選舉延後一年後會再展開，而戴關注傳統民主派進入議會後會對否決預算案有保留，故望透過新系統了解市民意見，能夠統一屆時民主派的投票行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙擬捐100萬剩餘資金予慈善團體香港民研及民動-惟因被捕終未有動用&quot;&gt;趙擬捐100萬剩餘資金予慈善團體、香港民研及民動 惟因被捕終未有動用&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙指，當時回應戴指民主動力仍在計算35+初選的開支，未有承諾可以捐多少錢予香港民研，並補充該次會面是戴「希望約我去傾」，故趙約他去太古城酒店食早餐，「車位都幫佢安排埋」。趙其後於9月初計算好所有參選人的選舉經費，並將透過眾籌捐予民主動力、超過1,000元、沒有用在35+選舉開支的捐款統合，該筆款項約有100萬。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，他判斷民主動力「有一個責任」為香港民研提供一定數額的金錢進行民意調查，但「絕對唔想戴耀廷所計劃嘅事情，好似變咗民主動力繼續牽連參與落去」，故他向民主動力執委會建議，在該100萬元進行「5:4:1」的分配，50萬捐予《稅務條例》88條註冊的慈善團體、40萬捐予香港民研、10萬留給民主動力作為會務經費。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙指，當時執委會認為50萬予單一慈善組織金額太大，建議增加一兩個慈善組織；並因執委會於2020年12月換屆，故待新一屆執委處理捐助安排。趙續指，他其後向新一屆執委會交待相關情況，他們需時考慮，惟到了2021年1月6日，民主動力的召集人、副召集人鍾錦麟和司庫關尚義皆被捕，故最終該筆款項留在民主動力戶口，並未有動用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱戴望以民調施壓予傳統民主派否決預算案-同意戴直至9月底未放棄用否決權想法&quot;&gt;趙稱戴望以民調施壓予傳統民主派否決預算案 同意戴直至9月底未放棄用否決權想法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡指他們不關心民主動力戶口情況，但問戴耀廷希望研發的投票系統似乎是針對傳統民主派，而非本土抗爭派？趙重申戴的電子民意收集系統「當然個講法就梗係話」要收集不同市民是否同意否決預算案，但戴當時有特別提及望設立該系統，是源於傳統民主派對否決預算案有顧慮，「呢個係我當時收到佢同我講嘅訊息」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問因此戴耀廷直至2020年9月底，仍未放棄透過否決預算案令政府回應五大訴求的想法？趙答：「回應法官閣下，係，冇錯，佢好着重呢個憲制嘅權力」，又指他理解戴是「想攞呢個民意」，若民意支持否決預算案，「會畀到個壓力傳統民主派去服從」，並稱「所以都係因為咁樣，我或者民主動力唔想有款項支持有關系統嘅計劃。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱原簽約撥80萬予香港民研作選前民調-惟因選舉延後無生效&quot;&gt;趙稱原簽約撥80萬予香港民研作選前民調 惟因選舉延後無生效&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙確認控方指，若立法會官方選舉沒有延後，初選後原本會由香港民研進行選前民意調查，讓候選人更能掌握如何配票和決定出選名單，民主動力亦為此預留了約80至100萬，趙解釋因2016年立法會選舉，民主動力以80萬委聘仍在香港大學轄下的香港民研進行選前調查，故有此估算。趙其後確認，民主動力曾就選前民調與香港民研簽約，提及會支付香港民研80萬港元作民調之用，他解釋如立法會選舉如期進行，「嗰份合約應該履行同生效」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續問及，選舉延期後，有否任何就選舉復辦時民意調查的計劃？趙指因當時工作未到該階段，故「戴耀廷冇好仔細去講係點樣做嘅」，但大方向也是如他早前所述。他又補充，當時選前民調是就所有官方選舉候選人進行，「無論民主派定建制派都全部都會做」。李運騰續問，故該民調是為確保民主派能贏取最多議席？趙同意，但補充民調數據公布後，「其實唔同黨派同市民都可以利用有關數據做自己嘅推測研究」。控方其後欲繼續就眾籌資金發問，惟法官陳慶偉指已聽夠相關證據，着控方就另一議題發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷數度問及民動預留民研款項-趙未有回覆我唔係好敢直接向佢say-no&quot;&gt;戴耀廷數度問及民動預留民研款項 趙未有回覆：我唔係好敢直接向佢say no&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方就提名表格等發問後，再返回香港民研的議題。控方引戴耀廷與趙家賢的WhatsApp紀錄，顯示戴在2020年9月10日曾問趙：「知道個數可以用嚟開發個投票系統未？」趙解釋，戴是指上述有關否決預算案的全民投票系統，但他當時「應該未有答」戴。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至10月1日，戴發訊息指「Ben（鍾錦麟）告訴我民動會把錢捐給獨媒下的慈善機構，那筆錢大概會有多少？還有能確實可以給民意研究所的數目嗎？」，並於6日後再指「民意研究所想確知已籌的錢是否已把800K預先預備了作下年選前民調之用」。趙指，當時認知戴想要求民主動力「無論如何總之將80萬左右呢，係可以轉到畀佢畀香港民研，去做一啲後續戴耀廷想做嘅一啲項目」。惟他在法官李運騰指出下同意，上述訊息指的80萬是預留作選前民調，與研發新的投票系統是兩回事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就上述兩個訊息，趙均未有回覆，他指因當時民主動力仍在商討如何處理眾籌資金、捐給什麼慈善機構，他亦有向執委會報告，指「因為我要顧及個風險嘅問題，（民主動力）係唔應該喺後續有任何呢方面嘅嘢有關連嘅工作」，故當時「我唔能夠直接回應到戴耀廷」，「其實我唔係好敢直接向佢say no」。趙續指，當時他是一個「好困擾嘅迴避嘅取態」，重申他與民主動力於7月16日退出，「其實已經好代表到我好關注緊我同民主動力一定要做一啲係合法嘅工作」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱戴退出後仍有好多大思想家想法進行-稱美國國務卿蓬佩奧都讚我哋初選做得好&quot;&gt;趙稱戴退出後仍有好多「大思想家」想法進行 稱「美國國務卿蓬佩奧都讚我哋初選做得好」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟趙家賢指，「我好知道就係，戴耀廷佢係繼續仲係有好多佢呢個『大思想家』嘅諗法喺呢度繼續進行緊」，並指於8月底9月初與他在太古城會面時，「佢其實係有一種態度呢，佢嗰個字眼直程係話：『過咗風眼位啦，冇事啦而家』，而佢仲有講到係話，『你睇吓美國國務卿蓬佩奧，都讚我哋初選做得好呀』」，趙模仿戴耀廷說話時特意提高聲調。林卓廷聞言搖頭，鄒家成望向林露齒笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪問，那趙家賢之後有再回覆戴耀廷嗎？趙續要求瀏覽餘下WhatsApp紀錄，顯示10月8日趙家賢有一個來自戴耀廷的未接來電，戴問「能否與民意研究所會面」，至10月19日戴再問趙「我明天會見鍾庭耀，你能否確認有多少錢可以給 PORI 開發投票系統？」，趙均沒有回覆。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴追問能付多少錢予香港民研-趙稱無特別項目指明可捐數十萬惟不會撥款新項目&quot;&gt;戴追問能付多少錢予香港民研 趙稱無特別項目指明可捐數十萬惟不會撥款新項目&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，在10月19日的訊息後，10月份一個民主派區議會正副主席交流會邀請了戴耀廷出席，當時戴想推動一些「地區法治教育計劃」，他並在會後與他見面說了數句。法官陳慶偉一度質疑是否有需要知道這些詳情，萬德豪指望讓證人完成，趙續指戴當時有追問「究竟比到幾多錢佢協助到香港民意研究所嘅工作」，而趙當時稱應可無條件、在無指明特別項目下捐助3、40萬予香港民研，但強調民主動力並不會就其他新項目對香港民研進行撥款或資助。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示WhatsApp紀錄，顯示黎敬輝於10月20日曾向趙家賢發訊息，稱「大約100萬要捐 還有～56萬為淨收入」，趙重申100萬是所有1,000元以上的眾籌捐款；至於淨收入則是撥歸民主動力經費的收入。萬德豪問是否與35+計劃有關的眾籌收入，趙否認，指黎是匯報民主動力整個財政狀況，56萬應是對民主動力當時項目的捐助淨收入。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱戴耀廷提議外判科大初創企業設投票系統民動曾付160萬予香港民研&quot;&gt;趙稱戴耀廷提議外判科大初創企業設投票系統、民動曾付160萬予香港民研&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢下午確認，民主動力曾就初選投票支付160萬予香港民意研究所，涉民研在初選票站收集數據和相關IT系統的費用，並指戴耀廷曾提議香港民研將投票系統項目外判予香港科技大學一所初創企業，香港民研曾擬備忘錄（MOU）予民主動力簽署，列出所需的服務款項。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢大量whatsapp紀錄呈堂-趙同意whatsapp整體上是可靠&quot;&gt;趙家賢大量WhatsApp紀錄呈堂 趙同意WhatsApp整體上是可靠&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，控方審訊中呈上大量趙家賢的WhatsApp紀錄，法官陳慶偉今問到，趙2020年7及8月在接收WhatsApp訊息上有沒有遇到困難，趙稱「我唔係好明你呢個問題」；陳續改問，他在該時期有否試過不能接收訊息，趙回答：「我唔能夠確認當時有冇任何困難」，因WhatsApp「有時會整Server（伺服器）、有時出問題」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳追問就他個人而言，於2020年1至9月收訊息上有否遇到困難，趙憶述當時不覺得有特別問題出現，反而有些附件相隔太久沒有下載，現在則未能下載。最後趙同意整體來說，WhatsApp系統是可靠。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（11日）踏入審訊第40天。時任民主動力召集人趙家賢續作供，指於初選提名表格加入「支持和認同由戴耀廷及區諾軒主導之協調會議共識」條款，是因傳統民主派和抗爭派對是否簽協議對立很大，而條款寫法「籠統」，是為安撫迎合主張簽署和不簽的兩派，讓他們各有解讀，有如「九二共識」，「一個中國，各自表述」，多名被告發笑。趙又同意，原由戴耀廷和區諾軒決定參選人有否違反計劃共識，以決定是否沒收選舉按金，惟因他已退出初選、立法會選舉亦延期，故民主動力在無考慮有否違共識下將所有按金發還參選人，亦無向參選人確認有否遵守提名表格條款。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢稱各區共識為進行初選投票和否決財政預算案-提名表格列認同協調會議共識&quot;&gt;趙家賢稱各區共識為進行初選投票和否決財政預算案 提名表格列認同協調會議共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;主控萬德豪就提名表格發問，當中第二點條款為「我確認支持和認同由戴耀廷及區諾軒主導之協調會議共識，包括『民主派35+公民投票計劃』及其目標」。控方問「共識」是指什麼，趙未有正面回答，僅強調就該「協調會議共識」，「我有特別講到明係戴耀廷同區諾軒主導，因為並不是由民主動力去主導同進行協調」。萬德豪打斷指是問他該字眼的意思，法官陳慶偉亦指簡而言之即趙不知道？趙續指「因為各個區有啲唔同嘅關係」，故當時用了一個「籠統」的寫法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙同意法官陳慶偉指，他被告知協調會議上達成共識，否則不會加入上述條款，並指是戴耀廷告訴他。趙並指，戴曾向他提及各選區達到共識才可進行初選，「而點樣去運用基本法嗰個權力（否決預算案），就各個區係有一啲唔同嘅寫法」。陳慶偉續問，戴有否告訴他協調會上達到的其他共識？趙指「回憶所及冇」，指主要是否決權的問題，「當然對我嚟講最重要係佢同意初選要做公民投票嘅形式」。趙確認，即會上共識是進行初選投票，及同意否決預算案，只是字眼有不同寫法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱提名表格條款籠統以安撫抗爭及傳統泛民-指如九二共識各自表述&quot;&gt;趙稱提名表格條款「籠統」以安撫抗爭及傳統泛民 指如「九二共識」各自表述&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉續問，「35+公民投票計劃及其目標」是指什麼？趙指「35+公民投票計劃」是指初選這個讓市民參與投票的「活動項目」，重申民主動力是選舉服務提供者。至於「目標」，趙指是望民主派能在立法會取得過半議席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續主動補充，於6月初草擬報名表格，事後戴耀廷於記者會上稱毋須簽署協議，惟之後本土抗爭派三人發起「墨落無悔」聲明，故民主動力加入第二點條款。陳慶偉問，即加入條款是為了安撫（pacify）抗爭派和迎合（accommodate）不願簽聲明的人？趙同意，指條款寫得較「籠統」，是因「墨落無悔」出台後，傳統民主派和本土派「變咗個對立性好大」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉續問，趙家賢或民主動力有特別請參選人留意第二點嗎？趙指記憶中總幹事簽收文件時，「佢回條好似有特別提到呢樣嘢嘅，因為咁樣先至能夠令到本土抗爭派或者傳統民主派都睇到大家用咗呢個條款，我叫做係用佢哋個角度去解讀，叫做『一個中國，各自表述』，『九二共識』嗰種」，鄭達鴻、鄒家成、彭卓棋等多人發笑，陳志全亦邊皺眉邊笑，何啟明一臉驚訝。在延伸庭的黃之鋒則大笑及「O嘴」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉笑着說，「One China policy， 一中各表」，並再向趙澄清，即參選人交表時，總幹事黎敬輝會請他們留意第二點？趙同意，指行政上有這樣做。陳續問，即黎會要求參選人簽署認同第二點？趙指不記得形式，但因參選人參與此「項目」要繳交一萬元按金，「應該收按金時大家有啲文件確認，可能將呢個條款特別提示出嚟」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指總幹事製作按金收據-列明若違共識沒收按金-稱由戴耀廷區諾軒決定誰違共識&quot;&gt;趙指總幹事製作按金收據 列明若違共識沒收按金 稱由戴耀廷區諾軒決定誰違共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續展示民主動力予參選人的選舉按金收據，趙家賢指由民主動力總幹事黎敬輝準備，參選人報名時附上一萬元的按金支票，民主動力就會給予此收據，並指當黎向他匯報時，他才知道有這張收據。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;收據第二項條款同樣提及：「『民主派35+公民投票計劃』候選人必須支持和認同由戴耀廷及區諾軒主導之協調會議共識，包括『民主派35+公民投票計劃』及其目標」。趙家賢同意此條款與提名表格上的條款相同。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於第三項條款列明：「選舉按金將於立法會選舉後全數發還；如候選人違反上述共識，將不予發還」。趙表示，當初答應戴耀廷邀請承辦初選時，戴曾提及民主動力會收選舉按金，若參選人違反條款就要沒收。惟就怎樣才算是違反共識，「呢個並唔係我哋民主動力嘅決定」，而需由會議協調人戴耀廷及區諾軒決定，民動只是執行角色。趙相信黎敬輝因此加上相關條款，並稱忘記是他與戴開會時被黎聽到此說法，還是趙聽到戴說法後向黎交代。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問草擬好提名表格後有否給予戴耀廷或區諾軒審批，趙稱曾將表格放上組織者群組，知道戴曾看過，區亦指「戴耀廷有睇過得啦」；至於收據則沒有放上群組，趙重申因總幹事在使用收據時才告知他，已製作收據方便行政工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱選舉延期後將所有按金發還參選人但無考慮是否違共識-僅呂智恆未取回&quot;&gt;趙稱選舉延期後將所有按金發還參選人但無考慮是否違共識 僅呂智恆未取回&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，民主動力何時將按金發還予參選人？趙表示在2020年9月6至8日，因之前要處理票站的行政開支；並指發還時亦一併安排選舉開支單據予參選人及其團隊申報。李提到，趙早前稱是否發還按金不是由民主動力決定，但這卻發生了？趙解釋，本身戴耀廷邀請他時，計劃並非由民主動力決定是否發還按金；但當政府宣布選舉延期後、加上趙於7月16日宣布退出初選，「我哋民主動力要做返一個服務提供者嘅責任」，將所有資料發還予參選人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙同意，在發還按金前沒有問戴耀廷或區諾軒，指因他已退出初選，他只是「做返本身初選計劃嘅工作」，即處理善後工作。李再問，即他們沒有考慮是否符合第三項條款就發還？趙同意，強調已與民主動力退出之後任何關於35+協調的計劃。李續問，是否所有參選人都有取回按金？趙表示絕大部份人已取回，除了呂智恆，指當時職員多次聯絡呂取回資料及支票不果，最終他沒有取回。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指戴耀廷着民主動力收取參選人夾附共同綱領-強調民動只存放不跟進&quot;&gt;趙指戴耀廷着民主動力收取參選人夾附共同綱領 強調民動只存放不跟進&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪其後問到，有沒有參選人不同意表格上所指的共識？趙表示他及總幹事均沒有收過任何相關提問。萬再展示提名表格，內有予參選人寫政綱的「方格表」，其中施德來在「方格表」附上其名字、個人資料及照片，並在政綱一欄張貼「墨落無悔 堅定抗爭」的單張。趙表示，該表格是模擬官方選舉將相關資料打印予選民的做法，而民主動力無將資料寄予選民，只是吩咐站長張貼在票站予人查閱，與官方選舉做法相同。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙亦同意，有些參選人會自行附上本身不屬提名表格的共同綱領。萬德豪問參選人是否可夾附任何資料？趙表示「正常唔應該係咁處理」，惟當時九東及新西有自行簽署的綱領，作為協調人的戴耀廷及區諾軒都覺得「地區做主導」，作為初選倡議人的戴亦曾在組織者群組及與趙的通話表示，希望民主動力照樣收取該些綱領。趙強調當時已向戴表明，「我哋民主動力只係按戴耀廷嘅要求，接收呢啲文件作存放，唔會作任何跟進」，因為並非民主動力需要收取文件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙認為簽署等於會遵守條款無再向參選人確認&quot;&gt;趙認為簽署等於會遵守條款、無再向參選人確認&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就提名表格的第3至7條，包括聲稱沒有外國居留權、不曾因《立法會條例》被DQ等，趙稱是參考官方選舉表格中合適的部分，並複製在初選提名表格上，強調他們望能選出市民支持的民主派代表參選官方選舉，故須遵守所有相關的條款，尤其第6條「特此聲明擁護《基本法》及效忠香港特別行政區」，趙重申這是民選議員的「應有之義」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰追問，趙複製條款的做法是想確保參選人能夠入閘，但他有沒有確認參選人有否遵守條款，包括擁護《基本法》及效忠香港特別行政區？趙表示與正式選舉做法一樣，簽署就等於確認整個頁面的條款。趙亦表示自己不會問參選人相關問題，「因為喺民主動力同我本人角度會覺得，呢個官方選舉都需要一啲條款守則 ，你簽署得嘅就需要遵守」。法官陳仲衡問到，趙是否知道有參選人曾因違反《立法會條例》而喪失提名資格，趙回答指：「當時唔清楚」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/kT3yquq.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（11日）踏入審訊第40天。發起「三投三不投」、網名「李伯盧」的吳政亨被指為初選組織者之一，趙家賢表示直至逾兩年前上庭才得知「李伯盧」身分，並認為他「講到好支持初選」、「好似係一齊舉辦初選嘅其中一部分」，同意其文章予人印象他是初選組織者之一。趙曾就此問區諾軒及戴耀廷，區指不認識李伯盧，戴則指李是曾協助他雷動計劃的粉絲，認為其組織對民間推動初選很有用。此外，趙認為「三投三不投」籲不投給不服從初選的參選人或違《選舉（舞弊及非法行為）條例》，但戴回應：「點會咁容易有問題呀，嗰時雷動計劃，我哋賣廣告都冇嘢呀！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱直至前年上庭才知道吳政亨是李伯盧&quot;&gt;趙稱直至前年上庭才知道吳政亨是「李伯盧」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;主控萬德豪下午就發起「三投三不投」、被指為初選組織者的吳政亨發問。在主問下，趙家賢表示知道「李伯盧」（吳政亨網名），並指在李於 Facebook 專頁發表政見時首次認知該名字。趙指在初選前無接觸過李，僅從戴耀廷、一些政界人士和傳媒報導聽聞他，直至2021年3月1日就本案首上庭才知道吳政亨就是「李伯盧」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱組織者終要求落選者承諾服從參選機制及支援35-包括不參選及支持勝選者&quot;&gt;趙稱組織者終要求落選者承諾服從參選機制及支援「35+」 包括不參選及支持勝選者&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「李伯盧」發起的「三投三不投」，呼籲在初選和官方選舉投票，並投給初選勝出者；及不投票予「不支持、不參與及不服從」初選的參選人。萬德豪續問，初選原本想法是否要初選落選者支持勝選者？趙表示，以往傳統民主派初選也有討論，有政黨組織同意該做法；但亦有組織認為落選後既已不會參選，是否支持勝選者應視乎情況而定，如有否被勝選者邀請等，亦有人擔心若為勝選者助選，「冇咁鐵票」的支持者會因此流失並轉移。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡一度指是問及2020年的情況，趙指「知道法官閣下，我盡快會講我嘅想法」，續指因此至2020年戴耀廷提出「35+計劃」，亦沒有指明落選者一定要支持勝選者，因落選者已承諾不參與正式選舉和已作「取捨」，票源已更集中不會被分薄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪追問，趙是否知道李伯盧對此的意見？惟代表吳的大律師石書銘即提出反對，法官陳慶偉不批准繼續發問。萬續改問組織者最終的看法，趙表示最終落選者須服從初選機制、不參與選舉，亦要承諾用其方法支援整個「35+計劃」，包括支持勝選者參加官方選舉。法官陳仲衡問是否即等於選舉按金收據上列明的條款？趙指大致上是，亦同意這是發還按金的條件，亦同意在各區協議最終版本亦有提及相關條款。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指戴協調會上引述李伯盧說法-指民間亦提出要服從初選機制&quot;&gt;趙指戴協調會上引述李伯盧說法 指民間亦提出要服從初選機制&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到戴耀廷在會議上如何談及李伯盧，趙指起初在協調會議，戴沒有提及落選者一定要支持勝選者，惟在討論過程中，有政黨和組織開始如此表明。趙續指，記得戴會上提及李伯盧時形容他為民間團體人士，並引述稱有民間團體人士希望有初選、亦望有心出選的人可參與初選，並認為候選人已參與機制就應該服從。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙認為，戴耀廷當時欲提出除了政界討論初選機制，民間亦有提出相關想法，特別是要服從初選機制，因此戴提倡落選者須支持勝選者。趙並指其後經討論後，相關條款就被寫在協議文件上。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指李伯盧如成舉辦初選一部分-曾問區諾軒呢條友乜水但獲回覆不認識李&quot;&gt;趙指李伯盧如成「舉辦初選一部分」 曾問區諾軒「呢條友乜水」但獲回覆不認識李&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續問及趙有否聽過「三投三不投」，趙表示聽過並知道是李伯盧提出，當時有政界朋友告知他相關運動，李伯盧曾稱「三投三不投」獲戴耀廷「加持」。趙續指他於5月底至6月中，即民主動力答應承辦初選後，曾與區諾軒就吳政亨和「三投三不投」討論，他當時認為李伯盧「講到佢好支持個初選，個形態變到好似係佢協助緊呢個，舉辦初選嘅一部分」，「我就打問號啦當然係」，此時鄒家成望向吳政亨笑着搖頭，被告席亦傳來「痴線」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表吳政亨的大律師石書銘指法庭傳譯主任有錯，似乎將吳說成是初選組織者的一部分，但趙並無提及吳是組織者之一。法官陳慶偉續問趙，根據吳所發表的文章，會否給予趙印象，吳是組織者之一？趙一度停下思考，陳慶偉指這是很簡單的問題，着趙簡單回答，趙續說「Yes」，這時鄒家成搖頭發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續憶述當時問區諾軒：「喂區軒，呢條友乜水嚟㗎？佢好似係一齊舉辦初選嘅其中一部分咁嘅？」，又問：「係咪你同戴耀廷除咗邀請我同民主動力之外，仲邀請埋佢，係咪有啲安排我唔知道㗎？」。區則回答指他完全不認識也不認知此人，趙逐向區表示「我好擔憂個情況」，鄒家成張開嘴巴發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷指李伯盧是其粉絲曾助雷動計劃-其組織對民間推動初選很有用&quot;&gt;戴耀廷指李伯盧是其粉絲曾助雷動計劃 其組織對民間推動初選很有用&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢之後再問戴耀廷有否聯絡過李伯盧，並問及「佢究竟係咩角色、咩身分嚟㗎，點解好似變咗係初選嘅其中一個舉辦方咁樣？」，戴表示李伯盧是其「fans（粉絲）」，曾幫忙他舉辦的「雷動計劃」，戴認為該些組織對在民間推動初選很有用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟趙向戴表示，「35+計劃」是民間初選，望集中票源在出選名單上以免浪費選票，而參選人須遵守機制，若落敗就自願地不參與官方選舉。趙強調這是出於參選人的自願態度，因根據香港的選舉條例，任何人都有自由參與或不參與選舉。這時延伸庭的岑敖暉微笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙認為三投三不投阻礙參選人會違選舉條例-戴雷動計劃賣廣告都冇嘢&quot;&gt;趙認為「三投三不投」阻礙參選人會違選舉條例 戴：雷動計劃賣廣告都冇嘢&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而對李伯盧提出的「三投三不投」，即呼籲在初選和官方選舉投票，並投給初選勝出者；及不投票予「不支持、不參與及不服從」初選的參選人，趙家賢認為「三投」對勝選者是一個「支持嘅動作」，但「三不投」對有機會參選的人而言是一個「阻礙」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪一度指就「三投三不投」的證供已足夠，惟趙稱「主控好快㗎啫」，法官陳慶偉亦指明白趙是想說他反對「三投三不投」，因認為會限制人們參選的自由，趙指「冇錯嘅法官閣下」，重申這樣會違反《選舉（舞弊及非法行為）條例》。法官李運騰問及戴耀廷有甚麼回應，趙引述戴當時回答：「點會咁容易有問題呀，嗰時雷動計劃，我哋賣廣告都冇嘢呀！」，並回應聽到趙的關注，指會叫李伯盧在推動時更為小心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明早續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件編號：HCCC69/2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;16人不認罪受審&quot;&gt;16人不認罪受審&lt;/h3&gt;

Key contributors to China’s economic growth over the past two decades will not be repeated: demographic dividends, rising global exports, booming property construction, and unprecedented single-country expansion of credit and debt.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;Local governments laden with debt are increasingly unable to implement Beijing’s policy initiatives. An economic rebound after lifting Covid-related controls on citizens’ movement and activity is already underway this year, but all of the structural headwinds to China’s growth will persist.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deleveraging campaign that China’s leadership launched in 2016 to reduce systemic financial risks is the only logical starting point to explain how China’s structural economic slowdown began. By reducing the growth of the “shadow” or informal banking system, China’s financial authorities cut credit growth in half and made it far more difficult for Beijing to power the economy using its traditional tools of credit-fueled investment by state-owned enterprises and local governments. Over the course of the deleveraging campaign, property developers continued expanding their own borrowing, inflating an unprecedented real estate bubble even larger before it finally burst in late 2021, amplifying China’s current economic distress. The deleveraging campaign marked the end point of China’s unprecedented credit expansion after the global financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the legacy of China’s deleveraging campaign is complex. Had Beijing not taken the forceful steps it did targeting shadow banks starting in 2016, China probably would have faced a financial crisis far earlier, as its system became increasingly difficult to regulate and was already resembling parts of the U.S. financial system ahead of the 2007–2008 global financial crisis. Acting preemptively to control risks in one area of the financial system ended up creating them in another. China had previously used its financial system as a shock absorber for political risks from a slowing economy, rolling over loans and extending credit to unproductive enterprises in order to avoid unemployment and bankruptcies. After the deleveraging campaign cut rates of credit growth almost in half, China’s financial system can no longer play this role, and more credit risks and political consequences are now materializing within the economy, from banks to property developers and local governments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report aims to objectively and comprehensively analyze the economic and political consequences of China’s deleveraging campaign, which are closely related to China’s current economic slowdown. The deleveraging campaign is an important test case of the adaptability and flexibility of the Chinese state to respond to meaningful economic challenges, such as the growth of the shadow banking system. The campaign reflected a series of monetary and regulatory policy choices, where Beijing was forced to calibrate its response to avoid creating unexpected shocks to the financial system, while still reducing systemic risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the internal politics of China’s deleveraging campaign shifted over time, particularly as political power became more centralized under Xi Jinping in the late 2010s. The deleveraging campaign was successful in some of its objectives because China’s top leaders were narrowly focused on reducing financial risks, but maintaining a consensus behind this objective became far more difficult as the economy suffered. As tightening monetary policy gave way to new regulations, a consensus-driven approach to policymaking also gave way to a campaign-style system of economic governance, marked by periodic crackdowns against internet platform companies and the for-profit education industry. This year, the Chinese Communist Party took concrete steps to strengthen centralized control of China’s financial system, in what may presage another political campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing faces difficult strategic choices ahead as it confronts the end of the credit and investment-led growth model that has powered China’s economy for the past two decades. Restructuring local government debt and the central-local fiscal relationship are near-term imperatives, along with the need to unlock additional spending power for Chinese households to ensure more sustainable growth. Interest rates will need to fall in order to manage debt levels, creating incentives for capital outflows and corresponding pressures on China’s exchange rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rising risks within China’s economy and financial system also raise new policy questions for the United States in the context of rising systemic competition. Liberalization of China’s financial markets has been a long-held U.S. objective, but China’s limited convergence with global economic practices and norms has elevated political concerns about deeper linkages between China and global markets. The United States has a clear interest in regulating its own markets transparently, including Chinese firms’ participation in those markets, rather than attempting to influence or alter the calculations of risks and returns for investors in China’s financial markets. Beijing has plenty of challenges of its own attracting foreign investment given the headwinds China’s economy is now facing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-fear&quot;&gt;The Fear&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the summer of 2022, China’s economy and its housing market were in free fall. The real estate industry had been overbuilding for years, even as China’s working-age population had peaked around 2013. Property developers under pressure from new regulatory restrictions started to default in large numbers in 2021, led by Evergrande, China’s largest and most indebted home builder. When Evergrande defaulted in late 2021, its debt level was over $300 billion, roughly equal to the gross domestic product (GDP) of Finland. Covid-19 restrictions imposed in early 2022, including the complete lockdown of Shanghai and similar restrictions in multiple cities, put further pressure on property sales as developers’ revenues suddenly plummeted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even amid the flagging economy, Beijing was suddenly confronting a novel problem within its real estate markets: property developers had sold large numbers of apartments before they were actually built. Now those same developers were running out of money, which meant Chinese citizens who had bought homes, often using their life savings as a down payment and incurring additional mortgage debt, were at risk of never seeing them built. Moreover, developers’ financial problems were becoming increasingly apparent to new home buyers. Developers became effectively unable to sell properties after defaulting on their debt, and buyers feared the homes might never be completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2022, many home buyers who were waiting for their homes to be delivered began collectively threatening to stop paying their mortgages as a way to force Beijing to act. This is not uncommon in housing crises, as home buyers whose homes are worth less than the amount borrowed have an incentive to walk away from the debt. The difference in China, however, was that the homes had not even been built before home buyers began threatening to default. Home buyers lost confidence in the entire industry after most developers began relying on preconstruction sales. If Chinese citizens made good on their threats to stop paying, China’s banks would be at risk of trillions of yuan in nonperforming mortgage loans, turning the housing industry crisis into a broader financial threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selling apartments before construction is complete is common practice in many real estate markets. But in most of these markets, there are strict escrow requirements for sales revenues enforced upon developers to prevent exactly the scenario unfolding in China in the summer of 2022. Although escrow requirements existed in China, local governments enforced them very selectively. China was now facing an unprecedented combination of economic and financial threats, plus a crisis of confidence in the value of households’ primary financial assets, which threatened to weaken consumer spending as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, the catalyst of change for real estate developers relying on preconstruction housing sales as a source of revenue was an attempt to reform and stabilize China’s financial system. Starting in 2016, Beijing embarked upon a broader effort to crack down on shadow financing channels using a combination of monetary and regulatory tightening steps, collectively labeled the “deleveraging campaign.” In the property sector specifically, the sudden elimination of shadow financing for developers forced home builders to repay their shadow debt by borrowing from another channel: home buyers. This introduced Ponzi-type financing systems into an industry that over the previous two decades had been one of the most important drivers of China’s economic growth. When credit and sales revenues started to run out in 2021 and 2022, rather than default on shadow lenders, real estate developers risked defaulting on individual homeowners and, in the process, dismantling an industry that represented around one-quarter of China’s economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;pushing-the-system-to-the-brink&quot;&gt;Pushing the System to the Brink&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The seeds of the property market meltdown had been sown almost a decade earlier during one of the first attempts by Chinese authorities to contain growth in the shadow banking sector. Thursday, June 20, 2013, was a frightening day for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), even if only a few people within China’s bureaucracy understood what happened. On that summer day, China’s financial system came to the brink of collapse. China’s central bank, charged with maintaining financial stability, had unintentionally forced the system to an unsustainable point. Interbank short-term money market rates shot up to 20–30 percent, indicating banks were holding onto all available cash and unwilling to lend to other banks, even at very high interest rates. Those prohibitive rates also meant banks were unwilling to lend to companies and households at more conventional rates. Had this money market squeeze continued, China would have risked significant economic contraction and insolvencies by multiple financial institutions. Within weeks, the nation’s remarkable record of sustained economic growth over the previous two decades would have come to a screeching halt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to the property market meltdown, the most severe liquidity squeeze China’s financial system had faced was ironically caused by a genuine effort at reform. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC), China’s central bank, was trying to reduce banks’ reliance upon riskier funding channels, known as wealth management products (WMPs). Because China’s deposit and lending rates were fixed within narrow ranges, banks could not compete for deposits based on offering higher interest rates. WMPs provided a work-around. They allowed investors higher rates of return than official deposit rates for short periods, such as one month or three months. Investors would then typically roll over the products as they matured, attracted by continued higher returns. Banks could attract new funding and expand their lending as well, bypassing regulatory limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problems arose when banks suddenly could not find investors for new products, which meant they needed to repay investors in the maturing WMPs. The PBOC ended up encouraging just such an event by suddenly withholding liquidity from banks during a time when they were looking to the PBOC, their mother bank, for reassurance that conditions would stabilize. Instead, the central bank delivered a warning at a meeting on June 17 that banks needed to rely upon themselves to manage imbalances between their volatile funding sources and riskier assets, rather than wait for help from the PBOC. The message triggered shock waves throughout China’s financial system. Banks immediately cut back on lending to one another, as traders knew many banks were in vulnerable positions and were fearful no assistance would be forthcoming from the mother bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As those decisions quickly cascaded around the banking system, there was very little cash on offer for regular bank business, such as lending to companies and households or trading securities. This caused interbank money market rates to rise sharply. With money market rates suddenly higher than the interest rates banks were offering on WMPs, WMPs became far less attractive to investors, which included banks themselves. Now banks issuing those WMPs had a new problem: their investors wanted their money back, which meant banks needed to borrow aggressively in the money market. But at that point, few banks were willing to lend money at all, and the PBOC appeared unwilling to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result was a massive liquidity crunch on June 20, 2013, as funding became suddenly unavailable throughout the Chinese financial system. Some commentaries compared the event, with some justification, to the collapse of Lehman Brothers in the U.S. financial crisis of 2008. Banks and investors started acting rationally to protect themselves by selling virtually anything that could be sold. The stock market suddenly plummeted by over 10 percent in a day and a half, even though there were administrative limits on how far stocks could actually decline in daily trading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central bank panicked. It first provided emergency liquidity to calm the markets late in the day on June 20. Then, on June 25, with the stock market still declining, it released a statement claiming liquidity would be available and sufficient for regular market operations. Money market rates gradually stabilized in the following days. The crisis was over but at the cost of the PBOC’s credibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the following years, WMP issuance and shadow banking activity expanded rapidly. The market had called the central bank’s bluff. Facing the threat of a self-created liquidity crisis, the PBOC blinked. After the central bank backed down so publicly, traders could be reasonably sure the PBOC would do the same in the future and would provide funding to the market when conditions became truly dire. As a result, banks and traders could afford to take more risks. Shadow banking products, even though they were highly risky and delivered high and unsustainable rates of return to investors, had basically become too big to fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The June 2013 interbank market crisis marked the end of innocence for China’s financial system — China was now playing in the big leagues of global finance, and this type of mismanagement of basic money market conditions was noticed worldwide. Greater risks loomed ahead as the financial system continued to become much larger and more complex. The crisis was China’s first limited attempt at reducing risks within the financial system, and the results showed that the next attempt would need to be much more comprehensive in scope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the PBOC was taken by surprise by these events. How had China’s shadow banking system become so large, so quickly that it suddenly posed a threat to financial stability? If the central bank could not control the system in its early stages of growth in 2013, how could it do so in the future? Fear of financial crisis gripped China’s regulators following the June 2013 interbank market squeeze. The events of that month highlighted the challenge China’s financial authorities would eventually face in attempting to dramatically remake its financial system to avert a much larger crisis. This effort, starting in May 2016, became known as China’s deleveraging campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;why-study-chinas-deleveraging-campaign&quot;&gt;Why Study China’s Deleveraging Campaign?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report analyzes the effects of China’s deleveraging campaign, which was Beijing’s attempt to reduce systemic risk within its financial system, primarily involving policy choices from 2016 to 2019. An in-depth study of this period in China’s history may seem mistargeted and out of date given China’s far more pressing ongoing economic slowdown and property market crisis, which have produced a dramatic downshift in economic growth and significant financial stress in onshore markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the deleveraging campaign is the only natural starting point to understand China’s current economic and financial distress and how financial risks emerged despite genuine efforts to reform China’s system. China’s economic growth over the past two decades has depended heavily upon a set of conditions — rapid credit and investment growth as well as a booming property and land market — that cannot continue in the future. Maintaining the current course of investment-led growth is a dead end and will produce lower rates of economic expansion and continued insolvencies and defaults among companies and banks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changing course from China’s current economic model requires a sharper slowdown in economic growth in the short term in order to catalyze different growth drivers in the medium term, as well as crowding in private capital to finance those sectors. Policymakers in Beijing understand this trade-off, even if the choices are unpalatable. If China engages in more significant structural reforms to its economy, growth must slow significantly in the near term because borrowers who depended upon the financial system to roll over debt and maintain less productive investment must be cut off from new credit. Those sectors of the economy must shrink over time. Only then can the financial system’s resources be redirected toward more productive forms of investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, reforming a financial system and an economy where the state retains an outsized role and influences prices and resource allocation is a complex process. While most available data in China support the argument that private companies invest far more efficiently than state firms, the fact that state firms are guaranteed by central or local governments and face no hard budget constraints means they can maintain access to credit. When overall credit growth slowed, private firms were squeezed while state firms continued to receive loans. Similarly, in general, when interest rates rise in such a semi-reformed system, state firms are insensitive to borrowing costs and can offer financial institutions superior terms relative to private firms. As a result, attempts to reduce systemic risks may produce more short-term risks of defaults and insolvencies and reduce the efficiency of investment in the entire economy. The consequences of reform in a financial system such as China’s are not easy to predict, nor can they easily be placed along an axis between greater market liberalization and greater state control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deleveraging campaign reflects those efforts at structural reform in microcosm and the difficult trade-offs involved. Its successes and failures indicate the possibilities and limits of reform of China’s economy and financial system, as well as Beijing’s ability and capacity to respond to unsustainable trends within its own system and the influence of technocrats on China’s policymaking process. The key question currently facing observers of China’s economy is whether or not Beijing can change course and maintain past rates of economic growth using new drivers despite the headwinds China is currently facing. The deleveraging campaign is interesting as a test case of Chinese policymaking in response to systemic risks that materialized in the mid-2010s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past two years, China’s economy has been rocked by political intervention into economic policymaking, from crackdowns on internet platform companies such as Alibaba to Covid-19-related restrictions on activity to the effective closure of the private education and tutoring industry. The deleveraging campaign provides a window into whether or not technocrats within a one-party state can effectively execute long-term plans in the interest of China’s political leadership and long-term stability. It also can address the question of whether these political interventions are limited exceptions to more effective technocratic management of the economy or part of a longer-term trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the success or failure of China’s deleveraging campaign is central to the future of China’s economy. The core objective of the deleveraging campaign is to reduce risk within the financial system. It is impossible to consider the long-term growth of China’s economy without considering the nature of the financial system that will finance investment and consumption in the future. Similarly, longer-term growth in China depends upon an expansion in productivity, including the efficiency of the financial system in allocating capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s economic growth over the next 5 to 10 years will depend upon how successfully and efficiently the financial system can shift its resources away from property-related lending and local government investment projects toward more productive private sector firms. A country’s potential economic growth is typically measured by estimating or calculating future changes in inputs of labor and capital and the growth of productivity of those inputs, labeled as total factor productivity (TFP). China’s working-age population has been shrinking since around 2013, and urbanization rates are slowing. Therefore, its labor force is likely to continue declining in the future. Capital accumulation using the old model of growth has slowed for some time, as there are declining marginal returns to greater investment in the property sector and local government infrastructure. There is certainly more potential for investment and capital accumulation within China’s economy, but it depends upon a very different pattern of financing from what China has seen so far, with capital shifted to more productive industries. The productivity growth of those inputs, to a large extent, depends upon whether or not the financial system can be reformed and can redirect resources to more efficient and productive uses. Otherwise, China’s economic growth rates will continue to slow over the next decade to 2 percent or below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;competitions-of-systems&quot;&gt;Competitions of Systems&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deleveraging campaign’s success or failure also implicates global perceptions of China’s power and influence. One vision of China after deleveraging involves stable, technocratically oriented leadership capable of solving some of the most pressing challenges facing China’s economy while maintaining high rates of economic growth. This view suggests important advantages to China’s system of political organization with the CCP’s monopoly on political power. It also demonstrates China’s continued international influence and capacity to engage with its allies and aligned partners economically. Finally, this view suggests that challenges to China’s continued rise in global influence will not come from financial stress or the economy overall, given that Beijing effectively countered one of the most significant threats to China’s economic stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An alternative narrative sees Beijing caught in an economic trap of its own making, unable to effectively reform its system or change course. As the deleveraging campaign and the collapse of the shadow banking system produced more and more defaults and credit risk in the financial system, lenders became far more risk averse, and Beijing was unable to control the volume of credit deployed in the economy. The property sector’s rapid decline dramatically weakened overall growth and eroded the wealth of the vast majority of Chinese households, whose primary assets were most often their homes. Moreover, many households owned multiple properties. This view suggests that the costs of China’s rapid pace of expansion over the previous decade were far higher, and that China’s leadership and technocrats could not successfully manage them. In short, economic gravity reasserted itself, and China reverted to the mean of other emerging markets where credit had expanded rapidly. Rather than serve as a model, China’s economic and political system was discredited in the eyes of the world, and China’s international influence correspondingly waned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these are just narratives, of course, within oppositional views concerning the competition of political systems. But much is at stake within the question of how the world perceives China’s technocratic competence and the stability of its economic model overall. The deleveraging campaign is the most meaningful available window into a complex but necessary technocratic decisionmaking process, and assessing the effects of the campaign can help to determine which future is more likely to emerge in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-current-state-of-risks-within-chinas-financial-system&quot;&gt;The Current State of Risks within China’s Financial System&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s financial system is currently under greater stress than ever, primarily because of the adjustment underway within the property market. Property industry–related lending in China totals roughly 73 trillion yuan ($10.7 trillion), including mortgages, loans to developers, and other informal borrowing. So far, most of the losses in the industry’s adjustment have been felt by developers who have defaulted, but this stress will eventually show up within financial institutions as well. Local governments are facing new fiscal pressures as a result of the decline in land sales, and there are growing risks that local government financing vehicles (LGFVs) will default on their publicly traded debt, which has not yet occurred. Ever since the deleveraging campaign launched in 2016, the slowdown in credit growth has exposed different types of borrowers to risks of default. Increasingly, within China’s system, these assets, such as the bonds issued by local state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and LGFVs, are considered “safer.” As the slowdown in credit growth has continued since the deleveraging campaign began to take hold, China’s economic growth has weakened as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examining the deleveraging campaign also provides the most coherent and parsimonious view into China’s ongoing and extended economic slowdown and what will be necessary to reverse it. In 2022, China’s economy grew at only 3 percent officially, but the actual growth rate was probably negative given the disruptions from lockdowns, travel restrictions, and the spread of Covid-19. In early 2023, optimism about the end of Covid-19 restrictions catalyzed anticipation of a much stronger rebound in China’s economy. But the slowdown China is currently facing has been ongoing for over six years and dates from the decline in overall credit growth and the unwinding of an unprecedented expansion in credit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance of credit growth to China’s economic expansion over the past two decades is discussed extensively in the 2018 report Credit and Credibility. From 2007 to 2016, China’s banking system expanded by $24.6 trillion in assets, or around one-third of global GDP, almost quadrupling over just eight years, as bank assets grew by an average of 18.1 percent. Since 2017, overall credit growth has been cut in half, and many borrowers, including state-owned and private sector firms, households, property developers, and local government enterprises, have consequently been unable to access new financing. The net result has been a significant slowdown in economic growth as firms reduce output or default, while household consumption has similarly declined. Previously, the expansion of China’s shadow banking system had provided access to borrowers underserved by the traditional system, but with those channels closing, consumer activity and many types of investment started to fall, significantly reducing China’s economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Financial risks also began to materialize as borrowers unable to refinance their debts created new credit risks in more and more asset classes. The riskiest financing structures, peer-to-peer (P2P) lending networks, started collapsing in 2018, touching off protests from angry investors in several cities. Smaller banks followed, with Baoshang Bank’s default in 2019, the first in over two decades, touching off several additional bank failures. Then, local state-owned firms started defaulting on bonds in larger proportions, with the default of Yongcheng Coal in November 2020 raising the possibility that local governments could actually create new credit risk rather than reduce it. Trust companies that aggregated investments from banks and wealthy individuals and lent to property developers were the next to default in 2020 and 2021, followed by an increasing number of developers. Finally, by 2022, individual home buyers were threatening to default on their mortgages as more developers were unable to complete houses they had sold in advance of construction. Credit risk had started in the riskier periphery of China’s financial system and had moved closer and closer to the center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s deleveraging campaign was the critical policy choice that set these events in motion, even if Beijing clearly did not intend some of these consequences. As a result, the deleveraging campaign is inseparable from China’s current economic slowdown, as well as the rising financial risks that threaten to accelerate the current downturn in credit and investment growth. But the deleveraging campaign also managed to limit different forms of financial risk tied to the funding of the banking system. Controlling shadow banks may have reduced the overall pace of credit growth but also may have moved credit back to more regulated forms, such that Beijing could influence the direction of finance in the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report aims to comprehensively assess China’s deleveraging campaign and its economic and political consequences, especially as they relate to China’s current economic slowdown and the adaptability and flexibility of the Chinese state to respond to meaningful challenges. The campaign reflected a series of policy choices, some involving monetary policy, some involving regulatory issues, and some involving public messaging or guidance. At each step, Beijing was forced to calibrate its response to avoid shocking the financial system as the PBOC had done during the 2013 interbank market crisis. In turn, the report aims to discuss the internal politics of China’s deleveraging campaign and the balance of bureaucratic and political interests that allowed it to develop and continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;plan-of-the-report&quot;&gt;Plan of the Report&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report provides a comprehensive assessment of the economic and political conditions that produced China’s deleveraging campaign and its implications for China’s current economic challenges. Chapter 1 explains the initial concerns facing China’s leaders after the fragility of the financial system was exposed during the June 2013 interbank market crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The economic background of China’s deleveraging campaign, the rapid expansion of China’s shadow banking system, and the corresponding emergence of systemic financial risks are the subject of Chapter 2. The banking system saw an unprecedented single-country credit expansion after the 2007–08 global financial crisis, and the core activities of the system — deposit taking and lending — changed rapidly. Moral hazard was widespread, as most lenders and investors assumed borrowers were guaranteed. This allowed the financial system to expand at unprecedented speed, with most lenders unconcerned about credit risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mechanics of the deleveraging campaign and the policy choices Beijing made to reduce risks within the shadow banking system are covered in Chapter 3. Starting in 2016 with a People’s Daily article from an “authoritative personage,” the campaign transitioned from monetary tightening steps to regulatory tightening measures, as well as controls on local government borrowing. Control over localities not only involved financial regulators but also an effort to promote much tougher fiscal discipline at the local level by the Ministry of Finance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consequences of these measures within China’s financial system are discussed in Chapter 4. Using data from China’s banks and nonbank financial institutions, both individually and system-wide, the report discusses how the funding structures of China’s banks shifted away from WMPs toward more conventional deposits, as well as some of the unintended consequences of that shift. In addition, the chapter covers the changes in the lending activities of Chinese banks and nonbanks and the migration of shadow banking assets back to formal loan books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effects of these financial changes on the broader economy are the subject of Chapter 5, including the slowdown in credit growth and its impact on different types of borrowers, particularly low-income consumers, property developers, and local governments. Investment growth rates slowed significantly as shadow banks contracted, particularly among local governments in China’s interior and northeastern provinces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter 6 analyzes the deleveraging campaign’s effects as they relate to Beijing’s objectives at the outset. The campaign significantly reduced some financial risks on the liabilities side of banks’ balance sheets, as intended, while unintentionally creating meaningful new credit risks on the asset side, slowing the economy significantly. These consequences emerged because Beijing was unaware of the size of the shadow banking system and the potential effects of contracting informal lending channels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concluding chapter, Chapter 7, assesses the implications of the deleveraging campaign for Beijing’s capacity to respond to systemic risks, as well as the importance of technocratic influence within China’s policymaking process. In addition, it discusses the impact of the changes in China’s economy and financial system for China’s international influence, as well as the long-term growth of China’s economy. The report concludes with implications for the United States and other like-minded democratic countries in their relationships to China’s financial system, as well as the implications for global systemic competition between democratic and autocratic political systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-tree-cannot-grow-to-the-sky&quot;&gt;A Tree Cannot Grow to the Sky&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the 2007–08 global financial crisis, China launched a countercyclical stimulus program that catalyzed an unprecedented boom in credit growth. Over the next eight years, through the end of 2016, that credit expansion was larger as a proportion of global GDP (around 32 percent) than any single-country credit boom in at least a century. The stimulus effort, which was generally labeled China’s 4 trillion yuan package, was successful at stabilizing the economy via lending to state-owned enterprises (SOEs), property developers, and newly created local companies labeled as local government financing vehicles (LGFVs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual size of China’s stimulus was much larger than 4 trillion yuan ($588 billion), roughly 13 percent of China’s GDP at the time, because it was generally funded through lending from the banking system, rather than direct fiscal spending by government. Banks were encouraged to lend aggressively, and did so, to all types of borrowers but particularly those that were state-owned or guaranteed. Overall credit growth, measured via total social financing (TSF), skyrocketed by 32 percent in 2009 and a further 24 percent in 2010. Even after the economy had clearly stabilized and inflation picked up in 2011, credit growth barely slowed in China, posting 18 percent growth in 2011 and 19 percent in 2012. By the end of 2012, China’s banking system had more than doubled its total assets in only four years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Financial risks naturally grew given the volume of credit growth deployed in such a short period. But for Beijing, the alternative to continuing credit growth would have been a sharp slowdown in the economy, as borrowers cut off from newly acquired credit would need to reduce output and employment. As a result, China’s leaders were still comfortable with the growing financial risks, as these reduced the political risks of a slowing economy, including rising unemployment. The financial system had served as a shock absorber, channeling resources to enterprises facing losses, in order to maintain output and prevent the types of economic adjustments that occurred in market economies, including defaults and bankruptcies. As a result, China’s overall debt burden and the corresponding financial risks increased, while political risks to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)’s leadership declined. Beijing could have stopped this process earlier, but China’s leadership and many local government officials likely were willing to live with these compromises — for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Wealth management products (WMPs):&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;WMPs are investment products sold mainly by banks to pool money from retail investors. They typically feature short-term maturities (less than a year) and implicit guarantees from the issuer (though new regulations have phased out these guarantees). Most significantly, they offered higher returns compared with deposit rates. Initially, small banks offered these funds at higher rates to compete with larger banks for funding. Regulators viewed WMPs as instruments of reform and more market-oriented liability tools for banks. Later, WMPs became the key source of funding for the shadow banking business and have faced a severe crackdown since the new asset management rules introduced in 2018. Since that time, shadow banking activities have declined sharply. The outstanding balance of banks’ WMPs totaled 29.15 trillion yuan ($4.3 trillion) at the end of June 2022.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Shadow banking:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The broader definition of shadow banking usually refers to financial services similar to those that traditional banks offer but which are provided by nonbank financial institutions outside the regulatory structure of the formal banking system. China’s shadow banking business is unique because a large portion of this finance is still sourced from banks themselves, with banks moving assets on or off their balance sheets in different forms (depending upon regulatory changes). The shadow banking business in China evolved to bypass regulatory restrictions so that banks could continue to lend to property developers and local governments, as well as other restricted borrowers. Later, banks found additional benefits to shadow banking activity, such as expanding leverage, preserving capital, and concealing nonperforming loans (NPLs). A 2020 working paper from China’s Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) generally defines shadow banking to include WMPs, banks’ interbank WMPs, interbank special purpose vehicle (SPV) investments, entrusted loans, trust loans, nonequity public funds, asset management service of brokerages and insurance companies, asset-backed securities, nonequity forms of private equity financing, peer-to-peer (P2P) lending, leasing, lending by microfinance companies, factoring, consumption loans by non-licensed institutions, and debt products issued at local financial exchanges.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs):&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In China, NBFIs are mainly trust firms, brokerages, funds (public and private), insurance companies, finance firms of large SOEs, or other small firms, from leasing to factoring companies.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;P2P platforms pool money from retail investors and then lend to retail investors as consumption loans. Initially, P2P firms provided real benefits in providing financial services to underserved households and helped boost consumption. Later, these businesses featured aggressive competition as platforms raced to offer exorbitantly high interest rates to attract more funds. These rates were so high that they could not be repaid out of existing investments, and many of the platforms were exposed as Ponzi schemes. The number of P2P platforms peaked in 2015 and then declined as the regulatory environment turned unfriendly, until all P2P platforms closed in 2020.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Trust companies:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Two financial institutions have full lending licenses in China: banks and trust firms. These lending licenses have helped trust firms become the largest of the three primary channels for banks to shift money into shadow banking (the other two are brokerages and funds). Even during the early stage of deleveraging, when both brokerages and funds’ shadow banking business lines were shrinking, trust firms were still expanding. Trust companies can also pool money from retail investors by selling trust products. Beijing has provided only 71 trust licenses and has stopped providing new ones. Currently, there are 68 trust firms in operation and 21 trillion yuan ($3.1 trillion) in assets under management, according to data from the China Trustee Association.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Implicit guarantees:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Implicit guarantees refer to the belief that many forms of borrowing in China cannot default, which is rapidly coming into question. Specifically, this refers to guarantees behind Chinese bonds in the interbank market and WMP products for retail investors. In the bond market, the only corporate bonds that have not officially defaulted (outside of quasi-government bonds such as those railways and banks issue) are LGFV bonds, though there have been occasional technical defaults on these bonds). In the WMP market, trust products have defaulted frequently. Although banks’ WMPs have failed to deliver promised returns, they have not defaulted outright yet.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Repo rates:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Repo rates are interest rates on collateralized interbank borrowing among banks and NBFIs within pledged repo transactions of China’s interbank market.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Maturity mismatch:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;This refers to financial institutions pooling money using short-term funding instruments on the liabilities side of the balance sheet in order to purchase long-term assets. The funding instruments must be rolled over continually, generating refinancing risks. Banking regulators have introduced three liquidity indicators to reduce these maturity mismatches by discouraging short-term borrowing.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Negotiable certificates of deposit (NCDs):&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NCDs are a primary source of wholesale funding for banks introduced at the end of 2013. WMPs allow banks to pool money from retail investors, but in the years before internet financing was developed, small banks’ access to retail investors was still limited, even though they could offer high returns. NCDs are different, as they allow a bank, no matter how small, to borrow money from every bank around the country by selling a product backed only by the bank’s creditworthiness (whereas repo borrowing requires collateral). In the early years, NCDs were not included as a proportion of banks’ interbank liabilities, which are limited to one-third of the total. In 2018, this loophole was closed, and tougher regulations were introduced for NCDs in the course of the broader deleveraging campaign.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;enter-shadow-banks&quot;&gt;Enter Shadow Banks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the investment projects that China’s local governments financed following the global financial crisis were not necessarily designed to generate financial returns that could repay the loans. Banks were simply a mechanism to channel credit into the economy more quickly than waiting for large-scale government bond issuance. As a result, banks had a problem in lending to guaranteed borrowers, who still needed more money to continue their investments. Banks had no incentive to cut off these projects because the state implicitly or explicitly guaranteed the loans. Canceling loans would generate immediate fiscal costs, and banks would see their profitability decline because of the need for new provisions against bad debt. But the loans were not technically performing, which could create liquidity problems if banks suddenly faced withdrawal of deposits or other liabilities. These scenarios were exactly what occurred during the June 2013 interbank market crisis (the basic problems that developed within the banking system are discussed in detail in Chapter 2 of Credit and Credibility).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The growth of the shadow banking system emerged as a partial solution to banks’ difficulties maintaining these loans to state-owned and local government borrowers as performing assets, so banks did not need to mark the loans down in value. China controlled the growth of lending through blunt regulatory instruments — including outright quotas for individual banks (these are still used to some extent), ceilings on deposit rates, and floors on lending rates — to guarantee banks a fixed net interest margin and profitability. The deposit rate ceilings were also designed to prevent banks from raising short-term interest rates to attract additional financing, competing with other banks for funding and increasing the overall level of risk in the financial system. Broader loan-to-deposit ratios were imposed around 75 percent for most banks to ensure that funding was sufficient to cover potentially risky lending. Before 2012, these tools were very blunt but generally effective in China’s financial system. In 2009 and 2010, Beijing was eager to expand credit and investment and relaxed lending quotas and guidance to local governments. After the initial postcrisis stimulus, localities were eager to continue borrowing and investing at the same pace, so they created mechanisms to avoid Beijing’s restrictions via shadow banks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banks gradually channeled more and more of their funding into shadow banking channels outside of their formal loan books. Because they could not compete with one another by raising deposit rates, they would channel funds as an investment into a WMP, which would then invest the funds into a third-party financial institution such as a trust company or asset management company. The trust company, unburdened by the same sets of regulations and quotas governing bank loans, could then lend to the final borrower. This effectively moved what was traditionally a straightforward loan into an off-balance-sheet asset, in which the bank holds a claim on the third-party shadow banking institution, or NBFI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shadow banks offered local governments and SOEs a way to keep borrowing and investing to fund ongoing projects even after Beijing stepped in to limit credit growth following the postcrisis stimulus. A shadow bank or NBFI would provide a higher-interest bridge loan to a borrower for a short time, perhaps even less than one month. The bridge loan would be used to repay the older bank loan that needed to be rolled over. Then the bank could extend the borrower a larger new loan based on solid recent credit history. The new loan could be used to repay the shadow bank loan with both principal and interest. And the bank could still mark the loan as performing since the old loan had been repaid in full and a new loan had been granted. Sometimes bank loan officers themselves managed these shadow banks, allowing the officers to profit personally from the rollover process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shadow banking not only facilitated new lending to state-owned borrowers but also allowed banks to circumvent regulations on lending to certain types of borrowers, particularly property developers and LGFVs. As regulators attempted to curtail these practices and created specific limits on trust companies or other lenders, forms of credit quickly evolved to circumvent the regulations. The lending was profitable, and borrowers were willing to pay higher interest rates because they were either cut off from other forms of credit or insensitive to borrowing costs (such as local governments). As a result, shadow banks quickly expanded in an economy that had seen an explosion of credit growth, where politicians, local governments, banks, and borrowers all wanted growth to continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another function of shadow banking was to restructure the form of lending so banks could expand credit and profits by a larger margin, even if they could not expand their capital bases. Regulators applied higher risk weightings and corresponding capital requirements on loans than on short-term claims on other financial institutions, which were considered safer. As a result, banks had incentives to restructure loans as different types of assets, either by hiding them entirely off their balance sheet or by representing them as a different form of credit, such as an “investment receivable” or an “interbank entrusted payment.” The complexity of these systems grew throughout the expansion of the shadow banks. But the overall purpose was simply to maintain credit to preferred borrowers and to continue profitable lines of business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there were new problems that shadow banks created as well. In offering short-term WMPs to retail investors, banks were often competing with one another explicitly via interest rates, which meant they also needed to find borrowers who were willing to pay higher rates. These borrowers were generally property developers who could afford higher borrowing costs because of their high gross margins and local governments who were not sensitive to borrowing costs because they faced no budget constraints. While lending to these sectors was more lucrative, channeling new credit to these areas also meant less credit to the rest of the economy. Developers and local governments’ implicit guarantees essentially made lending to these firms risk-free for several years and lifted the overall borrowing costs of the entire economy. Ultimately, high borrowing costs were one of the most important reasons behind the rise in defaults in recent years. One key goal of deleveraging was to reduce borrowing costs for the entire economy, especially for local governments. Given that LGFVs generate returns on assets of less than 2 percent, they can barely manage a 3 percent interest rate, while many of these firms were actually borrowing at shadow bank interest rates as high as 10 percent. At rates this high, new borrowing from LGFVs is necessary just to service older debts, rather than initiating new investments. Reporting to the National People’s Congress (NPC) in December 2015 after the first year of the local government bond swap program, Finance Minister Lou Jiwei commented that the program helped to reduce localities’ borrowing costs from 10 percent to 3.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the loans that shadow banking institutions made were longer in duration than the WMPs, which were often only one month or three months. But banks issuing WMPs now had a new problem: they needed to keep rolling over this funding, which came from retail investors, corporate depositors, and other banks. Moreover, the financial system as a whole became riskier, as shadow banks were forced to extend loans to borrowers willing to pay higher interest rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;moral-hazard-and-rapid-shadow-banking-growth&quot;&gt;Moral Hazard and Rapid Shadow Banking Growth&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Central to the growth of shadow banking was the widespread moral hazard throughout the financial system. Moral hazard refers to a condition in which decisionmakers or investors either seek out additional risk or avoid managing risk because they believe they are protected from losses. Several factors contributed to the development of moral hazard within China’s financial system, but the most important was Chinese authorities’ continued interventions to stabilize markets in the event of any financial instability or widespread losses. Chapter 6 of Credit and Credibility discusses this phenomenon and the pattern of government intervention in far greater detail. Most Chinese citizens and investors in China’s financial markets understood that the CCP was highly averse to perceived political instability. If financial losses among shadow banking products materialized, they were likely to generate protests and social discontent. Beijing had clearly established a precedent to intervene and minimize financial losses as a mechanism to avoid political dissent. Financial risk thus continued rising as a tool to minimize political risk to the party’s rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state’s outsized role within China’s economy was one of the most important contributors to the perception that virtually all assets within China’s financial system were guaranteed. SOEs face soft budget constraints and often receive subsidies directly from fiscal resources in order to continue operating. Lending to SOEs is therefore seen as entirely safe because the state must support these borrowers regardless of the level of debt they accrue. Banks typically are happy to lend to state-owned borrowers and will do so until they hit lending quotas, as the profitability of such loans is basically guaranteed. Even if the borrower cannot repay its debt, the state will presumably ensure the company’s solvency. Loan officers also face personal incentives for lending to state firms. A loan officer could be personally blamed for losses incurred by lending to private firms, whereas lending to SOEs would be viewed as a job requirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To compound this issue, banks themselves are state owned in China, so borrowing between banks is also perceived to be entirely guaranteed. Even during the interbank market crisis in June 2013, banks stopped lending to the market not because they thought their counterparties would suddenly declare bankruptcy but because they were concerned the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) would not provide enough liquidity in the short term to engage in regular business. These guarantees on banks created incentives for loan officers to transform riskier loans into claims on banks themselves by borrowing or lending to banks using the riskier assets as collateral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can easily see how credit could expand rapidly in a situation in which the state guaranteed both borrowers and lenders. But there are also more fundamental limits to how fast credit and debt can grow relative to the size of China’s economy. As the People’s Daily diagnosed China’s debt problem in May 2016, “A tree cannot grow to the sky.” Figure 2.1 illustrates the key problem with a rapidly rising corporate debt burden, even if it is SOEs that are borrowing: significant quantities of new credit must be used to service older debt, so every yuan of new credit no longer generates the same economic activity as in the past. Cash flows and savings that fund investment are distributed unevenly throughout the economy, but the annual interest on credit, estimated using average quarterly borrowing rates from the PBOC, has exceeded nominal GDP growth every year since 2012. An International Monetary Fund working paper published in early 2018 concerning China’s credit booms notes that in 2007–08, 6.5 trillion yuan ($950 billion) in new credit growth boosted nominal GDP by 5 trillion yuan ($735 billion). In 2015–16, 20 trillion yuan ($2.9 trillion) in credit was needed to create the same marginal GDP growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2012, conditions were set for a rapid expansion of credit, with shadow banks playing an increasingly important role in the process. At first, regulators were loath to crack down on shadow banking activities because both WMPs and lending via NBFIs were viewed as instruments of financial system reform. By competing for funding with banks, many Chinese officials thought WMPs played a role in interest rate liberalization, which was a long-held goal of financial reformers. Furthermore, riskier lenders such as P2P networks were playing an important role in expanding access to financial services to lower-income households and small private businesses that had previously been cut off from the state-owned banking system. There were many reasons for Chinese authorities to tread cautiously in regulating these institutions, which also allowed them to grow quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 2012 to 2016, informal or nonbank lending expanded by at least 36.7 trillion yuan ($5.3 trillion), representing around 31 percent of total credit extended over those five years (the shadow lending components are represented by the dark blue area of Figure 2.2). Much of this was borrowed by property developers, local governments, and speculators and ended up fueling a number of asset bubbles in property, stocks, and commodities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/mz24Bzt.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shadow banks significantly complicated the traditional operations of China’s financial system. In order to generate additional returns and repay investors at higher interest rates, lenders had to take additional risks in extending loans to borrowers that were not guaranteed. The fact that the state-guaranteed banks meant they felt comfortable guaranteeing WMPs offered to their customers, even if those WMPs were making very risky loans to borrowers that could default. The assumption was that the banks themselves would simply pay the losses from risky loans out of their own funds and continue to provide their customers with high rates of return. Otherwise, the investor could shift to another bank. In turn, trust companies, asset management companies, and other NBFIs felt comfortable lending to local governments and LGFVs at high rates because the NBFIs often boasted some degree of state ownership as well, usually by local governments. The assumption of widespread government guarantees on both borrowers and lenders led to a significant expansion of system-wide financial risks, as shadow banks started to become almost one-third of overall lending from 2012 to 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-great-ball-of-money&quot;&gt;The Great Ball of Money&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aftermath of the interbank market crisis in June 2013 set the stage for a wave of bubbles in China’s financial and asset markets. Even as the banking system came to the brink of collapse in 2013, investors, depositors, and bankers essentially called the PBOC’s bluff, as the dramatic sell-off forced the PBOC to inject sizable amounts of liquidity and calm the money markets. Rather than a “flight to quality” in which investors sought out safe assets, the rise in interest rates encouraged investors to engage in a “flight to risk,” sinking funds into higher-interest WMPs, knowing the banks issuing them would need to guarantee their returns. In order to prevent the crisis from repeating itself later, the PBOC needed to manage short-term interbank market rates far more carefully to avoid spikes that might trigger additional redemptions of WMPs and a spiral in short-term rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many internet finance companies that became dominant in China over the next decade, such as Alibaba and Tencent, started in this field during the aftermath of the June 2013 interbank market crisis. They offered their customers high returns and encouraged depositors to shift funds from banks to internet-based funds simply by reinvesting the funds raised on their platforms in the interbank market at even higher rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These conditions were conducive to a wave of financial speculation, indirectly encouraged by the PBOC. By intervening regularly to keep money market rates low and stable, the central bank encouraged shadow banks not only to borrow aggressively in the money markets at low rates but also to add leverage to their positions in order to generate yield. Soon, virtually anything that could generate yield in China’s financial system was seeing an influx of money channeled from banks via WMPs into third-party lenders. NBFIs became the largest borrowers within China’s money markets, larger than even city or rural commercial banks (Figure 2.3). This surplus liquidity was often labeled China’s “great ball of money,” rocketing from one speculative market to the next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/89khrji.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2.3: Borrowers and Lenders in Pledged Repo Market, Total Turnover, 2013–2016.&lt;/strong&gt; Note: Borrowing reflected in positive totals, lending in negative totals. Source: PBOC quarterly monetary policy reports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first obvious source of speculative activity in 2012 was the property market. China’s property market was the largest individual asset market in the country, and there were powerful forces motivating speculation in housing. Prices had risen dramatically ever since the liberalization of the housing market in the late 1990s. The few setbacks in 2008 and 2011 were only six to nine months in duration, usually viewed as an opportunity to pile back into the sector. Developers were able to borrow liberally from shadow banks, bypassing limits on borrowing for land purchases. As a result, land prices continued rising, with developers then pushing up housing costs to maintain margins. Most investors thought that the sector was simply “too big to fail,” given the importance of property to China’s overall economic growth and localities’ reliance upon land sales revenues. The symbiotic relationship between developers and localities encouraged increases in construction and housing purchases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2014, however, the excesses within the sector were readily apparent. Numerous stories circulated in media concerning ghost towns as developers built outside of major cities far in excess of fundamental demand. Beijing launched a shantytown redevelopment program to resettle residents living in older homes by encouraging them to buy from the ample stocks of housing. Trust companies started to face defaults on loans to developers and reduced lending to the sector, which was one cause of a widespread slowdown in the economy in 2014 and 2015 led by weaker property construction. Steel and other commodity prices dropped sharply, but the output of raw materials did not because most firms were able to roll over their loans, in part by using shadow banking channels. As a result, China started to face significant deflationary pressures in producer prices, which stayed negative for four consecutive years, from 2012 to 2016. While producer prices were negative, consumer prices fluctuated but generally grew. This can be most easily explained by the fact that most credits went to state-owned producers, who continued operating even if profits were declining because they were trying to avoid job cuts and potential political instability. In November 2014, the central bank started cutting interest rates to reduce real borrowing costs for firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the property sector weakened significantly in 2014, the great ball of money shifted to China’s equity market. The Shanghai Composite Index began rising in late 2014, but there seemed to be little macroeconomic logic behind the move. With the economy flagging, led by the property sector, many expected policymakers would step in to support growth, but there has been little evidence of such support so far. China’s equity markets had long been likened to casinos, but part of the reason for their volatility was the investor base, which consisted of far more retail investors and momentum traders than fundamental investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As China’s equity markets were highly responsive to policy changes and liquidity conditions, it was the liquidity conditions and speculative activity that drove most of the epic boom and bust in China’s stock market in 2015, which then forced Chinese leadership to respond to stem the market’s rapid descent. Margin trading was facilitated by lending from shadow banks, which expanded rapidly throughout the early months of 2015. Nie Qingping, the ex-chairman of the China Securities Finance Corporation (CSFC), the very vehicle Beijing used to bail out the stock market in 2015, said that the more than 3 trillion yuan ($440 billion) from banks’ WMPs was fueling margin trading in the stock market. As share prices rose, investors pledged the shares they had just purchased as collateral for additional margin loans (Figure 2.4). Naturally, when prices declined, this exacerbated the decline in share values. The collapse was so rapid that Beijing was forced to buy around 2 trillion yuan ($294 billion) in stocks using the CSFC to attempt to prevent a more dramatic sell-off. More direct interventions included prohibitions on short selling and security forces starting to investigate the causes of the sell-off. Since 2015, China’s stock prices have not rebounded to the levels where Chinese authorities decided to buy large volumes of stocks to stabilize the market. Most of the funds allowed speculators to exit the market, and the property market stabilized again as investors moved from the equity market back into housing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April 2016, the frenzy spread to commodities markets, and trading in Chinese commodities futures started to exceed trading volumes on all Chinese equities exchanges and even the Nasdaq at its dot-com-era peak in 2000. Short-term money market rates were extremely stable at around 2 percent, which allowed NBFIs to take risks in a number of different assets. Corporate bonds were also bought aggressively on leverage, as an environment of lower interest rates and a weaker Chinese economy meant very few types of assets could actually generate the returns necessary to repay WMP investors. Leveraged bets were therefore necessary, and corporate bond spreads to risk-free assets dropped to all-time lows. P2P lending networks popped up around China, borrowing from individuals at high rates and lending at even higher rates. Many of the borrowers from P2P platforms were small private businesses and lower-income households borrowing for down payments for mortgage loans. The great ball of money just rolled on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;regulatory-whack-a-mole&quot;&gt;Regulatory Whack-a-Mole&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The obvious question that emerges from these stories of financial speculation is why regulators did not notice the risks building and respond more quickly. Bureaucratic factors explain some of the regulatory oversight, in part because no regulator could see the whole picture. Shadow banking activity had grown precisely to avoid regulatory oversight. As a result, regulators struggled to understand the size of total shadow banking activity. In 2012, individual Chinese institutions had narrow regulatory mandates, with the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) covering banks and trust companies, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) covering securities companies, and the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC) regulating insurance firms. So, when regulations on one form of lending emerged, such as prohibitions on banks cooperating directly with trust companies in 2010, banks would simply shift their channel business to a different type of NBFI governed by a different regulator. Shadow banking was seemingly no one’s responsibility, and regulators could see only individual pieces of a rapidly developing puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the deleveraging campaign, there were several iterations of this game of whack-a-mole with different forms of shadow banking activity. In April 2014, for example, all five financial regulators in China, led by the PBOC, issued Circular No. 127, which meaningfully limited banks’ ability to conceal loans and other assets as collateral within interbank transactions. But the net effect was simply for banks to shift shadow banking activity to other classifications, including “investment receivables” and “directional asset management plans.” Until the deleveraging campaign started, all of these controls focused on the lenders rather than the funding sources — the WMPs themselves. This changed with the imposition of new asset management rules in 2018, which were one of the most significant elements of Beijing’s deleveraging effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, regulators themselves were not always interested in quickly controlling asset growth within their particular areas of jurisdiction. While they were keen to avoid systemic financial risks from developing (and potentially taking the blame for them), many local governments and state-owned firms clearly benefited from the expansion of shadow financing activities. Regulators within individual financial sectors had incentives to grow their industries as well as to expand their industries’ imprints within the economy. Regulators often competed with one another to grow their sectors’ overall asset bases, which would make their areas of jurisdiction more significant within the economy. One of the justifications for the deleveraging campaign was to address this patchwork of controls over shadow banking activities in China’s financial system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;attention-must-be-paid&quot;&gt;Attention Must Be Paid&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The structure of China’s financial system changed significantly between 2012 and 2016. Before 2012, China’s bank-centric financial system was generally inefficient but stable. The banks’ funding was primarily concentrated in deposits from both households and corporations. Those state-owned banks then lent predominantly to SOEs, which inefficiently invested the capital relative to more efficient private firms. China generally posted surpluses in its international balance of payments, and as a result, there were more deposits flowing into the system most of the time. Banks seldom needed to compete for funding against one another. The system may have been lethargic, but it seemed highly resistant to a system-wide crisis. Beijing had made choices to deliberately prioritize stability over efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2016, the entire structure of China’s financial system had changed. Marginal funding growth for the banking system came from WMPs or other non-deposit instruments rather than deposits. Banks needed to compete against one another for funding by offering higher and higher interest rates, which required them to take additional risks in lending to earn higher returns. As a result, banks’ marginal lending decisions were more likely to be placed with a third-party asset manager, such as a trust company, an asset management firm, or a brokerage, rather than a conventional loan. In addition, China faced significant changes in its international payments, with periods of strong inflows and strong outflows. Banks’ deposit levels fluctuated more regularly, making them more reliant upon the interbank money market for funding and requiring them to constantly compete for deposits and WMP funding. All of these developments made the financial system not only far more unstable but also far more difficult for Beijing to control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2016, Beijing was losing one of its primary policy levers to control the economy — the allocation of credit — because banks were engaging in regulatory arbitrage and shifting money to the shadow banking system. Far from controlling flows of credit, Chinese regulators were struggling to monitor where money was going within the financial system. Most forms of shadow banking existed to deliberately avoid government regulations on capital risk weightings or to hide lending to restricted borrowers such as LGFVs or property developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the changing structure of the system was generating significant financial risks. The off-balance-sheet structures that banks were using, which involved channeling money from depositors and investors into opaque off-balance-sheet vehicles, appeared very similar to the SPVs and special investment vehicles (SIVs) that had been exposed at U.S. banks during the 2007–08 global financial crisis. Banks were still likely to bear some risk if the investments defaulted because they would have reputational risks to their customers. Most customers thought the investments were essentially guaranteed because there were very few historical defaults. The investments continued becoming riskier and riskier because banks and NBFIs needed to seek higher returns to pay their investors higher rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire financial system appeared to be subsidized by the state as well, with private investors capable of generating strong returns from WMPs while any losses on shadow bank loans would be backstopped by local or central government. China had shifted from a system of financial repression, in which depositors had little control over where to place their money, to a system of widespread moral hazard. Both the liabilities and assets sides of banks’ balance sheets were becoming riskier, and the actors contributing to that risk assumed the state would ultimately provide support if any losses materialized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Politically, this was an enormous challenge for Beijing. Most Chinese officials had no intention of ever subsidizing losses in risky lending schemes such as P2P networks or property market speculation. But popular belief in the government’s guarantees was strong. Delivering a public message that losses on these risky investments were probable would shock financial markets accustomed to government intervention to stabilize conditions. It would risk repeating the consequences of the PBOC’s message to banks to rely upon themselves during the interbank market crisis in 2013. Losses might spark protests among angry investors. But larger losses from rapidly expanding financial bubbles were even more probable if the system kept expanding in the same fashion as it had from 2012 to 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the situation facing Beijing in 2016 when Chinese authorities decided to launch the deleveraging campaign. The financial system was no longer a shock absorber that allowed the party to manage political risks. It was starting to create political risks on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;averting-a-looming-crisis&quot;&gt;Averting a Looming Crisis&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing’s primary fear in 2016 was that if the financial system continued growing at such a rapid rate and in the same unregulated fashion, more financial bubbles would start to burst, similar to what had just taken place in the equity market the previous year. Those bubbles could potentially have much greater political fallout, particularly in the property market, given high homeownership rates in China. Party leadership was forced to contemplate difficult choices about how to slow the growth of overall debt and shrink the shadow banking system without affecting the broader economy too severely, which could trigger unemployment and social discontent. Furthermore, they needed to avoid rapid and dramatic changes in policy that might trigger a rerun of the June 2013 interbank market crisis or another financial market contagion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deleveraging campaign started with a high-profile interview with an “authoritative personage” published on May 9, 2016, in the People’s Daily, the CCP’s newspaper. Often, significant policy changes in China begin with a high-level message from leadership, usually via state media channels, including the People’s Daily. This communicates key policy messages internally, within China’s bureaucracy so that party cadres understand new priorities. The interview occupied almost the entire section below the front-page fold and filled the entire second page as well. It outlined a remarkable critique of the pattern of China’s growth seen from 2012 to 2016 and the limits of China’s traditional policy tools to stabilize the economy: “Economic stabilization relies on the old method, which is investment-driven, and fiscal pressure in some areas has added up to possibilities of economic risks.” Clearly identifying leverage and debt as the culprits, the quasi-official voice argued, “A tree cannot grow to the sky, and high leverage carries high risks. Mishandled, it will lead to a systemic financial crisis, causing an economic recession, and even lead the people’s savings to fizzle out, which would be dangerous. This comparison shows us where the emphasis of the work must be — there cannot be additional leverage in order to stimulate the economy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many suspected the voice in the People’s Daily article was Liu He, then deputy head of the National Development and Reform Commission and the leading official managing economic and financial affairs, or the collective voice of his office at the Central Economic and Financial Leading Group. The commentary not only inveighed against more traditional forms of stimulus using local government investment by calling for more significant financial reform but also commented that leverage is the “original sin” and a “source of high financial risks,” which amplified potential risks in movements of the exchange rate, as well as property and capital markets. The voice warned, “Big stimulus will only result in bubbles, which is a must-learn lesson.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interview focused extensively on setting expectations for lower economic growth in the near future and avoiding the short-term thinking that had dominated stimulus efforts for the economy up to that point. By identifying leverage as the core problem facing China’s financial system, the article created political space for financial technocrats to start producing concrete proposals to cut debt levels throughout the system. Fundamentally, the deleveraging campaign was about targeting the shadow banking sector — both in terms of lending and bank funding activities. China’s leadership merely wanted to reduce the potential for systemic financial risks that might create political problems. China’s financial technocrats faced a more difficult challenge in reducing banks’ reliance upon the specific channels for borrowing and lending that had evaded regulatory controls thus far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;why-deleveraging&quot;&gt;Why “Deleveraging”?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deleveraging campaign was successfully launched only because the concept of “deleveraging” itself could be interpreted differently depending on a range of political objectives. Structural reform was difficult because entrenched interests had always maintained the system as it was. Local governments continued to rely upon easy credit to fund new investments, maintaining employment and growth. Property prices continued to rise, incentivizing new purchases and land development. Banks had few incentives to declare losses individually in order to keep growing. Maintaining a political coalition in favor of controlling the growth of the financial system and overall credit was a difficult challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its core, deleveraging is about the reduction of China’s debt levels over time. China’s aggregate debt burden started expanding rapidly in 2009 with the postcrisis stimulus, labeled as a 4 trillion yuan ($588 billion) investment package, which was in reality far larger, as previously discussed. Most significantly, local governments led this stimulus effort and funded it via the banking system rather than out of fiscal revenues. The International Monetary Fund’s Global Financial Stability Report placed China’s debt-to-GDP ratio at 254 percent in 2016, up from only 142 percent in 2006. China’s nonfinancial corporate sector debt at the time was equivalent to 165 percent of GDP, the highest among major economies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the deleveraging campaign was not simply about reducing debt, as it was primarily focused on mitigating overall financial risks. As a result, virtually any program to reduce perceived financial risks could effectively be wrapped in the guise of the broader deleveraging campaign. The high-level endorsements of these objectives by the authoritative personage in the People’s Daily and subsequent Politburo statements would help to reinforce the leadership’s support for these objectives. Many goals of the deleveraging campaign were advanced by different interest groups within China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/PnmctvV.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For purely financial technocrats, such as those at the central bank and banking regulator, deleveraging narrowly represented an attempt to reduce the potential financial risks associated with high and rapidly growing debt-to-GDP and credit-to-GDP ratios (Figure 3.1). For these technocrats, any opportunity to control overall credit growth was welcome. But for advocates of the interests of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), the deleveraging push provided an opportunity to reduce the debt burdens on SOE balance sheets so that SOEs could operate more freely in the future with less concern for the broader consequences for system-wide financial stability. For economic planners more focused on China’s long-term growth trajectory, the deleveraging effort also took aim at an obstacle to maintaining targeted growth rates in the form of the servicing costs of China’s existing debt. The Politburo’s support for deleveraging and high-level messages in support of that goal allowed all of these camps to push forward with their own objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these steps in combination reflected a campaign within China’s political structure — not a Western political campaign in advance of a democratic election but a style of Chinese politics that involves the mobilization of bureaucratic institutions toward particular targets or objectives using propaganda and persistent messaging. Early versions of these campaigns in the 1950s and 1960s attempted to generate mass participation in political movements because of the lack of effective bureaucratic institutions in China’s system at the time. Modern campaigns are more about mobilizing bureaucracies and communicating top leadership priorities meant to change lower-level officials’ behavior. The fervor of the high-level commitment from leadership reinforces lower-level officials’ attempts to comply with the needs of the campaign. However, campaign-style governance limits policy bandwidth because officials can only be focused intensely on a few issues at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s Politburo regularly issues statements following its near-quarterly meetings on economic work, and these are often interpreted as important signals of the CCP leadership’s priorities and intentions when it comes to economic policy. Immediately following the authoritative personage interview in the People’s Daily, Politburo’s statements started to emphasize the importance of deleveraging-related objectives. In late October 2016, the Politburo commented that China needed to “curb asset bubbles and safeguard against economic and financial risks.” The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) released quarterly monetary policy reports as well, and in the fourth quarter of 2016, the report focused heavily on the property market, with several references to the pernicious effects of “bubbles” and the need to limit the overall credit impulse to contain financial speculation. The central bank used the word “bubble” 16 times in the 2016 fourth-quarter report (versus 7 times in the previous report). Within the PBOC’s monetary policy reports, special columns command the most attention because they are inserted entirely at the discretion of PBOC staff to discuss timely and unusual policy issues. The fourth-quarter report features a special column discussing the relationship between asset prices, monetary policy, and property prices. It argues that macro-prudential policy alone is not enough to curb asset bubbles, which in fact requires establishing a new policy framework with two pillars: monetary policy and macro-prudential policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following a Politburo statement in April 2017 emphasizing the importance of financial security, China’s official Xinhua News Agency published seven commentaries over the course of a week in early May 2017 calling for upgraded regulation of the financial sector and urging financial institutions to take their own responsibility in improving risk controls. The commentaries also pledged to address risks and require local governments to cooperate with central government efforts in order to better serve the real economy. The lead commentary linked financial security with national security, arguing, “Financial security is defined as ‘an important issue of governing the country,’ suggesting it is an issue concerning the overall development plan of the CPC and the country, the country’s economic and social development and national security work. Everyone needs to have a full understanding of this.” These were strong signals of support for both monetary tightening and regulation from China’s highest leadership, and these policy signals were unlikely to be reversed quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China also held a significant meeting concerning financial work every five years, typically labeled as the National Financial Work Conference (NFWC). Previous conferences had proposed fundamental changes to China’s financial system, including the bailouts and restructurings of state-owned banks following the Asian financial crisis. Following the conference held in July 2017, the Xinhua News Agency published an aggressive 3,300-word story using the word risk 28 times and regulation 22 times and describing deleveraging as a long-term campaign. In addition, the leadership used new rhetoric to point out the importance of controlling financial “aggregates,” suggesting that the overall growth of the financial sector was emerging as a key benchmark for the success of deleveraging. Politburo statements supporting deleveraging continued for several quarters, as the December 2017 statement claimed that leverage should be effectively controlled, the financial sector should better support the real economy, and a higher priority should be placed on reducing risks. The Politburo statement referenced three major “battles,” which included controlling financial risks, fighting poverty, and reducing pollution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These leadership messages clearly provided political space for many bureaucratic agencies to advance their own efforts in support of the deleveraging campaign. But politically, it was difficult for financial technocrats to maintain momentum to reduce aggregate debt and credit. A more aggressive and vocal regulatory effort from other agencies risked generating too much attention and internal political opposition from all of the local governments and SOEs that required ongoing access to credit. For many years, the PBOC tried to implement smaller, quieter, and more incremental tightening steps that required fewer internal approvals but eventually produced changes in incentives in order to try to reduce risky behavior within the financial system. But with other institutions such as the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) and China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC) turning up the political volume on the deleveraging campaign, there was a growing risk of alarm among banks, local governments, and potentially higher-level political leaders. Ultimately, the PBOC led the first salvoes in the extended battle against shadow banks by tightening monetary conditions and raising short-term money market rates. But they had to tread cautiously to avoid generating systemic financial risks as they had in June 2013. And they also had to avoid generating any internal political perception that the deleveraging campaign was slowing the economy significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;monetary-tightening&quot;&gt;Monetary Tightening&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the May 2016 People’s Daily interview and rhetoric from China’s political leaders, the first actions in the deleveraging campaign came from the PBOC, China’s central bank. Banks had seen a significant change in their funding structures from 2012 to 2016 and were much more dependent upon funding from wealth management products (WMPs). In addition, more banks and nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs) were borrowing aggressively from the short-term repo market in order to place leveraged bets in more speculative asset markets and boost returns. This meant that banks and NBFIs were far more vulnerable to changes in short-term funding conditions in China’s money markets. If repo rates suddenly moved higher or became even more volatile, it became far riskier to sustain leveraged positions in risky assets because a change in funding costs could quickly push those positions into losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PBOC started the process of raising short-term money market rates on August 24, 2016. After a long period of stability in its regular open market operations (OMO), the central bank suddenly introduced 14-day reverse repurchase operations (reverse repos) at 2.4 percent rather than the more traditional seven-day funding at a fixed rate of 2.25 percent. The effect of this move was to introduce uncertainty about the PBOC’s intentions and to boost short-term overnight repo market rates, which edged higher into the 2.1–2.2 percent range. Rather than an outright hike in interest rates, the PBOC’s move raised the average weighted funding costs in the money market. But the market noticed the PBOC’s change in behavior right away and became far more sensitive to future tightening signals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PBOC then engaged in a more persuasive policy operation by instructing banks to reduce their borrowing overnight and encouraging them to borrow at longer terms, which would have the effect of raising overall funding costs for banks and NBFIs. At the same time, to reinforce the effect of the policy guidance, the central bank offered larger volumes of longer-duration funding via its medium-term lending facility (MLF), which typically offered funding for a full year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These steps advanced incrementally, but they had clear effects on China’s money markets. Overnight rates rose from the 2.0–2.1 percent range in July and August 2016 to 2.4–2.7 percent by December 2016, with occasional spikes even higher. All of this occurred before the PBOC had formally adjusted the interest rates it offered to the market for short-term financing, which are more commonly viewed as the relevant policy interest rates for the central bank. The central bank’s first formal hike in these OMO interest rates did not occur until February 2017 and eventually produced four separate hikes totaling 30 basis points, with the last of the cycle occurring in April 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rise in short-term money market rates and the sudden injection of policy volatility basically had the desired effect, which was to reduce the attractiveness of short-term borrowing in order to take leveraged positions into longer-term assets. With weaker demand for bonds, yields rose and bond issuance declined. Overall credit growth had not yet started to slow, but the shadow banking components of credit growth were starting to decelerate and unwind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even though the direction of the policy adjustment was intended, the PBOC struggled to control its magnitude, as the monetary tightening campaign produced some significant shocks in the interbank market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In December 2016, a small securities company called Sealand Securities indicated it might refuse to honor some esoteric forms of entrusted bond contracts, in which securities companies would temporarily warehouse bonds for banks or other third parties. The bonds involved were safer policy bank bonds, but the concern that spread through the market was that other NBFIs might walk away from similar deals. As a result, banks stopped lending to NBFIs in the same volumes, and there was quickly a liquidity squeeze in the market, given that NBFIs were the primary borrowers throughout China’s interbank market. In order to calm the squeeze, the PBOC even needed to extend trading hours on some days in order to prevent defaults on interbank payments, which had touched off the June 2013 crisis. Then, regulators, led by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), needed to gather the creditors of the firm into a meeting over the weekend in order to manage the resulting fallout and prevent further contagion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More generally, the Sealand Securities scandal exposed an uncomfortable reality for the PBOC and its deleveraging effort: the potential for overstepping and triggering unintended consequences was readily apparent. The market contagion from credit risk among even very small institutions caused a significant sell-off in China’s fixed-income markets and forced regulators to directly intervene, refusing to allow Sealand to back away from the contracts. Even as the PBOC was trying to break the pattern, market stability in China depended upon widespread implicit guarantees. Any deviation from that pattern led to immediate shocks and market instability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ItZWg5u.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3.2: Changes in Short-Term Interbank Market Repo Rates, February 2016–December 2018.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Bloomberg.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were other limits to the PBOC’s monetary tightening efforts as well. For every action trying to contain the growth of China’s shadow banking system, there is seemingly an equal and opposite reaction by banks trying to maintain funding channels and expand their balance sheets. By limiting short-term borrowing via overnight repo markets, negotiable certificates of deposit (NCDs) issued in the interbank market quickly grew to become an alternative funding source for banks, particularly for joint stock and city commercial banks. This caused short-term interbank funding rates for banks to rise, which in turn passed higher interest rates on to borrowers in the real economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a way, NCD funding was riskier than funding from the interbank market because banks could simply issue the NCDs without any collateral. Because banks were presumed to be state-owned and guaranteed, this was an unlimited new higher-interest financing channel. In addition, the NCDs created new pressure to roll over the instruments, just as WMPs had created. Banks had to increasingly issue short-term NCDs at higher and higher costs. Ironically, without new regulations on this practice, the PBOC’s monetary tightening campaign was likely to create new financial risks without meaningfully limiting banks’ funding costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were other limits to the PBOC’s monetary tightening efforts as well. In trying to encourage NBFIs to reduce speculative assets, the PBOC was attempting to deny these institutions short-term funding. But the counterintuitive effect of such a liquidity squeeze was to force NBFIs to immediately sell any assets they could to raise money. Often, these were not risky but safer assets, including government bonds and policy bank bonds. After all, these assets were by far the most liquid in the market, making them an easy choice for traders to sell. But sales of these government and policy bank bonds forced issuers’ yields higher. Policy banks such as the China Development Bank and the Agricultural Development Bank of China depended upon the bond market for funding. But their business was largely making low-cost loans to local governments and SOEs. After a sell-off in the bond market in late October and early November 2017, policy banks could barely sell any bonds at yields below 5 percent, which made it difficult for policy banks to operate, given that most of their loans were made with yields around 4 percent. As a result of the deleveraging campaign, policy bank bond issuance dropped by over 30 percent in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the PBOC’s best efforts, monetary tightening was creating new problems of its own by the end of 2017. Short-term funding rates were higher and shadow banks were under pressure, but overall credit growth had barely slowed. Banks were finding alternative mechanisms to circumvent the effects of the PBOC’s controls on short-term financing. Property sales, prices, and new construction were still booming. Brokerages and fund assets were under pressure, but banks were able to shift some of the channel business to trust firms instead of these lines of credit completely disappearing. Overall financial risks were still rising, arguably, as banks and NBFIs were incentivized to take risks in more speculative lending. Monetary policy tightening was necessary but ultimately insufficient to squeeze shadow banks. Beijing needed to tighten the regulatory noose on banks and nonbank institutions as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;regulatory-tightening&quot;&gt;Regulatory Tightening&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The regulatory measures that Beijing introduced from 2017 to 2018 constituted the most significant changes in policy toward China’s shadow banking sector. Beijing was aware that previous regulations had been only a patchwork approach, and a more integrated effort to address banks’ reliance upon WMPs and other non-deposit liabilities was necessary. The overall focus of these regulatory efforts was to illuminate and highlight the risks in the system by forcing off-balance-sheet funding and loans back onto banks’ formal balance sheets. The other key focus was to break the assumption of implicit guarantees behind banks’ issuance of WMPs. For the shadow banking system to be controlled, investors and depositors needed to understand that they could face losses, even on products that banks were issuing. Beijing was trying to address the moral hazard at the heart of the financial system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A New Macroprudential Framework Enforced by the PBOC:&lt;/strong&gt; The PBOC, CBRC, CSRC, and other institutions introduced several new regulations and circulars throughout the most intense periods of the deleveraging campaign. One of the more significant early steps was the introduction of a new macroprudential assessment framework by the PBOC. The central bank would review critical indicators of banks’ assets and liabilities on a quarterly basis and would assign an A, B, or C classification to the bank, which potentially influenced its access to central bank liquidity facilities or its regulatory treatment. In December 2016, the PBOC decided to include banks’ reliance on WMPs in the quarterly macroprudential assessment, which placed banks on notice that more regulations targeting non-deposit liabilities were likely to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asset Management Rules Targeting WMPs and Off-Balance-Sheet Assets:&lt;/strong&gt; The most significant regulatory changes that China introduced during the deleveraging campaign concerned rules governing almost all investment and funding products, on both the liability and asset sides of banks’ balance sheets. These were more comprehensive in scope and covered almost all financial institutions, banks, trusts, brokerages, and funds in order to avoid the regulatory whack-a-mole problem. These were informally called the “asset management rules,” and the first draft of these regulations was issued in February 2017. A further draft was refined in November 2017, and the final version was released in late April 2018. The rules had relaxed somewhat over the drafting process, primarily by allowing banks a longer grace period to change the structure of their asset bases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core of the new asset management rules was designed to curb shadow banking growth and limit banks’ “channel” business, placing funds with third-party asset managers and NBFIs. The new rules banned any implicit or explicit guarantees on WMPs or asset management products, which had been the foundation of the rapid growth in shadow banking channels from 2012 to 2016. Asset management products were not permitted to invest, directly or indirectly, via either debt or equity into industries or sectors that were targeted by government regulations and explicit credit restrictions, such as lending to property developers and local government funding vehicles (LGFVs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the rules challenged banks’ existing procedures by permitting only one level of intermediation within asset management products, making it more difficult for banks to bypass various regulatory controls. For example, banks seldom invested directly in trust products. They would invest in asset management products issued by brokerages first and then use these funds to invest in trust products, avoiding a 10 percent risk capital requirement. This type of cooperation was very common among asset management products and NBFIs but would not be allowed under the new rules, which also disallowed funding these types of assets from “pooled” financing by banks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the new asset management rules required that WMP investments be marked to market for investors to see both profits and losses. This meant that if WMPs started generating losses, investors would know how their investments would be marked down. Most retail and institutional investors bought WMPs on the assumption they were as safe as deposits while offering higher returns, and official losses were likely to frighten many current and potential investors. The logic of the new rules was that banks would face problems rolling over WMPs in driving overall balance sheet growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marking WMPs to market was a hugely disruptive event within the financial system, and banks strongly resisted the implementation of these rules. Some sought a caveat, in which cash-type WMPs that invested in short-term money market instruments and nothing longer than a year in maturity could still be sold to investors on a cost basis instead of marking the products to market. Naturally, banks attempted to classify more of their WMPs as “cash-type” to avoid the new regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1SIQevD.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Liquidity Management Guidelines to Discourage Short-Term Borrowing:&lt;/strong&gt; The other major regulatory rules the CBRC introduced in December 2017 concerned banks’ management of liquidity, which involved guidance of their liabilities’ structures and their assets. Generally, the idea of these new liquidity management rules was to force banks to borrow using longer-term, higher-cost funding and to shrink the duration of their assets so as to reduce the potential liquidity mismatch or any financial problems that would result from failing to roll over short-term funding instruments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2018, the CBRC introduced new rules to limit the use of wholesale short-term funding to invest in longer-term assets. This was in the form of a new guideline labeled the liquidity matching ratio (LMR). Anything banks borrowed that was shorter than three months in maturity from the interbank market — most importantly including NCDs — received a zero value within the calculation of the LMR, which discouraged banks from selling one-month NCDs and encouraged longer-term (3–6 months) NCD issuance. The LMR discouraged banks from engaging in interbank and shadow banking business in favor of traditional deposit and loan business. If a bank did absolutely nothing but accept deposits and make loans, it would easily meet the LMR threshold. However, most interbank businesses and other investments (shadow banking activities) had higher weights in the denominator, increasing the difficulty of achieving the required ratios for banks heavily involved in off-balance-sheet lending. The net effect of the new ratios was to reduce banks’ reliance upon short-term funding in the form of NCDs or WMPs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Regulations Limiting the Use of NCDs to Circumvent WMP Regulations:&lt;/strong&gt; NCDs were targeted specifically as well. While in the past NCDs were technically classified not as interbank liabilities but as “bonds payable,” regulators closed that loophole in August 2017. At that point, banks were then subject to a preexisting limit that interbank liabilities could only be one-third of banks’ total liabilities. The regulation then effectively cut off one of banks’ most important marginal sources of funding growth and left them with a choice to either raise additional deposits or allow their balance sheets to shrink as these short-term funding instruments rolled off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulations to Force Loans Back onto Banks’ Balance Sheets:&lt;/strong&gt; On the asset side of the balance sheet, regulators encouraged banks to migrate their off-balance-sheet assets back onto the formal balance sheet in the form of loans. To a certain extent, this process was automatic, as the inability to roll over a short-term funding instrument meant that a shadow lender or NBFI was suddenly short of funding; therefore, a claim on the NBFI ended up as a claim on the underlying borrower. The exact scale of the targeted reduction in off-balance-sheet assets remained undeclared. Most reports claimed there was informal guidance targeting around a one-third reduction in shadow banking activity by the end of 2020, or around 8 trillion yuan ($1.2 trillion) in assets moving back to formal balance sheets. Banks’ claims on NBFIs would need to shrink by 2–3 trillion yuan per year to meet that target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limits on “Cash Pooling” within WMPs:&lt;/strong&gt; A December 2018 decision placed further restrictions on how WMPs could operate. The CBRC issued a new circular that required banks to run their WMP business in a separate entity from the bank itself so that cash pooling from WMPs could not be used to fund assets within banks’ formal loan books. Clarifying that banks’ WMPs were separate subsidiaries was also designed to limit the potential risk to the banks’ own liquidity in the case that WMP funding dried up quickly, as in the June 2013 interbank market crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulations on Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Lending Networks:&lt;/strong&gt; Beijing also experimented with various regulations on P2P lenders in 2016 and 2017. P2P private lenders were often among the riskiest forms of shadow financing, and they evolved quickly to provide short-term loans to small businesses as well as down payments for mortgages for lower-income households. Regulations introduced in 2016 prohibited these products from pooling funds, holding deposits, or providing guaranteed returns to customers. The rules also limited individual and corporate loan levels per platform in an effort to squeeze the scope of these businesses. Additional regulations forced these platforms to register officially with authorities and obtain online lending licenses. These platforms started to weaken significantly in 2017 and 2018, and many collapses and defaults generated protests from dissatisfied investors, including a significant protest of thousands of people in Beijing in August 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explicit Targets for SOEs to Cut Leverage Ratios:&lt;/strong&gt; New regulations on SOEs were imposed as well, with explicit targets on leverage ratios for some types of state firms. In September 2018, the CCP’s Central Committee and the State Council issued a joint circular, officially publicizing a deleveraging target for the first time, requiring all SOEs to cut leverage by 2 percentage points from 2017 levels by the end of 2020. SOEs were encouraged to engage in debt-to-equity swaps in order to reduce their aggregate debt burden. The PBOC also included specific funding allocated for such debt-to-equity swaps, often when cutting banks’ required reserve ratios. Ultimately, banks were reluctant to engage in these debt-to-equity swaps with SOEs, and actual implementation was very limited. State firms then attempted to meet the regulatory requirements by issuing perpetual bonds, which would not be included in official debt calculations since they are typically classified as equity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flurry of regulatory tightening conditions had a meaningful impact on banks’ engagement with NBFIs. Rather than a whack-a-mole approach to looking at individual forms of lending, the regulatory tightening steps targeted the funding side of banks’ balance sheets and the WMPs and NCDs that had sustained shadow banking activity. As the next chapter discusses, overall shadow banking assets started declining in 2017, and China saw the slowest pace of overall credit growth in recent history in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the success of regulatory tightening allowed Beijing to take the pressure off the banking system via monetary policy and actually ease monetary conditions starting in 2018. With more confidence that the regulatory structure to control shadow banking activity had been strengthened, Beijing was able to reduce interest rates to manage potential financial stress. Monetary tightening was a necessary condition for deleveraging to succeed, but regulatory tightening became the primary tool to achieve deleveraging after monetary tightening produced unintended consequences. In a highly indebted economy and a risky financial system, continued monetary tightening would have likely generated significant new financial risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reorganization-of-government-bureaucracies&quot;&gt;Reorganization of Government Bureaucracies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most significant elements of the deleveraging campaign was the reorganization of China’s regulatory structure governing the financial system. The creation of a “super regulator” had been a subject of discussion in China for several years. In 2013 the State Council, at the request of the PBOC, agreed to establish an inter-ministerial joint meeting for financial regulation and coordination. This was an organization with no real power, but it became useful for communication purposes across financial bureaucracies. One of the main reasons such coordination is necessary is the development of financial institutions with mixed operations — those that operate as commercial banks, asset managers, and insurance providers. The three individual regulators were divided in their supervision of such institutions, enabling them to take on far greater risks than any one regulatory agency would permit. A super regulator would unify those bureaucratic responsibilities while avoiding the problem of banks and NBFIs restructuring assets or liabilities to avoid regulatory oversight by an individual agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NFWC that took place in July 2017 created the leadership consensus around a new regulatory agency, which ended up becoming the Financial Stability and Development Committee (FSDC) under the State Council, created in November 2017. The agency was a financial coordination commission above the PBOC and the other three financial regulatory institutions — the CBRC, CSRC, and CIRC. In the end, Liu He led the committee, with the central bank managing daily operations. The other key change resulting from this reorganization was the merger of the operations of the CIRC and CBRC into a new China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next year, the FSDC was the primary institution rolling out new regulations consistent with the deleveraging campaign’s objectives. The establishment of the committee corresponded with the most aggressive period of regulatory tightening, with Beijing’s resources concentrated to avoid the potential for regulatory arbitrage. Most significantly, the deleveraging campaign was important enough for China to contemplate a wholesale reorganization of its bureaucratic structure for financial regulation. In turn, that bureaucratic reorganization was necessary for the broader deleveraging effort to gain momentum and for an effective transition from monetary to regulatory tightening efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;controls-on-local-government-debt-and-investment&quot;&gt;Controls on Local Government Debt and Investment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to regulatory controls on banks and NBFIs, Chinese authorities intensified their focus on local governments themselves since localities had been key drivers of credit demand for many years, both via direct borrowing and indirectly via LGFVs and related companies. Local government debt had been in focus for Chinese regulators for years, with a 12.2 trillion yuan ($1.8 trillion) “swap bond” program launched from 2015 to 2018, designed to replace higher-interest debt from shadow banks with low-interest debt from local government bonds. After the swap bond program, local governments were intended to only be able to borrow money by selling bonds. In addition, the swap bonds were supposed to retire all of their hidden obligations, making them more transparent in the form of bond debt. But in reality, local governments underreported the actual size of their borrowing from shadow banks and were still servicing large quantities of debt after the swap. Even worse, their debt continued expanding after the restructuring effort, not only through shadow banking channels but also through more direct borrowing from banks by local SOEs, LGFVs, and other local public institutions such as universities and hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By early 2018, Chinese authorities placed these more expansive categories of debt under the regulatory microscope and implemented measures to reduce implicit debts incurred by local governments. There were several circulars released by local Ministry of Finance offices attempting to force localities to disclose total levels of implicit debt, with the idea of eventually controlling it. The debt totals would include debt incurred by local governments, financing platforms (LGFVs), SOEs, and public institutions in nonbond forms of borrowing used to fund public welfare projects. Implicit debt generally included any form of borrowing that would eventually require fiscal funds to repay the debt. The specified forms of financing in the circulars included bank loans, trust loans, commercial leasing, corporate bonds, public-private partnerships, procurement, equity financing, government-guided funds, and private equity. These circulars claimed that the objective was to repay all local government implicit debt within three to five years. Naturally, reducing these forms of borrowing would also slow economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing had always maintained an ambiguous relationship regarding central government support for local government fiscal obligations. While Beijing’s guarantees were often necessary in order to sell local government bonds at auction, the Ministry of Finance usually tried to argue that local government debt in general was to be managed at the provincial level or below, and Beijing had no intention of providing support. At the same time, the local debt situation had become so unsustainably large that there was no plausible path out of the debt problem other than Beijing providing direct support and incurring significant fiscal costs. In trying to encourage local governments to digest and reduce implicit debt, Beijing tried to eventually reduce its own fiscal obligations but with the acknowledged consequence that this was likely to slow the economy as well. But placing additional pressure on local governments to reduce their own borrowing was essential for the broader deleveraging campaign to succeed, reinforcing the effects of monetary and regulatory tightening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;moral-hazard-and-root-causes&quot;&gt;Moral Hazard and Root Causes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deleveraging campaign China launched in 2016 involved several tools and incremental steps — from monetary tightening efforts to tighter regulations on shadow banking to the reorganization of government bureaucracies and controls on local government implicit debt. Over time, these measures not only reduced credit and debt growth but also offered a far more stable policy environment involving less competition among China’s financial regulators. While credit became scarce in the short term, as discussed in the next chapter, squeezing shadow financing would also have the salutary effect of reducing funding costs for some Chinese corporations over the longer term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monetary and regulatory tightening are effective tools to control leverage growth temporarily, but they cannot eliminate the root cause of leverage in China: widespread moral hazard and implicit no-default guarantees. These guarantees allow banks, companies, and local governments to borrow recklessly, and as long as implicit guarantees exist, leverage will bounce back once monetary policy is eased and regulators loosen their controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even after the regulatory tightening campaign intensified, other forms of financing began slipping through the cracks, given the profound political incentives to continue borrowing and rolling over existing debt to fund new property construction and local government projects. Asset-backed securities became an alternative mechanism for property developers to borrow, first at small volumes and then ramping up in 2017 and 2018. Rather than competing based on WMP interest rates, banks started to offer structured deposits, which were designed essentially to offer higher interest rates to depositors based on obscure investment bets, making them similar to WMPs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Credit growth slowed significantly in 2018, with corporations the primary victims. But households actually expanded their overall borrowing. Because there were fewer alternative channels to lend to higher-interest borrowers via shadow banks and NBFIs, banks searched for the highest-interest lending opportunities available, which were mortgage loans to home buyers and credit card debt to consumers. In combination with the shantytown redevelopment program, this ended up driving another wave of speculation in the housing and land markets, even while overall credit growth remained under pressure. The property market’s resistance to deleveraging further fueled the bubble in the years ahead, as discussed in subsequent chapters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, regulatory tightening did not stop in 2018. The deleveraging campaign extended further, even after the economy had weakened and even following the outbreak of Covid-19 in early 2020. Because speculation in the property market had continued, in late August 2020, China introduced its most significant regulatory tightening step, the “three red lines,” explicitly limiting the borrowing of property developers according to specified financial ratios. This step was widely linked to the property market’s dramatic downturn starting in 2021 as developers cut off from financing were forced to scale back on new land purchases and place more inventory on an already crowded market. In 2021, the newly inaugurated CBIRC initiated new controls on borrowing by trust companies after trusts had avoided some of the harshest regulatory measures on NBFIs. The new limits targeted a 1 trillion yuan ($147 billion) reduction in trust loans over the full year, which ended up weakening the sector and LGFVs’ access to credit. Late in 2021, authorities also unveiled new controls over cash-type WMPs to reduce the types of assets and increase the quality of the assets banks could place within these instruments, which were designed to bypass the requirements to mark WMP investments to market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s deleveraging campaign hit shadow banks with multiple blows, and even after the most intense periods of the campaign in 2017 and 2018, additional incremental steps were rolled out in the following years. But the most effective step within the deleveraging effort was to precipitate defaults within China’s financial system, forcing financial institutions to start to price credit risk more effectively. Eliminating the widespread guarantees within China’s financial system was a necessary element for reducing overall systemic risks in China. But this step itself was dangerous, as investors who noticed guarantees breaking down in one asset market, such as P2P lenders or state-owned corporate bonds, would naturally wonder whether those guarantees might change elsewhere, thus causing investors to protect themselves, reduce risks, and sell assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing’s war against shadow banks was a complicated balancing act, reducing credit and allowing defaults to teach investors more accurate risk perceptions but without triggering systemic risks. These were Beijing’s intentions, but the actual effects of the deleveraging effort on the economy and financial system are explored in more detail in the following chapters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;deleveraging-and-chinas-financial-system&quot;&gt;Deleveraging and China’s Financial System&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter 3 described the mechanics of China’s deleveraging campaign and the individual actions that Beijing initiated in its efforts to shrink the shadow banking system. Monetary tightening progressed to regulatory tightening and a reorganization of government bureaucracies, accompanied by a broader effort to control local government debts. But China had often attempted to impose new limits on informal banking, and even a coordinated campaign such as that launched in 2016 was no guarantee of success in achieving Beijing’s objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter evaluates the results of Beijing’s efforts to control shadow banks, primarily based on the actions taken from 2016 to 2018, using data from banks themselves, as well as aggregate data from the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC), and other sources covering nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs). Financial results from 42 banks are reported here, covering around 66 percent of the total assets of China’s banking system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary effects of the deleveraging campaign on China’s financial system can be summarized as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall credit and debt growth slowed significantly, with an outright contraction of credit within the shadow banking system.&lt;/strong&gt; The campaign was generally successful in its primary objective, which was to reduce the size of the shadow banking system, particularly in terms of the volume of credit flowing through these less regulated channels. The shadow banks and NBFIs were large enough to have an impact on the overall pace of credit and debt growth in China’s economy, which slowed considerably in late 2017 and 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-deposit liabilities, such as wealth management products (WMPs) and other interbank liabilities, contracted and were replaced with more stable deposits.&lt;/strong&gt; Monetary tightening reduced leveraged positions in speculative markets, while regulatory efforts to mark WMPs’ investments to market value reduced the aggregate volume of interbank financing, forcing banks to attract deposits on their balance sheets. Regulatory pressure on negotiable certificates of deposit (NCDs) reduced the proportion of these instruments within overall bank funding structures. Initially, the household sector replaced some WMPs with structured deposits and, after a subsequent regulatory crackdown, shifted funds into safer time deposits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loans migrated back to the formal balance sheets of banks, replacing investment receivables and other types of credit assets.&lt;/strong&gt; The changing funding climate and the regulatory pressure on the channel business from banks to NBFIs caused a sharp reduction in these assets on banks’ balance sheets. The liquidity matching ratio (LMR) requirement and other regulatory measures encouraged banks to account for off-balance-sheet assets as loans. As a result, loans rose as a proportion of total assets within the banking system. Banks faced heavier pressure to boost capital levels to accommodate the rising level and proportion of bank loans on their balance sheets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The distribution of credit across provinces shifted, with the slowdown in credit concentrated in the northeastern and western provinces.&lt;/strong&gt; Many provincial governments had relied upon shadow banking channels to expand overall investment, and those provinces were hit hardest by the sector’s contraction. Coastal and southeastern provinces generally maintained their access to credit despite the deleveraging campaign, which also indicates the importance of the property market within those regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defaults and credit risk within informal financial institutions became far more common.&lt;/strong&gt; Starting with peer-to-peer (P2P) lending networks, which defaulted in large numbers in 2017 and 2018, the deleveraging campaign cut off many types of borrowers from credit, which resulted in difficulties in refinancing. Small banks began to default in 2019, and corporate bonds defaulted in much larger numbers by 2020. Property developers and trust companies started defaulting in larger volumes in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;an-overall-slowdown-in-credit-and-debt-growth&quot;&gt;An Overall Slowdown in Credit and Debt Growth&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deleveraging campaign’s primary impact on the financial system was to slow the rapid extension of credit and accumulation of debt that had marked the previous eight years since China’s 4 trillion yuan ($588 billion) stimulus package launched in late 2008. The overall pace of credit growth from 2009 to 2016, measured via bank asset growth, averaged 17.5 percent. In 2017, asset growth nosedived to 8.4 percent. By the end of 2018, it had hit an all-time low of 6.8 percent. While headline GDP growth was probably overstated for several years between 2014 and 2018, official real GDP growth averaged 7.0 percent over that five-year period. As a result, the deleveraging campaign formally lived up to its name, with aggregate leverage — credit and debt as a proportion of GDP — falling for one of the first times in China’s recent history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank assets are a reasonable but imperfect measure of overall credit growth in China’s economy. China technically publishes multiple statistics measuring total credit. These include the total volume of formal bank loans, as well as a broader classification called “aggregate financing to the real economy,” which most observers label total social financing (TSF). This is a very loose translation for the Chinese term, which generally refers to society-wide financing. Both bank assets and TSF include some measures of shadow banking activity, but these are distinct. Bank assets are a slightly more expansive measure of shadow banking and overall credit growth. TSF statistics include categories for undiscounted bankers’ acceptances, loans from trust companies, and entrusted loans, which are corporate-to-corporate loans. Undiscounted bankers’ acceptances are usually correlated with shadow banking activity, but the statistic is not a direct measure of shadow lending, as it can also reflect short-term changes in interest rates or temporary liquidity crunches within the banking system. Trust loans and entrusted loans are generally considered to represent shadow banking loans, but they are only limited categories of these loans. The trust loans statistic within PBOC TSF data is generally thought to be smaller than the overall volume of trust loans extended in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank assets data released by the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) and the PBOC under the Balance Sheet of Other Depository Corporations are slightly more expansive in covering different categories of credit than the PBOC’s TSF measure. Bank assets include categories for banks’ claims on other banks, which were often used to hide shadow banking assets as collateral until the practice was regulated more stringently in 2014. The data series also includes banks’ claims on other financial institutions, which can include NBFIs. This series included many of the different asset forms that banks used to circumvent regulatory controls, including trust beneficiary rights, directional asset management plans, and investment receivables. As this asset transformation was a key part of the expansion of shadow banking from 2014 to 2016, a measure that incorporates these claims is slightly more accurate, if still incomplete. When asset growth started slowing in late 2017 and 2018, bank assets showed a sharper decline than TSF, largely because TSF did not capture as large a proportion of informal financing activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the slowdown in credit growth occurred in the informal banking channels and lending to China’s corporate sector. Within banks’ assets, these loans were particularly concentrated in banks’ claims on third-party financial institutions and NBFIs, which were central to shadow banking activity. Banks’ claims on other banks, combined with their claims on NBFIs, shifted from an annual expansion of 9.9 trillion yuan ($1.5 trillion) in 2015 and 9.0 trillion yuan ($1.3 trillion) in 2016 to an outright annual contraction of 451 billion yuan in 2017 and a whopping 3.1 trillion yuan ($449 billion) in 2018. This was the primary reason that overall new bank asset growth slowed from 31.2 trillion yuan ($4.6 trillion) in 2016 to only 19.3 trillion yuan ($2.8 trillion) in 2017 and 17.0 trillion yuan ($2.5 trillion) in 2018. A combined measure of lending to corporations, in addition to corporate bond issuance and shadow banking claims, rose by only 4 percent by early 2018, the lowest rate of growth in history. This same measure had surged by an average of 18.3 percent from 2012 to 2016. As the charts show, these were significant changes in overall credit growth and lending activity across China’s economy. Basically, corporate credit growth was cut by more than half, and many borrowers found themselves suddenly cut off from financing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 4.2 shows the changes in the composition of banks’ total assets over time. As the deleveraging campaign intensified, some of the channels for shadow banking activity — banks’ claims on NBFIs and claims on other banks — shrank considerably, while loan assets increased. Informal banking activity went from being the most important marginal driver of credit growth within the system in 2015–16 to the most significant drag on asset growth by 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/KXVCF5r.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;contraction-in-non-deposit-liabilities-and-wmps&quot;&gt;Contraction in Non-deposit Liabilities and WMPs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall credit growth slowed considerably in 2017 and 2018, in part because funding for shadow banking assets had dried up as short-term money market rates rose and became more volatile. Regulatory pressure on WMPs was generally successful in reducing banks’ issuance of these products, which meant that many financial institutions were forced to rely upon more traditional deposits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shadow banking expanded from 2012 to 2016, banks saw a steady decline in their reliance upon deposits as a proportion of overall funding (Figure 4.3). This ratio fell sharply from 79.6 percent in 2012 to 71.4 percent in 2017 (with 250 trillion yuan [$36.8 trillion] in banking system liabilities at the end of 2017, each percentage point represented a 2.5 trillion yuan [$370 billion] decline in deposits). But as informal financing channels and reliance upon interbank funding shrank, deposits became more important within banks’ overall funding, and the ratio rose quickly in 2018, ascending to 74.6 percent in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/igct8i7.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, monetary tightening steps and higher interest rates dramatically reduced the growth and importance of interbank financing in China’s money markets. The proportion of interbank liabilities relative to total bank liabilities among surveyed banks remained stable following the introduction of the deleveraging campaign, dropping from a peak of 21.5 percent in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interbank deposits from other banks, which had been used to allow smaller banks to compete for funding at higher rates, dropped sharply, from 19.2 trillion yuan ($2.8 trillion) in 2016 to 16.1 trillion yuan ($2.4 trillion) in 2018. For a while, this financing was replaced by interbank NCDs, which show up in Figure 4.4 as interbank bonds. But the net result of the deleveraging campaign was to freeze interbank financing as a marginal driver of new shadow banking growth within China’s financial system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/qynR4fD.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 4.4: Contributors to Interbank Funding in China’s Banks, 2012–2021.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Banks’ annual reports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, regulatory tightening measures and requirements that WMP investments be marked to market value caused banks to dramatically scale back issuance of new WMPs. The balance of WMPs contracted outright from 23.1 trillion yuan ($3.4 trillion) in 2016 to 22.0 trillion yuan ($3.2 trillion) by 2018 (Figure 4.5). Basically, this meant existing WMP funding was being rolled over, but these instruments were not being used as a marginal source of new funding within the financial system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, in 2020 and 2021, WMP issuance rebounded again as interbank interest rates declined. But these were primarily cash-type WMPs restricted in the types of assets in which they could invest and still subject to controls under the new asset management rules introduced in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/HbWMOot.png&quot; alt=&quot;image12&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned previously, many banks attempted to bypass regulatory guidance on WMPs by introducing higher-interest deposits labeled as “structured deposits.” These were often used as vehicles for arbitrage, in which low-cost borrowing from the money markets when rates were low could be redeposited into other banks’ structured deposits at a profit. As the deleveraging effort continued in 2020 and 2021, regulatory scrutiny of structured deposits increased. As a result, many investors had no choice but to shift savings back into more traditional long-term time deposits, which had seen no significant reduction in interest rates since the deleveraging campaign launched (Figure 4.6). With banks reducing issuance of WMPs and more WMPs bearing losses in investments that investors could see transparently, time deposits became the much safer alternative. As a result, banks started relying upon deposits for a far greater proportion of overall funding starting in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall trend from 2016 to 2019, the most intense period of China’s deleveraging campaign, was to reduce reliance upon non-deposit sources of funding such as WMPs. Banks’ liabilities became much clearer to regulators and investors and shifted back toward more traditional deposits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;shadow-banking-assets-migrate-back-to-loans&quot;&gt;Shadow Banking Assets Migrate Back to Loans&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the asset side of banks’ balance sheets, the effect of the deleveraging campaign was similar. With shadow funding instruments contracting, banks needed to move loans back to formal balance sheets. This caused banks to fully account for these loans within capital risk weightings and contributed to slower asset growth as well. As a result, formal bank loans rose consistently as a proportion of surveyed banks’ overall assets, from 46.3 percent in 2016 to 55.4 percent in 2021 (Figure 4.7). Once again, the deleveraging campaign’s start in 2016 was the critical inflection point in banks’ management of their balance sheets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/AODsmzv.png&quot; alt=&quot;image14&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 4.7: Total Loans and Proportion of Total Bank Assets, 2012–2021.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Banks’ annual reports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banks used several different classifications of assets for their channel business in raising funds from depositors and placing them with NBFIs and other shadow banks or asset managers. Some of these included trust beneficiary rights, in which the bank did not keep the loan on its balance sheet, only a beneficiary right to the interest income. Others included investment receivables and directional asset management plans, in which loans were reclassified as investments or asset management plans. As Figure 4.8 shows, these assets skyrocketed in popularity from 2012 to 2016, rising from 4.8 percent to 18.3 percent of total bank assets. However, the deleveraging campaign dramatically affected the attractiveness of these assets, and they subsequently dropped to 12.2 percent of total assets in only two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the accounting treatment of these assets changed under a new accounting standard labeled International Financial Reporting Standard 9, banks stopped reporting these assets as investment receivables, as they would have needed to account for additional credit losses within these instruments, which explains why the data series stops in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/EDK6BNg.png&quot; alt=&quot;image15&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 4.8: Total Investment Receivables and Proportion of Total Assets, 2012–2018.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Banks’ annual reports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the PBOC’s official data, these non-loan assets or other forms of shadow credit were often counted within a category labeled “shares and other investments” for banks, as a category for uses of banks’ funds, similar to loans (Figure 4.9). This more comprehensive monthly data series clearly shows the rapid rise of shadow banking channels from 2011 to 2016, when the category of shares and other investments rose by an astonishing 20.8 trillion yuan (around $3.0 trillion at 2016 exchange rates) and represented a peak of 12.9 percent of the total uses of funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outright peak in this series indicating shadow banking activity was reached in February 2017, after the deleveraging campaign had started. By 2021, these were around half of the peak proportion of banks’ uses of funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also data series available from NBFIs, who were often the final lenders or the agents within the shadow banking system. A combination of data sources from the industry associations linked to these institutions can create a reasonable proxy for the total assets of NBFIs on an annual basis, even if this is likely conservative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total NBFI assets skyrocketed between 2013 and 2016, rising by an estimated 51 trillion yuan ($7.3 trillion). This is roughly in line with previous estimates of total informal financing growth within formal banks’ asset books of 36.7 trillion yuan ($5.4 trillion) from 2012 to 2016. Most significantly, these assets contracted meaningfully in 2017 and 2018, led by the trust sector, which often lent to property developers and local government financing vehicles (LGFVs) (Figure 4.10).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The regulatory tightening campaign also drove banks and asset managers to change how they allocated funds raised within WMPs. Data from Chinawealth.com.cn, the government website for WMP products, show how WMP assets changed over the course of the deleveraging effort (Figure 4.11). The total proportion of nonstandard credit assets, or those usually associated with shadow banking loans, fell from 27.5 percent in 2013 to only 8.4 percent in 2021. Similarly, the proportion of safer assets, including bonds, continued rising, finally reaching 68.4 percent of WMP assets in 2021. The levels of cash and bank deposits also include interbank bank deposits and placements of funds with other banks, which were regulated more stringently starting in 2017. As a result, the proportion of these assets also declined under the deleveraging campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the net effect of the deleveraging campaign was to clarify banks’ shadow banking exposures, moving more assets back to the formal loan book. Similarly, most measures of informal or shadow banking loans rose very quickly from 2012 to 2016 and, upon the introduction of the deleveraging campaign, began contracting in 2017 and 2018. The net effect was to shine a light on more, but not all, of banks’ riskier lending practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;differentiation-in-credit-growth-across-provinces&quot;&gt;Differentiation in Credit Growth across Provinces&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the more important implications of the deleveraging campaign was the way it changed the geographic distribution of economic growth in China and accelerated differences in financial conditions across different provinces and regions. Because some provincial governments had relied upon LGFVs and shadow banking channels more heavily than others, when those channels contracted, some provinces posted considerable slowdowns in overall credit growth. This weakened local government investment within those localities and forced them to rely more heavily upon local government special revenue bonds (SRBs) for fiscal support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 4.12 shows how regional patterns of credit distribution changed considerably after the introduction of the deleveraging campaign. Before the campaign, from 2014 to 2018, credit growth in northeastern provinces (considered China’s rust belt) and western provinces actually outpaced overall credit growth and the loans extended in eastern and southeastern coastal provinces. By 2018, this pattern of credit distribution changed fundamentally. Since the end of 2018, credit growth across the northeastern and western provinces has averaged only 4 percent, compared to 13 percent in the coastal southeast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/sKGnyQ2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image19&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of this differentiation can be explained by the shift toward mortgage lending within the financial system and the fact that property markets were more vibrant and prices higher in the southeastern coastal provinces, where the population was still growing. But overall, it shows a change in the financial system’s willingness to extend credit in riskier regions of the economy, where growth prospects were weaker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the slowdown in credit in interior provinces demonstrates how the deleveraging campaign introduced new credit risks into China’s financial system, based on the perceived credit quality of the local government involved in guaranteeing or supporting different types of assets. This geographic counterparty risk became more important as more local government state-owned enterprises (SOEs) started to default, which effectively cut off entire provinces from financing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;defaults-rise-sharply-as-credit-risk-emerges&quot;&gt;Defaults Rise Sharply as Credit Risk Emerges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deleveraging campaign also accelerated the introduction of credit risks and default risks into China’s financial system, even though this process was already underway. From 2012 to 2016, China’s shadow banking system expanded rapidly because many investors assumed that losses were almost impossible and that, if widespread financial distress became a possibility, Beijing would intervene and calm markets, minimizing losses. Investors and market participants did not need to limit their own risks before 2016 because they could count on the fact that Beijing was concerned about the political effects of financial instability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deleveraging campaign broke down the assumption of moral hazard within the financial system in two ways. First, by declaring war against shadow banking institutions, Beijing clearly indicated a changing set of political preferences in which shadow financing channels were considered riskier. This forced investors to contemplate the possibility that Beijing might not offer concrete support for the riskiest credit channels within the financial system, such as P2P lending networks and trust companies. Once that possibility of default emerged in certain asset classes, the leap to other assets potentially defaulting was much smaller. As a result, investors and markets needed to start considering which informal financial institutions bore credit risk, and they reduced investments accordingly. This helped to accelerate the contraction of the shadow banking sector in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, by reducing aggregate credit growth, particularly within shadow financing channels, the deleveraging campaign reduced the refinancing possibilities for many types of borrowers, who were suddenly cut off from credit. Even if Beijing had wanted to send alternative political signals that certain borrowers were safe, the reduction in credit growth would have generated additional defaults and credit risk. This was particularly common within China’s corporate bond market, where the first sharp rise in defaults took place in the second half of 2018, when overall credit growth declined sharply (Figure 4.13). Defaults on corporate bonds continued in later years and spread to new borrowers, including local government SOEs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/uLIgbSD.png&quot; alt=&quot;image20&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 4.13: Monthly Corporate Bond Defaults, Onshore Market, March 2014–December 2021.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Rhodium Group Corporate Bond Default Database.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the borrowers who were defaulting were typically from industries serviced by shadow banking institutions, including LGFVs and property developers (Figure 4.14). Defaults were concentrated in the capital goods and materials sectors, along with utilities, in 2018 and 2019. Then, defaults in the property sector became much more common in 2020 and 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/LCbHE4X.png&quot; alt=&quot;image21&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This introduction of credit risk within China’s financial system set the stage for the end of China’s decade-long credit bubble. Once lenders needed to consider the possibility of default, fewer and fewer asset classes and industries were considered creditworthy. As those industries slowed along with the broader economy, credit demand dried up as well. One of the deleveraging campaign’s most significant impacts was the introduction of credit risk in several asset classes, which gradually broke down the widespread assumption of moral hazard and implicit government guarantees across China’s financial system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-changed-financial-system&quot;&gt;A Changed Financial System&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of three years, from 2016 to 2018, the deleveraging campaign redirected China’s financial system in several ways. Shadow banking channels contracted, which forced banks to search for more stable deposit funding. Loans that could no longer be funded by shadow banking institutions and banks’ channel business migrated back to the formal loan book. This had the effect of increasing transparency within China’s banking system and improved the overall stability of the funding base for banks. The contraction in shadow banking channels caused the overall pace of credit growth to slow significantly, by far more than Beijing had intended. In part this was because the actual size of the shadow banking system had been obscured from regulators’ view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the deleveraging campaign introduced new changes in the patterns of credit distribution within China. Certain localities in China’s northeastern and western provinces were hit much harder than others from the slowdown in credit growth, while coastal southeastern provinces retained their access to credit. Defaults became far more probable in riskier financial assets and started spreading to corporate bonds and SOEs as well. Smaller banks, such as Baoshang Bank and the Bank of Jinzhou, defaulted based on their exposure to riskier forms of lending concentrated within certain localities. Banks started to differentiate lending patterns across localities and across asset classes as credit risk became much more acute relative to a baseline in which almost all assets were assumed to be guaranteed and losses were improbable. This redirection of China’s financial system had meaningful effects on the real economy as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;deleveraging-and-chinas-economy&quot;&gt;Deleveraging and China’s Economy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the deleveraging campaign’s impact on China’s financial system, the real economy was bound to feel its effects. Beijing’s bargain and hope was that deleveraging could simply “skim the froth” of the speculative activity within China’s financial markets without affecting borrowers in the broader economy. But cutting credit growth roughly in half meant that many borrowers suddenly found themselves cut off from financing and needing to scramble for alternative options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effects of the deleveraging campaign on China’s economy, starting around 2018 and continuing in the following years, can be summarized as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economic growth slowed by a larger margin than Beijing had anticipated.&lt;/strong&gt; The broader objective to limit financial risks without squeezing the real economy was generally unsuccessful. Shadow banks were funding real borrowers in China’s economy as well as financial speculation. While headline GDP growth barely moved during the deleveraging campaign, most indicators of industrial output contracted outright in the second half of 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The property bubble reinflated because credit was reallocated to mortgage loans for households, which used credit to buy houses before they were constructed.&lt;/strong&gt; The deleveraging campaign encouraged banks to seek out borrowers willing to pay higher interest rates, which were primarily home buyers taking out mortgage loans. As property developers were forced to repay shadow banking debt, they often used preconstruction housing sales to do so, replacing borrowing from shadow banks with borrowing from leveraged home buyers. This transition explains the continued growth of China’s property bubble and developers’ financing shortfalls, which made them unable to complete houses sold in 2021 and 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China’s private sector was affected most by the decline in overall credit, reducing business investment.&lt;/strong&gt; Overall credit growth slowed significantly in 2017 and 2018, largely because of the slowdown in shadow banking channels. As loans to China’s corporate sector contracted, state-owned enterprises (SOEs) largely preserved their access to financing, while private sector firms were squeezed disproportionately, reducing the overall efficiency of investment in the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inflation dropped meaningfully as corporate credit slowed, and low- and middle-income households lost access to financing from shadow banks, reducing consumer spending.&lt;/strong&gt; Ever since the deleveraging campaign started to impact shadow financing channels, China’s core consumer price inflation has remained below 1 percent, indicating the slowdown in consumer credit growth caused by the collapse of peer-to-peer (P2P) lending networks and other informal financial channels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fiscal strains within China’s local governments increased significantly, requiring more assistance from Beijing.&lt;/strong&gt; The pressure on local governments to repay implicit debt, along with the decline in the property market, significantly weakened localities’ capacity to repay their obligations. New fiscal tools such as local government special revenue bonds (SRBs) became necessary to maintain infrastructure investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-credit-induced-slowdown-in-output-and-investment&quot;&gt;A Credit-Induced Slowdown in Output and Investment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deleveraging campaign caused overall credit growth to slow from 15.7 percent in 2015 and 2016 to only 8.4 percent in 2017 and 6.8 percent in 2018 (measured via bank assets). This basically meant that credit growth was cut in half in a very short timeframe. For corporate borrowers, the squeeze was even more extreme, as some new lending was also being redirected to China’s households. Many borrowers, unable to refinance, were forced to make difficult choices about reducing output and investment or financing investment out of profit or operating cash flows. Many state-owned corporations and local government financing vehicles (LGFVs), however, engaged in quasi-fiscal investments that had very weak operating cash flows and profitability. They depended on new credit to maintain activity. As a result, when credit growth slowed, the overall pace of output growth slowed as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the slowdown in output growth in 2018 was readily apparent in some Chinese data series but not others (Figure 5.1). Headline GDP growth is notoriously “smoothed” in China, and over the course of 2018, this measure barely slowed at all, from 6.9 percent growth in the first quarter to 6.5 percent growth in the fourth quarter. GDP growth rates in China over the four-year period from 2015 to 2018 were the smoothest of any major economy in at least 30–40 years (given data availability questions), never moving outside a range of 6.5–7.1 percent growth. Industrial value-added growth in China, an indicator of real output and an input into official GDP calculations, was only slightly more volatile, falling from 7.0 percent growth in April 2018 to 5.4 percent growth in November.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other subcomponents, however, pointed to a much more severe slump. Auto sales had shown a 16 percent decline by November and December. Output of major household durables and white goods such as refrigerators and washing machines started to contract in late 2018, along with other consumer goods. Property developers started to slow construction of houses they had already sold in order to retain cash, and house completions declined by 8 percent in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to look at a broader measure of industrial output, the Rhodium China Activity Tracker (R-CAT) takes a weighted average of unit-level monthly output of all 103 industrial output series released by the National Bureau of Statistics (Figure 5.2). The indicators are then seasonally adjusted and weighted based on proxies for their importance within the economy, using revenue of major enterprises and tax revenues. The net result showed that aggregate weighted industrial output had fallen by 6–7 percent year over year in the third quarter of 2018, with the most significant declines occurring in output of consumer goods. These were the largest declines in overall output until the Covid-19 pandemic hit in early 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/3L6VnUf.png&quot; alt=&quot;image23&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other indicators of aggregate economic activity showed similar declines. An alternative measure used by the U.S. Federal Reserve in evaluating the effects of a changing credit impulse on China’s economy similarly showed a meaningful cyclical downturn in 2018. This was also consistent with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) ’s shift toward monetary easing at the time. Overall, official Chinese data tend to smooth out the impact of the business cycle, but a variety of alternative indicators point to the importance of cyclical trends, particularly in 2018. The deleveraging campaign had a meaningful effect on economic momentum in China, even if the intention of the campaign was simply to limit speculative activity in financial markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reinflating-the-property-bubble&quot;&gt;Reinflating the Property Bubble&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Property development has always been an industry heavily dependent upon credit growth. Yet when credit growth slowed sharply during the deleveraging campaign, the property sector grew, and the housing bubble became even larger, both in terms of new construction and prices. This was one of the most surprising consequences of the campaign itself. Property developers replaced financing from shadow banks with financing from leveraged home buyers in the form of housing purchases made before construction was complete. The effects of the deleveraging campaign also created the conditions for the more significant collapse of China’s housing market in 2021 and 2022. The developers that defaulted first in 2021 and 2022 were generally those that were most aggressive in leveraging up in 2017 and 2018, when the property sector was under pressure from the contracting shadow banking sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s residential housing market rapidly developed in the 2000s, mostly involving new construction from developers, while secondary market sales were slower to take off. Prices rose considerably as China’s urbanization rates and household incomes surged over the decade along with economic growth. Developers were incentivized to borrow aggressively and expand quickly, which involved bidding up prices for land. Setbacks in the housing market in 2008, 2011, and 2014 were very short-lived, and expectations for continued price growth remained strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One consequence of this history of rapid price growth was that developers could typically find buyers easily and could impose additional requirements on Chinese home buyers that other markets likely would not have been able to bear. As a result, developers were often able to collect 100 percent of the purchase price of homes based on floor plans alone after initially breaking ground on land. Home buyers would even start paying mortgages on properties they had not yet received. Developers increasingly came to rely on preconstruction sales of housing as a source of revenue. This was possible because home buyers believed housing values would generally rise, so they were less concerned about when exactly their final properties would be delivered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deleveraging campaign initially squeezed property developers’ financial conditions by restricting shadow financing channels. Property developers were among the largest borrowers from several types of nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs), particularly trust companies. When those channels of lending evaporated in 2017 and 2018, many property developers needed to preserve cash. Yu Liang, the head of Vanke, China’s largest real estate developer at the time, said the real estate market was at a “turning point” and emphasized that his goal for the company in 2018 was that it “survives.” Other large developers, such as Evergrande, were far less cautious in 2018 and continued to borrow aggressively and acquire land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Property developers changed their business model in two ways in order to ensure survival. First, they slowed construction on houses already in progress. This reduced immediate costs and outlays for these firms but also weakened China’s commodity demand and slowed the economy more broadly. This was partially responsible for the decline in consumer durables and white goods in 2018 because fewer houses were being completed, so people did not need as many appliances to fill their homes. Similarly, auto sales slowed, as these were typically correlated with property sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rdoIBHf.png&quot; alt=&quot;image24&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 5.3: Growth in Property Sales, Starts, Completions, and Sales of Existing Houses, 2016–2022.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: National Bureau of Statistics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, developers started relying upon preconstruction sales to generate additional revenues. This was very attractive to home builders because their cash outlays to prepare projects for sale were extremely limited, but then developers were obligated to eventually complete these units. As a result, throughout the deleveraging campaign, a strange divergence occurred in China’s housing market. New starts surged, rising by 20 percent in 2018, but sales of completed houses plummeted, declining by 26 percent in terms of floor space during the year (Figure 5.3). While total sales were weakening in 2017 and 2018, sales of preconstructed houses were still rising by 10 percent in 2018 in terms of floor space and an astonishing 22 percent in terms of revenue (Figure 5.4).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, developers had shifted one form of credit to another, from borrowing from shadow lenders to borrowing from home buyers. Now they were responsible for delivering rising numbers of homes. This process also introduced some Ponzi-type elements of financing into China’s property sector, as the rush to raise money from presales was likely necessary because shadow banking loans were being called in. These loans were often high-interest, and many developers may have been pledging revenues for future home construction in order to repay legacy debt to shadow banks. In most markets, these proceeds for future construction were placed in escrow accounts, so there was little chance that home buyers could face defaults. However, as discovered when the housing market imploded in 2021 and 2022, the regulatory structure for China’s housing market was lax in enforcement, particularly among local governments, which had incentives to encourage property developers to expand aggressively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/I5Du05G.png&quot; alt=&quot;image25&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 5.4: Developer Sales of Presold Units and Existing/Completed Units, June 2012–February 2019.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: National Bureau of Statistics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deleveraging campaign also redirected more lending to home buyers in the form of mortgage loans. Banks wanted to extend loans to higher-interest borrowers, which were suddenly scarce because of the crackdown on shadow banking. A survey of banks’ results showed that the proportion of property-related lending, including mortgages and loans to developers, rose to 33 percent in 2018 from 24 percent in 2014 (Figure 5.5). This was contrary to the objectives of the broader deleveraging campaign to reduce systemic risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because housing prices were still rising, many home buyers were still willing to borrow in anticipation of further price appreciation. Total new household loans reached 7.3 trillion yuan in 2018 ($1.1 trillion), almost matching total corporate lending of 8.3 trillion yuan ($1.2 trillion). The pace of mortgage lending slowed in later years, but loans to households stayed in the same range of 6 to 8 trillion yuan per year from 2019 to 2021. This was an enormous volume of fuel for speculation in China’s housing market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/3MPMTB9.png&quot; alt=&quot;image26&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, China saw one form of housing bubble — an excess of construction — replaced with another, a credit bubble from households to developers based on the promises of future construction. From the end of 2015 to June 2021, the total annual volume of presales revenues for developers nearly tripled, from 5.8 trillion yuan ($850 billion) to a peak of 16.3 trillion yuan ($2.4 trillion) (Figure 5.6). This credit expansion intensified during the deleveraging campaign, and its reversal created the credit crunch that would produce the spectacular collapse of China’s housing market in 2021 and 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-private-sector-is-squeezed&quot;&gt;The Private Sector Is Squeezed&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s private sector has always faced difficulties in borrowing from the formal banking system. Loan officers in China have typically extended loans based on either government guarantees to SOEs or based on collateral. Private firms do not boast direct government support and typically have weaker asset bases. As a result, when they access credit from China’s banks, they typically pay higher interest rates, sometimes by paying fees to credit guarantee companies or by seeking other forms of credit enhancement. In turn, these firms are typically far more efficient in generating returns relative to SOEs, so they are capable of paying higher interest rates. The other consequence is that lending to the private sector tends to be shorter term, usually involving loans for working capital rather than project-based lending for investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the deleveraging campaign reduced overall corporate credit growth, mechanically this had a disproportionate impact on China’s private sector. Beijing’s approach to encouraging the private sector has ebbed and flowed over the years, with the common phrase guo jin min tui (“the state advances and the private sector retreats”) frequently used to describe conditions for private firms in the 2010s. When overall credit growth slows, state-owned firms typically maintain access to the banking system because of their political ties. The debt servicing needs of these firms have continued to rise as the volume of debt has expanded and interest costs have risen. As a result, the squeeze in overall lending in 2017 and 2018 tended to reduce credit to the private sector to a greater extent than credit to state-owned firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As banks lost access to financing, they needed to make more difficult choices in extending new loans, which usually meant private-sector firms lost access to working capital loans. Xu Gao, then with Everbright Securities, commented on this trend in 2019: “In an environment where credit is tightening, financing constraints of private enterprises are tightened even more, which makes the operating conditions of private enterprises worse than those of SOEs. This in turn strengthens risk aversion of financial institutions toward private enterprises, further tightening financing conditions for private firms.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After years of abundant financing from 2014 to 2017, net corporate bond issuance by private enterprises was negative most of the time after 2018 while SOEs’ net bond issuance remained at high levels (Figure 5.7). This resulted in a clear slowdown in industrial output of these firms, new investment, and job growth, given that private firms are responsible for around 80 percent of China’s overall urban employment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/00zmuuI.png&quot; alt=&quot;image28&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 5.7: Net Corporate Bond Issuance by State-Owned and Private Firms, January 2009–October 2022.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: WIND.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The introduction of new credit risks was also problematic for private firms. As banks started to face defaults and losses on lending through NBFIs and third-party financial institutions, loan officers concerned about credit risk naturally pared back lending to the private sector. P2P lending networks were highly speculative but were involved in lending to smaller firms, even at high interest rates. The defaults and implosions of these platforms reversed some of private firms’ gains in access to financing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the private sector, the broader slowdown in credit growth was a painful process because credit expansions do not necessarily benefit the private sector as much as credit crunches hurt private firms. Typically, countercyclical monetary policies involve incentivizing new investment projects through credit to state-owned firms and local governments. Eventually, there are spillover effects into the business environment for the private sector, but this requires time for the broader economy to improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deleveraging campaign and the corresponding structural slowdown in credit growth have created a much more restrictive financing environment for China’s private firms relative to the years of rapid credit expansion from 2009 to 2016. This will naturally reduce the overall efficiency of China’s financial system and reduce the productivity of new investment in China’s economy, weakening overall economic growth over the next decade, unless more significant structural reforms reverse this pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;downshift-in-inflationary-pressures&quot;&gt;Downshift in Inflationary Pressures&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as private sector firms were cut off from credit as some financing channels contracted under deleveraging, China’s low- and middle-income consumers were similarly squeezed. Mortgage lending expanded significantly under the deleveraging campaign and fueled additional property sales, as previously discussed. But the collapse of P2P lenders and other shadow financing channels ended up closing some channels for household borrowing that had recently opened for lower-income households. Higher household borrowing to repay mortgage debt, in combination with reduced access to overall credit, ended up constraining household consumption growth in China following deleveraging. As a result, China has yet to see any meaningful consumer inflationary pressure since the deleveraging campaign, with core consumer price index (CPI) growth (excluding food and energy prices) trending downward consistently since 2018 and staying roughly around 1 percent for the past five years (Figure 5.8).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/oeUAI6t.png&quot; alt=&quot;image29&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when credit was expanding strongly in China from 2012 to 2016, the economy saw no meaningful inflationary pressures. Household income as a proportion of China’s economy remains extremely low, around 55 percent of GDP, in part because of the structure of China’s growth model. For years, low wages or household incomes were necessary to improve the competitiveness of China’s exports and to reduce barriers to new investment. The limitations on income have similarly constrained a rise in household consumption and consumer prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only rise in CPI above 3 percent in recent years has been the consequence of a significant disease in China’s hog population, which ended up severely limiting pork supply and pushing up prices temporarily. In part, low inflation also results from most new credit in China’s financial system being channeled to producers, even when demand weakens. The net result of this process, even during the years of strong credit growth from 2012 to 2016, was persistent deflationary pressure in producer prices as output continued expanding, with no strong pickup in consumer prices. The property market’s rebound in 2016 and 2017 generated some additional producer price pressure, along with the rise in commodity prices in 2021. But there has been no meaningful rise in consumer prices in China, indicating ongoing limitations on household income growth. The deleveraging campaign indirectly reinforced these processes, weakening consumers’ access to credit and introducing new caution concerning the broader economic outlook. This has reduced overall inflationary pressures within China’s economy, as evidenced by the sustained slowdown in core CPI growth since 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;fiscal-pressures-on-local-governments&quot;&gt;Fiscal Pressures on Local Governments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most significant impacts of the deleveraging campaign in China’s economy was its effect on local government fiscal conditions. Deleveraging pressured some of localities’ revenue channels directly but also compounded their problems in managing a rising debt burden. As a result, many local governments struggled to maintain infrastructure investment growth following the deleveraging campaign, and overall infrastructure spending has downshifted considerably since 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deleveraging placed new pressure on property developers’ finances, which ended up meaningfully reducing their capacity to buy new land from local governments. Instead, developers were more eager to start projects from their existing land banks. As a result, growth in land sales slowed sharply in 2018 and 2019. Given that developers typically have a year to make payments to local governments for land parcels, the effect of this slowdown in land purchases lagged over a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the deleveraging campaign added to localities’ difficulties in managing debt. Many local governments had relied heavily upon LGFVs and shadow banking activity to fund investment. With those channels contracting, localities were forced to reduce new infrastructure investment but still needed to manage the legacy debt, which was more difficult to refinance and required spending from general government funds. In addition, part of the deleveraging effort included pressure on local governments to pay down implicit debt over a period of three to five years. Local governments needed to start considering other options such as selling state assets or privatization. Managing debt became a far more urgent priority as overall credit growth declined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defaults among local government SOEs became more common as a result of these pressures, even before the downturn in China’s property market. When the Henan provincial government reorganized the priorities of Yongcheng Coal, shifting funds that were allocated to repay bond investors toward other uses, the resulting November 2020 default on the bonds forced markets to consider localities as a source of risk for the first time rather than think about local government guarantees as a bulwark of stability. After Yongcheng Coal’s default, concerns about local government actions prevented any other firm from Henan province from issuing debt in China’s corporate bond market for over a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pressure on local government fiscal conditions has primarily been revealed through weaker infrastructure spending. Infrastructure investment growth as measured via fixed asset investment grew by only 3.8 percent in 2018 and 2019, 0.9 percent in 2020, and 0.4 percent in 2021, before rebounding in 2022. Local governments’ deteriorating fiscal balances and declining land sales revenues forced them to become more reliant upon a new channel for government borrowing: local government SRBs. In 2015, local governments reported a deficit in their fund budget for the first time (Figure 5.9). This fund budget consists of land sales revenues and spending categories that include the costs of redeveloping land for sale, as well as other categories of expenses separate from official budgetary spending. SRBs were first introduced to provide financing for the deficit in the fund budget, and issuance quickly expanded in the years ahead as deficits ballooned. Technically, these bonds are designed to fund only infrastructure projects and are not supposed to be used for general fiscal spending. But a significant proportion of the bonds issued from 2018 to 2022, usually around 20–30 percent, has been used for refinancing existing local government debt burdens. The Ministry of Finance imposes restrictions on the types of projects that must be funded with these SRBs so they do not add to implicit debts of localities. Because fewer projects met those criteria, the ministry was forced to relax some of these restrictions in early 2022, with infrastructure investment growth still under pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-deleveraging-campaign-and-chinas-economy&quot;&gt;The Deleveraging Campaign and China’s Economy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deleveraging campaign’s changes in the financial system extended to China’s real economy. The broader slowdown in credit clearly affected economic growth and squeezed private sector borrowing channels. The pressure on local governments’ implicit debts weakened local fiscal conditions and reduced infrastructure investment growth. Controls on consumer credit and employment prospects also reduced overall inflationary pressure in the economy. All of these effects were generally expected given the reliance of China’s economy on credit and investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most surprising and unexpected developments, however, was that the deleveraging campaign ended up inflating China’s property market bubble further by replacing one form of borrowing from shadow banks with a larger channel of borrowing from households. As a result, the campaign ended up meaningfully amplifying one of the most important systemic risks in China’s economy and financial system. This risk started materializing in the summer of 2021 and into 2022 as property construction and sales plummeted, meaningfully weakening economic growth. The consequences for the financial system are still emerging, and it can be argued that the property bubble would have burst or deflated anyway, regardless of Beijing’s actions. But both the expected and unanticipated implications are necessary to make a broader assessment of China’s deleveraging campaign, based on Beijing’s original objectives and the actual impact on China’s longer-term economic trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;assessing-chinas-deleveraging-campaign&quot;&gt;Assessing China’s Deleveraging Campaign&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current slowdown in China’s property sector and the emergence of local government fiscal risks raise the question of how to assess the costs and benefits of the deleveraging campaign more broadly. The campaign contained some specific financial risks on the funding side of banks’ balance sheets while catalyzing new credit risks on the asset side. The balance is meaningful, and this chapter’s assessment of the deleveraging campaign’s successes and failures is based on the criteria that Beijing established for reducing systemic risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;credit-moral-hazard-and-chinas-economic-growth&quot;&gt;Credit, Moral Hazard, and China’s Economic Growth&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core question of the deleveraging campaign’s effectiveness concerns China’s growth model, particularly since the 2007–08 global financial crisis. One view holds that China’s rapid credit growth and expansion of debt and investment via the shadow banking system were mistakes, abetted at times by policy decisions which contributed to speculative froth in multiple asset markets. After Beijing contained those risks and curtailed the role of the shadow banking system, economic growth should have reverted to a more sustainable pace. In this view, deleveraging was an important corrective to restore China’s economy to a more stable footing and eliminate important risks within the financial system. In addition, deleveraging was necessary to reduce borrowing costs for companies engaged in real investment rather than speculative ventures by controlling the growth of shadow banks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An alternative view, however, is that credit and investment growth, encouraged by widespread moral hazard throughout the financial system, was intrinsic to China’s economic expansion since the global financial crisis. By taking strong steps to limit credit growth, including within the shadow banking system, the deleveraging campaign was also likely to bring China’s postcrisis economic expansion to an end, pointing to much weaker growth in the future. This view points to the importance of the property sector in driving China’s growth since 2008, despite Beijing’s efforts to control the growth of the industry. Excessive property investment may have been unintended, but it was also one of the most important industries in China’s economy. In this view, there was little speculative froth in China’s credit expansion; the entire pattern of investment growth that resulted was unsustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With China’s economy now under considerable pressure from the property market’s decline, the debate between these two interpretations has become far more relevant. If the financial system continues to grow at a slower pace, acting as a constraint on new investment rather than enabling economic expansion, how fast can China’s economy reasonably be expected to grow? If the property sector continues to contract, what sort of limit does this place on China’s future economic expansion? What proportion of China’s economic growth over the past decade has been structural, and what proportion has been the by-product of an unprecedented credit expansion?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deleveraging campaign has facilitated new forms of credit risk, which will limit the future expansion of China’s financial system. Moral hazard is no longer widespread across China’s financial system, even if there is still some degree of confidence that the government will intervene to prevent financial contagion. Ever since the deleveraging campaign, risky assets, starting with peer-to-peer (P2P) lending networks, began defaulting in larger numbers, and eventually, even assets considered safer, such as smaller banks, bonds from large property developers, and local government state-owned enterprises (SOEs), were taking on losses. This reduced lenders’ willingness to extend new credit to larger and larger areas of China’s financial system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the financial system has already expanded so rapidly, now holding 377 trillion yuan ($55.4 trillion) in assets or over half of global GDP, previous rates of credit growth above 15 percent are not possible, as this would involve credit growth totaling around half of China’s economic output every year, well above even the 2009 pace of new lending immediately after the global financial crisis. Credit growth will slow in the future, and GDP growth will likely slow along with it. The question is how steep the decline will be, which depends upon what other asset classes will begin to default and therefore trigger additional market concerns about credit risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the primary concerns is that local government financing vehicles (LGFVs), which have already defaulted on shadow banking instruments, will start to default on their publicly traded bonds. This would create new credit risk in around 40 percent of China’s 33 trillion yuan ($4.8 trillion) corporate bond market and would also likely reduce a significant source of credit demand for smaller banks. It would also significantly reduce local government infrastructure investment, which has been almost as large a driver of investment growth as the property sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is far more evidence that contraction in the shadow banking system has limited credit to real borrowers, not just speculative froth. As a result, as credit growth has slowed following the deleveraging campaign, China’s economic growth will appear different in the future. Marginal returns to new investment via property and local government infrastructure will not be the same as in the past, given declining credit availability. Growth will be powered by different drivers, including household consumption. Based on the economy’s performance since 2018, it will also be slower overall. The question in evaluating the deleveraging campaign becomes whether the medicine that Beijing applied was effective in treating the disease of speculative activity in the shadow banking system or whether it left the economy unable to continue sustainable economic expansion in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;analyses-of-the-deleveraging-campaign&quot;&gt;Analyses of the Deleveraging Campaign&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the campaign intensified in 2018, Beijing’s deleveraging efforts have seldom been discussed in their entirety as a multiyear policy effort using a combination of monetary and regulatory tightening measures. Usually, the campaign is mentioned in the China economics literature as a series of stand-alone actions targeting specific types of shadow banking transactions and institutions. In general, available published analyses make four types of arguments about the campaign’s effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first emphasizes the deleveraging campaign’s success as a proactive measure to eliminate an emerging systemic financial risk in 2016. As a result, the campaign is a demonstration of Chinese authorities’ effectiveness and adaptability in response to systemic challenges. Tom Orlik’s The Bubble That Never Pops features an entire chapter on the deleveraging campaign called “Deleveraging without Self-Detonating,” which generally describes the effort favorably. Orlik argues, “A year and a half into the deleveraging campaign, China’s policymakers had achieved faster growth, a steady debt-to-GDP ratio, and a shrinking shadow banking sector.” Orlik credits “the underlying resilience of the economy and financial system, the underappreciated ingenuity of policymakers, and the unusual resources of an authoritarian state” as responsible for deleveraging’s effectiveness. As a result, he argues that because shadow financing activity was mostly funding speculation in China’s financial markets rather than borrowing in the real economy, the effect of deleveraging on overall economic growth was marginal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s public accounting of the deleveraging campaign’s successes was similar in tone. The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) issued a public working paper in December 2020 discussing the broader effort to control financial risks and summarized the results as follows: “Not only has the scale of shadow banking been greatly reduced, but more importantly, operations have become more standardized, structures have been simplified . . . and systemic risks and hidden dangers have been curtailed.” Furthermore, the CBIRC’s assessment claimed that the deleveraging campaign had also reduced international criticism of China’s financial management: “After 2017, international assessments have completely changed, and now affirm the remarkable achievements of China’s governance of shadow banking, not only ensuring the stability of China’s financial system, but also becoming the driving force for the decline in global shadow banking.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second set of arguments discussing the deleveraging campaign usually comes from Chinese analysts and claims that deleveraging was overdone or excessive. These analysts flag the government’s need to relax some of the controls on shadow banking activity by the end of 2018 and push back against the extreme tightening of credit conditions, particularly for local government or the private sector. Shadow banking activity, in these arguments, was still essential for powering the economy, specifically for local governments. Some analysts with this line of reasoning argued that China’s previous accumulation of debt was not excessive and was simply a by-product of China’s growth model. Consistent with most of these accounts, Beijing started to relax its campaign to control local governments’ implicit debt levels by the end of 2018, allowing localities and LGFVs to roll over some of their own borrowing. Official local government infrastructure investment growth had plummeted from 19 percent in 2017 to 3.8 percent in 2018, triggering an adjustment from Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One example of this line of argument came from People’s Bank of China (PBOC) officials, including former research director Xu Zhong, who criticized a one-size-fits-all deleveraging process. Xu wrote in a 2019 Caixin commentary, “Cleaning up local debts has been done too hastily starting last year, and the downward pressure on the economy has led to declining local government assets, making local governments face increased risks and uncertainties.” Xu Gao from Everbright Securities made a similar argument in February 2019, claiming that the unintended effect of deleveraging was actually contrary to the policy’s original intention, boosting leverage ratios among private enterprises and tightening credit conditions among these firms through a rise in borrowing costs. The National Finance and Development Laboratory, a research institution under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, argued that deleveraging corporate balance sheets contributed to balance sheet recession risks, as reduction of overall debt levels reduced prospects for new investment. The 2021 report argues, “China’s macro leverage ratio has declined for three consecutive quarters. However, problems such as the slowing recovery of the real economy, ongoing enterprise deleveraging, and rising risks of defaults among urban investment companies may still bring hidden worries to the Chinese economy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third category of assessments generally makes the argument that deleveraging has not achieved very much at all, simply because it has not actually occurred. These analysts focus on the fact that China’s credit growth in headline terms continued expanding faster than GDP, and there was still considerable speculative activity in China’s economy underway, despite the crackdown on shadow banking activity. For the analysts in the “deleveraging did not happen” camp, business as usual continued within China’s economy and financial system, and the deleveraging campaign was ineffective despite Beijing’s high-profile attention to the subject, indicating broader policy failures. Leland Miller of China Beige Book, for example, has argued extensively that the shadow financing crackdown did not have meaningful impact on overall borrowing via informal channels in China’s financial system and that available data showed “no sign of retrenchment of either overall credit provision or shadow finance specifically” by the start of 2020. Christopher Balding made a similar case in early 2018, arguing, “Much of the financial deleveraging that has taken place has simply moved into other instruments.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fourth set of assessments is more balanced and typically retrospective in nature. Written in 2021 or 2022 rather than at the height of the deleveraging campaign in 2018, these explanations essentially argue that the campaign had some modest accomplishments in managing shadow banking risks or controlling the rise of debt-to-GDP ratios but left other problems within the financial system unaddressed. For example, Shuli Ren of Bloomberg wrote in late 2022 that the deleveraging campaign had on balance reduced financial risks in China and made it “a much safer place to put your money,” even while acknowledging the rising leverage among LGFVs and problems in managing the fallout within the property sector. Hung Tran, formerly of the International Monetary Fund, similarly argued that deleveraging is a necessary process that Beijing is managing to reduce the economy’s reliance upon credit, even if it will produce much slower economic growth in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;evaluating-the-deleveraging-campaign-on-beijings-terms&quot;&gt;Evaluating the Deleveraging Campaign on Beijing’s Terms&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are multiple arguments about the balance of costs and benefits from the deleveraging campaign, the assessment that is probably most important concerns Beijing’s priorities. Financial and economic analysts may have their own views, but Beijing had clear reasons for launching the deleveraging campaign, as outlined in Chapter 2. Beijing’s primary objectives were to eliminate the political risks that had emerged from the rapid growth of the shadow banking sector and authorities’ inability to control the financial system. Specifically, Beijing attempted to control the rising pace of credit growth and debt-to-GDP ratios, eliminate systemic risks from the shadow banking system and wealth management products (WMPs), reduce the pressures on the economy and fiscal system from local government debt, and reduce debt levels and burdens among SOEs. The section below evaluates the progress of the deleveraging campaign with reference to these specific objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slowing the Pace of Credit Growth and Limiting the Rise in Debt-to-GDP Ratios:&lt;/strong&gt; By this overarching metric, the deleveraging campaign was successful. Credit growth, as mentioned in Chapters 4 and 5, was cut roughly in half under pressure from both monetary and regulatory tightening steps. Estimated credit-to-GDP ratios, using a weighted average measure of adjusted total social financing (TSF) growth and bank asset growth, rose from 172 percent in 2008 to 261 percent at the end of 2016. By 2018, that ratio had declined to 250 percent. It continued to rise in 2020 after the Covid-19 pandemic slowed GDP growth and required emergency lending, but this was unrelated to previous efforts to control financial risks. At the start of the deleveraging campaign, the overriding question was whether or not Beijing would have the stomach to actually slow credit growth and expose Chinese companies and financial institutions to credit risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, at least some financial technocrats were willing to countenance those risks, even as they arrived in 2018. However, it was not easy to maintain political support for the slowdown in credit growth. Even though China’s top leadership had mandated deleveraging and reducing financial risks, few SOEs or local governments were willing to have their access to financing cut down. The deleveraging campaign limited shadow financing channels, which were generally larger than Beijing had anticipated. As a result, many of the borrowers from shadow banks — property developers, local governments, and their LGFVs — would have been the primary political opponents of the campaign. But shadow banks had limited direct political support. It was difficult for anyone in the Chinese system to argue that financial institutions should extend large volumes of credit outside of Beijing’s regulatory oversight. As a result, local governments and property developers were not very effective in pushing back against the newfound regulatory scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SOEs were different, though, as banks started to redirect credit toward households and away from corporations. Throughout the deleveraging campaign, household debt-to-GDP ratios rose, while corporate debt-to-GDP ratios declined. The PBOC was interested in maintaining controls on overall credit but needed to manage the internal perception that credit growth was collapsing. It is probably not a coincidence that the central bank changed its calculation methods for aggregate credit growth (TSF growth) four times over the course of the deleveraging campaign in 2018 and 2019 (Figure 6.1). All of the adjustments had the effect of boosting headline credit growth, generally by incorporating new components within TSF. These included issuance of asset-backed securities and loans written off by banks (included in July 2018) and, most controversially, central government bonds (included in December 2019), which were generally considered an instrument of fiscal policy rather than a component of credit to the nonfinancial corporate sector. While the PBOC’s motivations in adjusting the data remain unknowable, the revised data series smoothed out the overall decline in credit growth, which could be used to argue that the deleveraging campaign had not had a significant impact on preferred credit channels. The reality was that credit growth was slowing sharply in 2017 and 2018, as indicated by the decline in bank asset growth. This was consistent with Beijing’s initial objectives, even if it was difficult for the PBOC to maintain political support for its efforts across the bureaucracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 6.1: Measures of Aggregate Credit Growth, before and after TSF Data Revisions, January 2007–July 2022.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Peoples’s Bank of China.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eliminating Systemic Risks from Shadow Banking Activities and WMPs:&lt;/strong&gt; The deleveraging campaign made significant progress in reducing the risk China’s banks would suffer from a funding squeeze similar to the June 2013 interbank market crisis. Efforts to control the shadow banking sector took aim not only at the shadow lenders but also at the funding instruments themselves. Regulations designed to mark the assets of WMPs to market prices informed investors that losses on such products were possible, which reduced their attractiveness and overall issuance volumes. As a result, banks no longer relied as heavily upon WMPs as a source of funding, so there was a much smaller risk that banks could not roll over a significant funding channel if money market conditions tightened considerably. Even though negotiable certificates of deposit (NCDs) and structured deposits became much more prominent financing tools for banks replacing WMPs, they were also targeted by subsequent regulatory measures that were generally effective in limiting their growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, shadow banking assets contracted outright by virtually any measure in 2017 and 2018. This was clearly revealed within the official bank assets data, though the data do not comprehensively cover all shadow banking channels, as discussed previously. The CBIRC working paper reviewing the accomplishments of the deleveraging campaign claimed that, by the end of 2019, a broad measure of shadow banking assets had declined by 16 trillion yuan ($2.4 trillion) since the end of 2017, whereas a narrow measure was down by around 12 trillion yuan ($1.8 trillion) from its peak. By any reasonable metric, China’s shadow banking sector — the trust companies, asset management companies, brokerages with custody of bank loans, and P2P lenders — was much smaller and posed less of a systemic risk to China’s financial system than before the deleveraging campaign began in 2016. This was a clear success on the basis of Beijing’s original objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The caveat is that this success in containing shadow banking activity did not necessarily translate into minimizing systemic financial risks. By controlling one form of risk on the funding side of banks’ balance sheets, the deleveraging campaign clearly contributed to credit risks on the other side of the balance sheet, as borrowers were increasingly cut off from refinancing channels. Those credit risks started to materialize in larger volumes and gradually extended to more asset classes as well. As Credit and Credibility argues, this process of paring back government guarantees and introducing new credit risks remains the most probable path to a systemic crisis in China’s financial system. When investors cannot know how Beijing’s intentions to provide guarantees are changing, contagion can spread as guarantees are questioned in more and more asset classes. Rather than investors relying upon protection from Beijing’s guarantees, the new uncertainty concerning more and more assets that can default has created the potential for additional financial contagion and systemic risks. It is difficult for any investor to know at what point Beijing will be comfortable with the rise in credit risk versus uncomfortable about the potential financial contagion that could result from widespread risk aversion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, the deleveraging campaign reinflated China’s largest financial bubble — the residential housing market. In addition, deleveraging shifted the risks of the bubble bursting into direct costs from homeowners facing the prospect of houses that might not be delivered instead of developers owing money to unstable financial institutions. When developers repaid shadow banks calling in their credit lines, they did so with money from home buyers who had taken out mortgage loans. The entire property sector became far more reliant upon preconstruction sales as a source of financing, which was arguably riskier than developers borrowing from shadow lenders. Rather than be hit by deleveraging, developers expanded their overall borrowing and reinflated property starts to new highs as an alternative source of financing. As a result, the deleveraging campaign arguably contributed to systemic risks from a property market collapse while attempting to address shadow banking challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reducing Economic Pressures from Rising Local Government Debt:&lt;/strong&gt; Very little progress was made in reducing the debt of local governments or the corresponding constraints on future growth, despite Beijing’s efforts to reduce implicit debt and to crack down on shadow financing channels. Generally speaking, local government debt continued rising throughout the deleveraging campaign, including the short-term interest burden from LGFVs. Estimated total debt from LGFVs rose from 24.1 trillion yuan ($3.5 trillion) in 2016 to 56.7 trillion yuan ($8.3 trillion) in 2021, with a steady rise each year (Figure 6.2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/zrNvjo3.png&quot; alt=&quot;image32&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though local governments were cut off from shadow financing channels, they had opportunities to borrow directly from the formal banking system and were able to crowd out other borrowers, including private sector firms. Through this process, the overall efficiency of China’s financial system in generating economic growth declined, with more new credit being channeled to repay existing debt rather than fund more productive activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even now, one of the most pressing potential risks to China’s financial system is the possibility that LGFV bonds might start defaulting in large numbers, indicating the continued salience of local government debt risks. The deleveraging campaign made very little progress in minimizing or eliminating these risks, with declining infrastructure investment since 2017 indicating the structural challenges posed by rising debt servicing costs for LGFVs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reducing Debt Levels of SOEs to Improve Efficiency:&lt;/strong&gt; SOEs did not meaningfully reduce their debt levels throughout the deleveraging campaign, despite targets to do so. These targets were delivered in September 2018 when the Party Central Committee and the State Council required all SOEs to cut leverage by 2 percentage points from 2017 levels by the end of 2020. Generally, few firms actually reduced overall debt levels, as they were able to maintain access to credit from the banking system, and private sector firms suffered disproportionately. In addition, one of the primary tools Beijing had anticipated for reducing SOE leverage, debt-to-equity swaps, never accelerated during the deleveraging campaign, as banks were unwilling to take the additional risks attached to equity holdings in state-owned companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the signs of the continued pressure from SOE debt burdens was the surge in issuance of SOEs’ perpetual bonds in late 2018 and early 2019. Perpetual bonds are classified as equity rather than debt and would therefore allow SOEs to meet some of their requirements for reducing formal debt levels. Usually, these bonds are three or five years in duration, with a call option for the issuer to extend the bond’s duration, making them “perpetual.” Issuance of these bonds surged at the end of 2018, as SOEs were scrambling to meet their targets. But in reality, the perpetual bonds were simply higher-interest debt that technically increased SOEs’ overall debt servicing costs and the risks associated with rising debt levels. This was not a meaningful reduction in systemic risks associated with SOE debt levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-the-deleveraging-campaign-reveals-about-chinas-economy&quot;&gt;What the Deleveraging Campaign Reveals about China’s Economy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deleveraging campaign made significant inroads against certain types of systemic financial risks in China — those associated with funding stress on the liabilities side of banks’ balance sheets and the potential linkages between banks and riskier nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs). By the end of 2018, the risk of a June 2013–style liquidity crisis in which banks struggled to meet liquidity demand from WMP redemptions was substantially lower than at the start of the deleveraging campaign in May 2016. Similarly, the overall size of the informal financial sector shrank in 2017 and 2018, and risks from bad loans within that sector correspondingly declined. When P2P networks started imploding, they were not intertwined enough within China’s financial system to have a meaningful impact on China’s banks or major borrowers. In those aspects, the deleveraging campaign made China’s broader financial system safer and more stable, even if overall economic growth slowed and new credit risks emerged in individual sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flip side of this suppression of risks on the liabilities or funding side of banks’ balance sheets was the creation of new risks on the asset or lending side. Simply put, by shrinking credit available to corporate borrowers who had depended upon cheap credit and soft budget constraints for years, many firms were now cut off from financing and had to make difficult decisions about hiring, new investment, and repaying their debt. Throughout this process, state-owned firms and local governments managed to maintain access to the formal banking system, while private firms were disproportionately affected by the slowdown in credit growth. Low-income households were suddenly deprived of credit as well, as lending to these riskier borrowers without credit histories naturally required lenders willing to take additional risk and seeking higher yields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shadow banking, while generating new risks, had also been the primary channel for financial deepening — the expansion of financial services to new borrowers — within China’s staid and conservative banking system, which had always prioritized stability over efficiency or innovation. The potential for shadow banks to bypass the state-owned banking oligopolies and allow small businesses, sole proprietorships, and low-income households to obtain credit for the first time was one of the primary reasons China’s reformers and financial technocrats wanted to see these channels expand and at first took a more permissive attitude toward prudential regulation. The lending was risky in aggregate, but any expansion of finance to new borrowers was likely to entail new risks. In the course of attacking shadow banks, the deleveraging campaign also reversed meaningful steps in China’s financial deepening and left smaller private borrowers and low-income households scrambling for alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replacing funding risks with credit risks was a fairly predictable consequence of the deleveraging campaign, which could have been reasonably expected as credit slowed. Property developers’ redirection of shadow credit into borrowing from home buyers was almost completely unexpected. The property industry relied heavily upon credit and borrowing from shadow banks in particular. So when shadow banks contracted meaningfully in 2017 and 2018, it was highly surprising that plans for new housing construction actually started accelerating (Figure 6.3). Developers could borrow from homeowners, taking out mortgages to repay loans to shadow banks. As a result, the housing bubble reinflated and required blunter measures such as the “three red lines” restricting developers’ overall borrowing to contain the growth in the sector. The deleveraging campaign created both predictable and unanticipated consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/80B2c8D.png&quot; alt=&quot;image33&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the deleveraging campaign broke the assumption of explicit and implicit guarantees throughout China’s financial system. Through signaling from China’s political leadership, the crackdown on shadow banks created new political signals that Chinese authorities were comfortable with a certain degree of financial instability. Even protests surrounding the implosions of P2P networks in the heart of Beijing in August 2018 did not move authorities to intervene and support these institutions, as had been common in the past. Defaults became increasingly probable in multiple asset classes, moving closer to core areas of government support, including local government state-owned firms and trust companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet while moral hazard across China’s broader financial system was broken, the problem of implicit government guarantees within some asset markets was not. Central state-owned firms and LGFVs were still assumed to be guaranteed because none of these firms had yet defaulted. So as overall credit growth declined, financial resources redirected to the only “safe” areas of the economy, even though these were the least efficient firms in terms of their ability to generate economic returns from new investment. Deleveraging did little to correct the problems of the outsized role of SOEs within China’s economy and, ironically, strengthened their importance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, the notable successes of the deleveraging campaign did not necessarily improve the sustainability of China’s economic growth for the next decade. Credit growth at high rates was intrinsic to the rapid economic growth in China following the global financial crisis. With the property sector now meaningfully contracting and returns on local government infrastructure investment naturally declining, Beijing is left to look for other drivers of growth, with few easy options given the costs of managing the legacy debt from past investments. As overall credit growth slows, investment will slow as well. Construction of residential or commercial property or infrastructure is unlikely to be a structural driver of economic growth in the future. Even as household savings rates fall as China’s population ages, consumption-led growth will be slower than investment-led growth, mostly because consumption is constrained by incomes, and household incomes in China remain at low levels, around 60 percent of GDP. Disposable incomes after taxes and social insurance contributions are generally lower, below 50 percent of GDP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The structural slowdown in credit growth will induce an endogenous slowdown in new investment and GDP growth as well. Beijing has no realistic option to accelerate credit growth to the roughly 15 percent pace seen in the 2010s, given the existing size of the financial system and the sudden emergence of credit risk driving multiple lenders to be cautious in lending. The deleveraging campaign that started in 2016 marked the peak of China’s credit-driven economic growth model. As credit growth slowed, prospects for China’s future economic expansion correspondingly declined. The deleveraging campaign was highly necessary to eliminate near-term financial risk but insufficient to lay the foundation for more stable and sustainable growth in China’s economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deleveraging campaign’s results highlight the limited degree of control that policymakers have over economic outcomes, even within an authoritarian state-controlled financial system such as China’s. Controlling credit growth was dangerous, even if failing to act and allowing systemic risks to build in 2017 and 2018 would have been far worse and may have created a different type of financial crisis. Reining in financial risks and volatility in financial markets by reimposing controls and regulatory restrictions on certain types of borrowing and lending limits dynamism in the economy and creates volatility elsewhere within the financial system. Following the global financial crisis, China’s policymakers had been willing to countenance more financial risks and volatility as a counterweight to political risks and potential instability. The deleveraging campaign was designed to curtail financial risks, which ended up creating new economic and political risks, particularly from property developers’ unfinished houses. Policymakers cannot control market outcomes in China’s financial system, and there remains no magic solution to deflate an unprecedented credit bubble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;deleveraging-and-chinas-political-transition&quot;&gt;Deleveraging and China’s Political Transition&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deleveraging arguably came far too late in China. Had the PBOC stood its ground in the aftermath of the June 2013 interbank market crisis and moved forward with an aggressive monetary and regulatory tightening agenda after delivering a shot across the bow of the banking system, the costs of adjustment would have been far lower. But there was clearly no political constituency in China that could have sustained a prolonged deleveraging campaign in 2013, nor a political structure that could have approved such a campaign. In the first year of Chinese president Xi Jinping’s administration, China’s economic decisionmaking was still driven primarily via multiple inputs into the State Council and the Economic and Financial Leading Small Group. Decisionmaking involved compromises, even if there was no complete consensus among policymakers, but multiple inputs into the policymaking process were likely to be heard. Local governments and SOEs would be able to push back against the PBOC’s calls for more aggressive regulation, particularly monetary tightening. After all, in 2013, shadow banks were just starting to ramp up their activities, and the risks were not apparent to most outside of the financial system. Following the global financial crisis, Beijing had been comfortable with trade-offs favoring stronger economic growth, even if financial risks were rising as a result. Regulatory oversight of the shadow banking system was still conflicted among several different institutions as well. It would take time to build the internal political case for a more aggressive deleveraging campaign in China, and those conditions were not present in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deleveraging campaign arrived in the later years of Xi’s first term, when consensus-driven policymaking was still the norm in China. Chapter 2 described the formation of the political consensus behind deleveraging, as the multiple bubbles and extensive speculation in China’s financial markets exposed the systemic risks that were building. This allowed financial technocrats to overcome objections from local governments, as shadow banks had weak bases of political support. The increasing centralization of authority under Xi and the regulatory restructuring creating the Financial Stability and Development Committee helped to reinforce the political importance of deleveraging and created conditions for sustaining the campaign despite its impact on the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The centralization of power in China under Xi and his direct support for certain policy initiatives made it far more difficult for those policies to be reversed, unless Xi himself reversed them publicly. As a result, when Xi publicly identified with the phrase “houses are for living, not for speculation,” it was a reasonable conclusion that any support Beijing would provide for the property sector would be limited, since Xi wanted to see lower levels of speculation. Similarly, crackdowns against education technology firms and internet platform companies in 2021 were seen as part of a broader political campaign to promote “common prosperity” in China. Despite the impact of these regulatory efforts on economic growth, Beijing pushed through, raising new questions about what Xi’s priorities actually were and where maintaining economic growth or financial stability might fit within a new set of politically determined objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under collective leadership, government guarantees of financial assets had more force and credibility behind them because there would be multiple voices in favor of stability and these voices would be heard in the policymaking process at some level. In contrast, under centralized leadership, government guarantees were now vulnerable if perceptions of Xi’s preferences changed, while other voices were far less prominent in decisionmaking. This process of political centralization accelerated the unwinding of China’s credit and property bubbles by exposing more assets to new default risks and increasing risk aversion among lenders. It is impossible to assess the legacy of the deleveraging campaign without considering how the increasing centralization of political power influenced its effectiveness and amplified the effect of both monetary and regulatory tightening steps. Regulatory actions initiated in 2013 would not have had the same force and impact on market perceptions of risk within China’s financial system as those in 2021 and 2022, and the centralization of power in China was a critical factor behind that change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, China’s deleveraging campaign exposed the inefficiency of China’s unreformed economic growth model by stripping away the credit growth that had maintained rapid rates of economic expansion, despite the inefficiencies of the state’s role within the economy. The PBOC initiated both monetary and regulatory changes, but the effectiveness of these steps was limited by the state’s role within the economy and the financial system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than reduce borrowing costs for the “real economy,” cracking down on informal financial channels raised costs and squeezed finances for the private sector, while banks maintained lending to inefficient state-owned borrowers and local governments. Their implicit guarantees remained intact, despite the deleveraging campaign, because of state-owned firms and localities’ heft within China’s political structure, not because of their economic efficiency or performance. This is not a critique of the deleveraging campaign itself, but its impact within China’s political system was always going to be tempered by the nature of the Chinese state and the impact of state participation within the financial system. Deleveraging ended China’s unprecedented credit bubble, which revealed the limits of relying upon a state-directed and investment-led growth model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinas-upcoming-policy-choices-and-implications-for-the-united-states&quot;&gt;China’s Upcoming Policy Choices and Implications for the United States&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deleveraging campaign launched in 2016 marked one of the most significant efforts Beijing has made to counter systemic risks within its financial system and implicitly shift its economic growth model. But in the campaign’s aftermath, following the contraction of the shadow banking sector, China now faces an unprecedented series of economic challenges and few options to maintain a pace of economic growth in line with the leadership’s objectives to double per capita GDP between 2020 and 2035. Neither the property sector nor local government infrastructure investment can serve as a driver of economic expansion. Credit growth overall will slow from current levels as the financial system expands at a slower rate than the real economy, reversing the trend seen over the past two decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing is also losing control over its ability to influence the economy with fiscal policy, given the rising levels of local government debt and the pressure of debt service on future spending capacity. Local government financing vehicles (LGFVs) are already defaulting on some forms of borrowing and are increasingly at risk of defaulting on bonds. An inability to maintain financing access to these vehicles would effectively limit Beijing’s ability to use fiscal policy to drive additional investment and maintain growth. Some form of bailout of China’s localities will be necessary in the years ahead, most likely using fiscal resources or an expansion of funding from the central bank’s balance sheet. A recent article in the journal Qiushi (“Seeking Truth”) seemed to flag the necessity of such a restructuring of local government debt, with the need to extend maturities of local government debt and reduce interest rates. After such a bailout, additional long-term sources of revenue for China’s local governments, most likely including new taxes, will be necessary. Both credit-fueled investment from state-owned companies and local government infrastructure investment cannot be the answer to Beijing’s search for new drivers of economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, China’s demographic realities are now tempering Beijing’s economic ambitions. Before the release of 2020 census data in May 2021, most independent estimates of China’s population trajectory placed the country’s population peak in the late 2020s or early 2030s. But birth rates have collapsed in recent years, amplified by the pandemic. Total births in China reached only 9.6 million in 2022, down from 17.9 million in 2016 and 10.6 million in 2021. As a result, China’s overall population declined in 2022, nine years after the working-age population peaked and began declining in 2013. These demographic headwinds are new obstacles to continued growth that Beijing could not have anticipated when formulating its long-term economic plans just a few years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some challenges are far more pressing, including managing the financial fallout from the property sector’s decline and rising credit risks as defaults and insolvencies continue to grow. The property sector benefited disproportionately from China’s record-breaking credit expansion, so the losses from both mortgage loans and loans to developers will impact the financial institutions that extended them. So far, mortgage loans appear to be safer, but the extent of the decline in overall property prices remains unclear and could accelerate. Smaller banks are rapidly reorganizing and consolidating to improve their overall balance sheets to meet regulatory limits. Credit risks from corporate bonds and commercial acceptances (short-term financing issued by companies themselves) are rising as the economy slows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2019, before the Covid-19 pandemic, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) conducted stress tests in which “severely adverse” scenarios for GDP growth were placed at 4.15 percent. Since then, the economy has seen two years of official growth below those levels — in 2020 and 2022. There are reasonable arguments that 2022 economic growth was negative given the adverse impacts of lockdowns and Covid-19 restrictions on both investment and household consumption. Average growth rates during the three years of the pandemic were only 4.5 percent, even based on official data. Before the slowdown during the pandemic, Beijing did not consider the economic growth rates China has seen over the past three years as within the reasonable range of probabilities. Now, it remains unclear how China can maintain growth close to these levels over the next decade without relying upon the property sector, infrastructure investment, or rapid credit expansion. The deleveraging campaign marked the sunset of China’s previous economic growth model, giving Beijing some stark options to adjust its strategic approach from here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;state-and-market-forces-in-chinas-financial-system&quot;&gt;State and Market Forces in China’s Financial System&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deleveraging campaign also highlights the difficulties of reform within a hybrid economic and financial system where the state retains a significant role among both borrowers and lenders, which can distort market signals to private enterprises. One of the effects of the campaign was that private firms’ sources of financing were squeezed while the risk of default among private enterprises rose, in contrast to state firms, which were still perceived to be guaranteed. As a result, the deleveraging campaign reversed some of the progress of reforms designed to expand private sector access to financing overall and improve the broader efficiency of the financial system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the property market adjustment continues, the same dynamic is repeating itself. Heavily leveraged private developers are now struggling to borrow, given the broader risk aversion from lenders to the sector. Banks are being instructed to increase credit to the property sector overall, but lenders only feel comfortable extending loans to state-owned firms. As sales revenues continue declining, state-owned developers will likely be able to acquire the assets of more distressed private developers, increasing the presence of state firms within the sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interest rate adjustments can similarly have unintended effects in half-reformed financial systems. State firms and state banks almost always distort signals that should emerge from market-based pricing of capital. China’s deposit and lending rates were previously administratively set in order to guarantee some profits for state-owned banks while keeping borrowing costs for state-owned companies low, in order to generate incentives for investment. By 2015, lending rates were fully liberalized, and the PBOC abolished the formal ceiling of deposit rates relative to a benchmark rate. In theory, this meant that banks could offer higher deposit rates to attract funding, but in practice, banks continued to use informal coordination among themselves to keep these deposit rates low and prevent banks from competing based on interest rates. The benchmark deposit rate remains in place today as the unreformed portion of China’s interest rate system. As a result, banks remain in an uncertain position in managing their own financial conditions, with funding rates still largely set via administrative fiat while lending rates respond more meaningfully to market forces. These distortions have prevented Beijing from stimulating credit growth when the economy slows, as banks remain unable to push down borrowing rates by sufficient margins to generate credit demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the goals of the deleveraging campaign was to reduce the influence of the shadow banking system, which lends at high interest rates, in order to allow borrowers in the “real economy” to access credit at lower borrowing rates that are more sustainable. But even after shadow banks retreated, formal banks were reluctant to lend at lower rates and resisted multiple attempts to pass on lower funding costs to final borrowers. In the opposite direction, pushing interest rates higher to reduce credit demand and control overall financial system growth can, ironically, increase financial risks if state-owned borrowers are insensitive to rising interest costs and then push up interest rates for private borrowers by larger margins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this stage, even if structural reform efforts move forward with greater speed, it seems extremely unlikely that state ownership of the banking system will change, that state-owned enterprizes (SOEs) will become a much smaller force within China’s economy, or that SOEs will quickly lose access to credit from state banks. The result is that the rest of the world will need to confront engagement with a Chinese financial system that continues to see meaningful state-led distortions in the pricing of capital and the allocation of credit. Conventional wisdom suggests that liberalizing China’s financial markets and permitting more foreign participation would be beneficial in breaking down some of these constraints and improving efficiency in China’s allocation of capital. But if those market mechanisms simply will not operate for significant proportions of borrowers and lenders within China’s economy, and those borrowers and lenders become more important forces within the economy over time, then the benefits of liberalization and foreign participation in markets will be similarly limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;centralization-of-political-power-and-credibility-of-chinas-policymaking&quot;&gt;Centralization of Political Power and Credibility of China’s Policymaking&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of the deleveraging campaign, starting in 2016, reveals changes in the adaptability of China’s policymaking over time as well. The campaign designed to remake China’s economic growth model started with an aggressive leadership messaging effort to build consensus across China’s bureaucracy. Then technocrats in the financial bureaucracies, primarily at the PBOC, started the aggressive monetary and regulatory tightening efforts necessary to control shadow banking and bring down overall credit growth. But those technocrats struggled to maintain the political consensus behind deleveraging, given widespread pushback from SOEs, local governments, and other Chinese officials more interested in maintaining economic growth than controlling credit and financial risks. Even though the campaign was led from the top, there was always a consensus-oriented element necessary to maintain political momentum in controlling credit growth and shadow banking activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another campaign, launched just five years later, in 2021, appeared very different in scope and mechanics, though the objective was the same: restructuring China’s current pattern of economic growth and reorienting goals around “common prosperity.” The new campaign was designed to limit the influence of technology giants and internet platform companies on the economy, including the effort to reverse Didi’s initial public offering in the United States and similar regulatory efforts targeting Alibaba, Meituan, Tencent, and other firms. Those actions were followed by a surprise regulatory change to suddenly outlaw the profitability, capital raising, and equity listings of education firms in July 2021, presumably as an effort to reduce the rising cost of raising and educating children as China’s birth rate declined. These regulatory changes, announced quickly and without warning, shocked financial markets and forced financial technocrats to defend the government’s actions to foreign investors in an effort to manage the fallout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most important trends occurring between these two campaigns was the rising centralization of authority in China under Xi Jinping. In early 2018, the CCP set events in motion that effectively ended term limits for the position of general secretary, allowing Xi to remain in his position for a third term starting in 2022, longer than the norm of two terms established under Deng Xiaoping’s bureaucratic reforms in the 1980s. That shift had a meaningful impact on Chinese policymaking as well, as decisionmaking authority started to move away from more conventional technocratic organizations under the State Council toward CCP-led organizations where Xi exercised a more direct role. Policymaking conducted by political campaign is far less predictable and operates contrary to the requirements of a market-driven economy, where rules and incentives of regulatory institutions are more transparent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end of China’s “zero-Covid” policy was another powerful example of this trend of centralization of authority. Despite the rising costs of the draconian controls on people’s movement and onerous testing requirements, the identification of Covid-19 policy with Xi personally meant that local officials continued to compete with one another to strictly enforce testing requirements and restrictions, even after it became highly impractical to do so given the contagion of the virus. When Xi finally shifted his rhetoric concerning the policy in late November 2022, partially in response to nationwide protests, local governments quickly competed to shift in the opposite direction and dismantle the controls, even before there was a plan to phase out restrictions and improve access to vaccinations, which could have limited the public health impacts of a debilitating wave of the virus. Instead, the disease spread at rapid rates nationwide in December 2022 and January 2023. The centralization of authority in China meant that no one within the political system could entertain an open policy debate concerning the zero-Covid policy until Xi himself wanted to see it dismantled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the critical questions now facing China’s economy concerns how new structural reforms or changes in China’s strategic priorities can be credibly communicated. While the deleveraging campaign showed how pressure for reform could advance from below and how maintaining a political consensus was difficult but necessary, reformist signals from lower-level officials will not have the same clout in a centralized political system. Unless Xi himself announces a clear intention to make a particular strategic choice, it is difficult for experiments in reform, which had been so central to China’s four decades of “reform and opening,” from gaining momentum and being used as trials for potential nationwide expansion. Changing China’s growth model cannot occur simply based on top-down announcements, as millions of market participants need to believe that the system is changing to be willing to take risks in the economy and in financial markets. After all, a speech from Xi reversing the previous party line on a particular sector could quickly reduce the value of new investments. This is a particularly concerning trend given the rising scrutiny of the financial sector by China’s anticorruption investigators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s centralized political system is less capable of sustaining meaningful economic reforms than in the past, in part because it is difficult for officials to communicate their intentions to reform the system credibly. The deleveraging campaign operated in a far different political context as a sustained effort to reform China’s financial system and generated some meaningful successes along with some unintended consequences. Now a new generation of leadership must make more difficult strategic choices concerning the future direction of the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-new-economic-leadership-confronts-complex-strategic-economic-choices&quot;&gt;A New Economic Leadership Confronts Complex Strategic Economic Choices&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the 20th Party Congress and Xi’s reappointment to a third term as the CCP’s general secretary, China appointed new economic leadership, led by a new premier, Li Qiang, and Xi’s confidant He Lifeng as vice-premier in charge of finance and economics. He replaced Liu He, the presumed driving force behind China’s deleveraging campaign and an official with strongly reform-oriented views. However, the leadership of China’s central bank and finance ministry remained in place, suggesting a need for policy continuity and steady hands as difficult choices loom for the economy and financial system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new set of leading officials confronts complex trade-offs regarding management of the rising risks within the financial system and the structural slowdown of China’s economy. Tactically, several steps can be taken to repair some of the damage from China’s zero-Covid policies. But strategically these choices involve deciding which portions of China’s economy the leadership sees as essential for China’s interests in the future and which are more marginal. All of these choices raise the question of where China will try to direct the economy after the deleveraging campaign shrank the timeline of the previous growth model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the deleveraging campaign, Beijing essentially has four options in attempting to keep its economy operating and its financial system stable. Each involves different trade-offs between economic growth and stability. None of these options assumes that Beijing will launch significant structural reforms of its economy through steps such as breaking up SOE oligopolies or aggressively liberalizing financial markets to crowd in private capital into underserved sectors. These steps could unlock significant gains in productivity and help improve China’s growth potential in the long term after incurring some short-term costs. But they have been promised since 2013, in the early stages of Xi’s administration, with little evidence of progress over the past decade. Reforms have frequently been initiated, only to be quickly reversed after dramatic economic consequences become apparent, in a pattern similar to the interbank market crisis of 2013. This suggests structural reforms have already been attempted, raising obstacles to additional attempts; the assumption of reform cannot be the base case in any set of expectations about China’s future. But without more aggressive structural reforms to unlock growth potential, the option set that Beijing confronts in managing its financial system is far more limited in scope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DOUBLING DOWN ON DELEVERAGING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategic option for Beijing most in line with reform-oriented objectives would be to double down on controlling risks in the financial system. Leaders would conclude that the costs of deleveraging are manageable and that financial risks in the economy are still brewing, requiring relatively strict limits on credit and debt growth to ensure the sustainability of China’s economic expansion in the future. Essentially, this option sees Beijing accepting slower economic growth as inevitable, either because of China’s demographic challenges or because of the weakening property sector. Hence, leaders would decide it is imperative to control rising financial risks now rather than add to them and make the problem even more difficult to manage later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doubling down would involve new restrictions on local government borrowing and SOEs, given that these sectors have effectively circumvented the effects of the deleveraging campaign since 2016. It would also involve new regulations targeting shadow banking activity and continued limits on property sector investment and borrowing by developers. Most notably, the clearest sign of Beijing embarking upon this more reform-oriented choice would be explicitly lower GDP growth targets or abandoning the targets altogether. Given the historical importance of GDP growth targets within China’s system, such a decision would highlight a significant shift in Beijing’s priorities. Based on the government work report unveiled in March 2023, there are some signs that Beijing is attempting to control continued growth in property investment and local government debt. But there are no signs Beijing is abandoning its economic growth targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The likely consequences of this set of policies would be a significant slowdown in economic growth. This would reduce the international tension associated with democratic and autocratic systems, as China’s model would likely face its own limits, just as the Soviet economy did in the 1980s. The fact that China’s loss of international influence would be a meaningful consequence makes this strategic option highly unpalatable from Beijing’s perspective. However, China would likely garner some support from financial markets and international policymakers as well, as financial technocrats would appear to be driving economic policymaking once again and responding effectively to China’s long-term challenges by creating the conditions for a more sustainable economy in the future. However, most of the media response to Beijing doubling down on deleveraging would likely be focused on the slowdown in growth, the inevitable costs of the property bubble bursting, and ongoing financial stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAVING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing may be comfortable with slower economic growth in the future but would need to respond more forcefully to the financial risks building at local governments. Right now, these risks are threatening to snowball and produce a fiscal crisis and pressure on the banking system. If Beijing does not respond quickly by reinforcing guarantees for these local governments and related companies, the central government could lose control over fiscal levers to support the economy. Hence, one strategic choice China’s leaders could make would be to explicitly bail out localities and their financing vehicles while maintaining pressure on shadow banks and the property sector. This would combine some elements of the strategy to double down on deleveraging while setting aside certain reform objectives. The rising risks associated with local government finances, including declining land sales revenues and the costs of zero-Covid measures, have increased the urgency of Beijing’s decisionmaking regarding local government debt pressures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary policies associated with this approach would be an explicit recognition of local government debt and a bailout or fiscalization of local government obligations, shifting them to explicit central government debts. This may also involve some form of monetization of the debt using liquidity provided from the central bank’s balance sheet. As such, there would be a large up-front fiscal cost to such a bailout, as well as the possibility of larger costs in the future, given that the purpose of this fiscalization would be to allow localities to continue investing to maintain a baseline level of infrastructure construction and growth. Presumably, this would be paired with continued pressure on property-related lending and clear overall credit limits to prevent debt from growing out of control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This option would likely continue to produce weaker economic growth, primarily from the property sector, but infrastructure investment would stabilize, preventing a sharper downturn. Chinese policymakers would generally appear reactive to financial stress rather than proactive in preventing it, given that the problems of local government debt appear intrinsic to China’s political system. Media coverage of China’s economy would probably continue to focus on the problems in China’s property sector rather than on stabilization in infrastructure investment. China’s fiscal space to stimulate the economy would appear constrained due to the required size of the bailout of local governments. But the extent of the slowdown in China’s economy would be debatable, and local government debt would no longer represent an acute risk to the financial system because most of this debt would explicitly be the obligations of the central government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAVING THE PROPERTY SECTOR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s leaders may eventually conclude the consequences of a sustained property market downturn are too severe for the party’s base of support among China’s urban middle and upper classes, both politically and economically, and take efforts to reverse their previous crackdown on the sector. In many ways, this process is already underway. But most of what Beijing has attempted to do in supporting the sector so far is to offer new credit lines to developers to complete unfinished houses and to prevent further defaults within the industry that might add to financial stress. This falls short of broader attempts to turn the overall trajectory of the sector around so it can once again represent a driver of economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The policy options that would be involved in this choice would be relaxing controls on borrowing by property developers and providing other forms of liquidity to developers to prevent defaults on their debts. In addition, both Beijing and local governments would then provide additional incentives for property purchases, likely through lower down payment requirements, lower mortgage rates, reduced taxes on resale of properties, or even subsidies for first-home purchases. Growth targets would likely be maintained in current ranges of around 5 percent, without significant revisions to prepare the political system for slower economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with these policies supporting the property sector, there is no guarantee Beijing will be successful in turning the industry around to once again power the economy. The imbalance between the pace of construction from 2016 to 2021 and fundamental demand among owner-occupiers suggests that China’s property industry needed to contract — and is in the process of doing so. China’s home ownership rates are extremely high, and new entrants to the housing market are declining. Even lower down payment requirements and mortgage rates may not encourage additional housing purchases. And even if sales do stabilize and rebound, developers may simply use the available resources to repair their balance sheets and pay down debt rather than initiate new construction activity. Once the pace of construction declines to a more sustainable level, the sector may contribute to growth cyclically from time to time, depending upon price trends and changes in monetary policy. But structurally it appears unlikely that the property sector can drive the economy forward, even if Beijing provides considerable support for the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policymakers would also appear reactive and would likely lose some credibility because of their rapid reversal in efforts to control the property sector. To a certain extent, this reaction is already unfolding, even if there is more short-term optimism about the economy because of the change of China’s Covid-19 policies. But the overall international reaction would likely remain focused on the fundamental imbalances within China’s economy and the fact that authorities needed to continue relying upon the property sector to maintain growth rather than adjust the growth model more fundamentally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OUT OF OPTIONS: BACK TO 2009&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing may also quietly conclude it cannot maintain its deleveraging objectives and its desired rates of economic growth at the same time. Hence, the financial system would need to take on its traditional role as the shock absorber for the real economy and political system, even if that means more financial risks in the future. It appears highly unlikely Beijing would ever formally announce it has reached such a conclusion, given that China’s postcrisis credit expansion was unprecedented in global and historical terms and would be viewed as extremely risky to continue. But this strategic choice would reflect an internal judgment that without strong economic growth, the political consequences for China’s leadership would simply be too severe given the importance of maintaining the internal and external perception of China’s inexorable rise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reversal of Beijing’s deleveraging objectives would essentially involve abandoning credit limits and quotas altogether. It would also involve new assistance to local governments, property developers, and home buyers to maintain the previous drivers of the economy. Economic growth targets would be raised back to the 6–7 percent range to encourage local governments to compete against one another to drive additional investment. Capital adequacy ratios for banks may need to be relaxed in order to facilitate additional credit growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The response to the abandonment of deleveraging as a strategy would likely be similar to what occurred in March 2020 immediately after the pandemic first hit China. Most companies and local governments would instantly respond to the call to drive growth again, and banks would lend aggressively and roll over loans from state-owned firms and local governments. However, the effect would be very short lived. International media coverage would focus on Beijing’s dramatic about-face and the continued headwinds to China’s economic performance in the long term, particularly given the diminishing returns of credit and investment-led growth. The financial system would likely come under severe stress only a year or two after Beijing makes this choice, given the high levels of nonperforming assets already within the banks and NBFIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BEIJING’S BEST OPTIONS FROM HERE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China faces no easy choices, and all of these options entail some costs. The slowdown in China’s economy is structural in nature, and future growth rates will not resemble those in the past. But there are certain choices that He Lifeng and his new leadership team can take that will at least prepare a foundation for more stable economic growth in the future while minimizing disruptions within the financial system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, credit growth must remain only marginally higher than nominal GDP growth but far below previous rates of credit expansion. Slowing credit growth sharply will have an immediate impact on China’s investment activity and overall economic growth. Enough credit must be provided to prevent widespread financial stress, which could endanger household consumption. But continuing to expand credit in line with previous patterns would only add to debt servicing costs that would weaken investment in the future. China’s financial system has already grown at rates much faster than the real economy over the past two decades, and slowing credit growth is a minimal requirement to reverse those trends in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, local government debt will need to be restructured and, likely, fiscalized. This probably involves guaranteeing the debts of existing LGFVs and replacing them with central government bonds but then either phasing out these companies or reorganizing their funding under central government control. The financing strains upon LGFVs at present could trigger a broader credit crunch and slowdown in the economy if firms are forced to stand on their own without guarantees. Beijing would prefer not to support LGFVs but likely has no choice. Critical decisions will be made after the reorganization and recognition of around 54 trillion yuan ($7.9 trillion), or 45 percent of GDP in local government debt, in order to prevent the problem from growing once again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, measures must be taken to use fiscal resources to improve the foundations for household consumption and reduce the household savings rate. This can involve direct fiscal transfers to households from the state, improvements in the social safety network and medical facilities to reduce precautionary savings, reducing taxes or required contribution payments, or other measures to boost the household income share of GDP after transfers. This is a broader structural reform issue rather than specifically related to the deleveraging campaign, but continuing to control credit and investment growth will essentially force household consumption to lead China’s economy forward over the next decade. Providing additional fiscal support to reduce the household savings rate is necessary to prevent a sharp slowdown in overall economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, onshore financial markets must be liberalized further to drive inflows into China’s equity and fixed-income markets. This is necessary to produce a counterbalancing inflow into renminbi-denominated assets to offset the inevitable outflows that will result from the diversification of China’s household and corporate savings into foreign assets. It also makes it easier for China’s central bank to defend the exchange rate during periods in which larger volumes of capital outflows push the currency weaker. Maintaining a stable exchange rate is necessary to incentivize additional inbound investment as well as drive additional consumption-led growth by maintaining China’s overseas purchasing power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of these choices on their own or collectively will eliminate threats to China’s financial stability, but together they should place the economy and financial system on a firmer foundation than the present continuously building credit risks. Overall, however, these options are not politically easy for Beijing to execute, particularly involving steps to boost household incomes and consumption, as well as reorganize local government debt. They involve significant admissions that past economic choices have led China toward an unsustainable path and that significant corrections that will slow economic growth are necessary. None of that messaging is consistent with the CCP’s broader propaganda messages that China’s economic rise is inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;probable-long-term-outcomes-for-chinas-economy-and-policy&quot;&gt;Probable Long-Term Outcomes for China’s Economy and Policy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if Beijing makes reasonable decisions to manage financial risks from here, the aftermath of the deleveraging campaign and the end of China’s credit-driven growth model leaves Beijing with a far more limited option set over the next decade. Predicting economic trends remains a perilous exercise, but in the absence of a significant break from China’s current trajectory of slowing credit and investment growth, some outcomes appear more probable than others. Reform trajectories unlocking faster productivity growth rates are still possible but are less probable given the attempted reforms China has already launched and reversed over the past decade. This section discusses the longer-term economic and policy implications from the deleveraging campaign’s effects itself and not necessarily the impacts of slower economic growth. Of course, weaker credit and investment growth will slow the economy as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The slowdown in credit and investment growth will continue.&lt;/strong&gt; China’s deleveraging campaign has created conditions within the financial system that will be very difficult for policymakers to reverse, even if they intend to do so. Specifically, credit growth cannot achieve the same pace as seen in the previous decade and is far more likely to slow to a single-digit pace in the future. China’s financial system is already so large, at 376.7 trillion yuan ($55.3 trillion), in bank assets, that continued expansion at double-digit rates strains both the capacity of the system under current capital requirements and demand from potential borrowers. Credit demand has weakened along with the economy in recent years, particularly from households and the private sector. Risk aversion among lenders exposed to additional credit risks will limit the types of borrowers considered creditworthy. Low rates of return on assets within the banking system will prevent the system from recapitalizing itself out of retained earnings, which will ultimately limit credit and investment growth. In the absence of meaningful structural reforms that could unlock new private sector credit demand, the overall pace of investment growth and GDP growth will slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demand for imported commodities will be weaker.&lt;/strong&gt; In several commodities markets, demand from China’s construction activity has been a critical driver of growth over the past two decades. As one of the most credit-intensive sectors in the economy, the property sector’s medium-term decline means that imports of iron ore, copper, aluminum, base metals, and some refined petroleum products will likely slow. In some cases, lower prices could increase China’s imports of these products because Chinese domestic production costs more. But for most commodities associated with China’s construction activity, the next decade of China’s demand will be much weaker, with the property sector likely to stabilize at around 40–50 percent of the previous decade’s levels of construction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interest rates for most forms of government and quasi-government borrowing will fall.&lt;/strong&gt; China’s local government debt problem is simply too large at this point to outgrow, given that potential growth in China over the next decade is below the rates seen following the 2007-08 global financial crisis, when China accumulated debt rapidly. As a result, the only effective tool to manage the debt burden is restructuring it at lower interest rates, which will probably involve funding from the central bank’s balance sheet. This also means that policy interest rates from the central bank and critical funding rates will need to decrease over time. In a highly indebted system, there are few options to meaningfully raise interest rates without triggering immediate financial stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China’s fiscal policy and responsibilities of central and local governments will be restructured.&lt;/strong&gt; One of the probable results of China’s deleveraging campaign will be a change in how China manages its fiscal policies, particularly the balance of responsibilities between central and local governments. Currently, local governments only receive a limited proportion of official tax revenues but have most of the responsibilities for social services spending, particularly for education and medical services. The recent decline in the property market has further pressured local government revenues by weakening land sales revenues, which declined by 24 percent, or around 1.6 trillion yuan ($235 billion), in 2022. The absence of bids in the land market drove localities to pressure LGFVs to buy land from local governments, and LGFVs were involved in 40–45 percent of land purchases in 2022, based on a bottom-up analysis of land auctions. In the long term, Beijing has been attempting to unlock new sources of revenue growth for localities, including the possibility of property taxes. But the decline in the property market makes this far less attractive given the government’s recent attempts to shore up demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deleveraging campaign has undercut significant sources of local government revenues via land sales and access to credit through LGFVs. As a result of weakening financing for LGFVs, Beijing is effectively losing control over fiscal policy as an instrument to stabilize the economy. The current model of local government finance is unsustainable, and one of the probable outcomes will be some reform measure rebalancing central and local revenues and responsibilities for social services spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On balance, China’s exchange rate should depreciate in the long term.&lt;/strong&gt; Predicting the movements of exchange rates may appear foolhardy, and any such projections remain speculative given the sheer uncertainty of global financial markets. But the case for a weaker exchange rate is based on the necessity of longer-term declines in interest rates in China, which will both encourage capital outflows from China’s world-leading money supply as well as reduce incentives for capital inflows into a low-interest-rate, low-growth economy. The potential use of the central bank’s balance sheet to stabilize financial conditions concerning local government debt will further incentivize capital outflows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The limited level of diversification of China’s domestic savings into foreign assets (around 98 percent of China’s deposits are held in renminbi rather than foreign currencies) offers fuel for many years of high levels of capital outflows. While the central bank had $3.13 trillion in foreign exchange reserves as of December 2022, this was only around 8 percent of China’s money supply, the lowest level in at least three decades and lower than levels even during the 1997 Asian financial crisis. As a result, the PBOC will likely be selective in choosing when to intervene to support the currency, particularly if the economy is slowing and exporters could benefit from some currency depreciation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trade surpluses from China and trade deficits in developed economies should continue.&lt;/strong&gt; The probable results of slower economic growth and a weaker exchange rate in China will be stronger exports from China and weaker Chinese imports from the rest of the world. Every meaningful slowdown in China’s investment growth rate has driven an expansion of the trade surplus, affecting both import prices and volumes. The anticipated long-term depreciation in the exchange rate will be driven primarily by changes in capital flows, which means trade flows and the current account will need to balance out those adjustments. Even if China becomes less significant within global supply chains and alternative centers for goods manufacturing emerge, imports may fall by larger margins than exports in response to a weaker exchange rate. China’s household consumption and domestic demand for raw materials will determine levels of imports, which will be pressured by the reduced purchasing power from a weaker exchange rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-us-relationship-with-chinas-financial-system&quot;&gt;The U.S. Relationship with China’s Financial System&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the rise in tensions between the United States and China in recent years, there is an active debate in the United States concerning what type of relationship the country should have with China’s financial system. The stakes of this debate are meaningful, but the U.S. interests involved are not entirely straightforward. Traditionally, the view animating U.S. financial engagement toward China over the past two decades has been that liberalization of China’s financial markets is clearly in U.S. interests. Liberalization increases opportunities for U.S. firms in a rapidly growing economy and introduces competition that would both deepen market forces within China’s financial system and facilitate operating conditions for foreign firms on a more level playing field than they presently enjoy in China. Eventually, state-owned banks, brokerages, insurance companies, and other financial institutions would need to respond to the growing demands of market competition, and foreign financial institutions would likely gain market share over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has made notable efforts toward financial reform over the past decade but has met with limited success, and the immediate market consequences of such reforms have caused Beijing to reverse course and re-establish statist influence and controls. U.S. financial institutions have expanded within China’s financial sector in absolute terms, but relative to expectations and, most importantly, to the size of the Chinese financial system, they have not. Bilaterally, Beijing has been willing to prioritize U.S. financial interests — such as concessions made within the Phase One Agreement — but to the exclusion of key segments (such as payments), and with limits in implementation. Prominent U.S. firms have gained access to new licenses and have expanded ownership stakes of their Chinese joint ventures in some segments of the financial industry. But absent broader structural reforms to the economy, Washington is no longer interested in deals that benefit financial firms disproportionately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key question remains whether or not China’s convergence with international norms, gradual or otherwise, is still possible. If that objective is impossible in the foreseeable future, given the revealed pattern of Chinese refusal to accept concomitant instability during financial transition, and the direction of the Chinese financial system continues moving away from market forces and toward greater levels of state control, then the premises of international engagement with China’s financial system are more suspect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This change in China’s reform direction has driven a larger discussion about the costs and benefits of Chinese companies providing equity offerings in the United States. Chinese firms had provided limited disclosures in the past, creating several high-profile cases in which misrepresentations by Chinese companies resulted in losses for U.S. investors. The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, passed in 2020, was a congressional response to these concerns. The resulting audits and inspections by the U.S. Public Accounting Oversight Board had reduced the probability of mass delistings of the 262 Chinese firms listed in the United States in September 2022. U.S. investors’ portfolio securities holdings of Chinese firms, including equity and debt holdings and listings in Hong Kong, totaled around $1.2 trillion as of the end of 2020. The valuations of those holdings declined significantly given the slowdown in China’s economy in 2021 and 2022, and the regulatory crackdown on key internet platform companies intensified those losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question now confronting the United States is what changes to U.S. policy priorities are necessary given that state distortions in China’s semi-reformed financial markets are likely to persist. Financial risks in China’s system are likely to increase in the years ahead, and exposing U.S. investors and companies to those risks must be balanced against the potential returns. At the same time, Chinese firms selling securities overseas typically have alternative financing sources within the domestic economy as well. Therefore, reducing U.S. investments in those firms generally does not impact Chinese companies but reduces potential benefits to U.S. investors from higher returns or diversification of their portfolios on a global basis. The logic of pushing for divestment from Chinese securities is primarily political in nature, which is not to downplay its attractiveness in the current climate of U.S.-China relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As detailed earlier, China’s longer-term economic interests will persistently drive the country’s leadership toward further opening China’s capital markets for foreign investment, as these inflows are necessary to counterbalance the inevitable capital outflows that China will face. Even when nationalist or protectionist sentiment appears dominant in China, the priority to encourage foreign inflows into China’s financial system continues reemerging over time. Chinese officials may attempt to maintain access to capital flows without any relaxation of state control necessary for market forces to function, but any significant measures to restrict capital outflows from China will also reduce the potential for inflows into China’s markets. Portfolio flows are not likely to remain contained by Chinese capital controls, as China can slow outflows at times but is unable to stop them completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether or not meaningful reform within China’s financial system is still possible, Beijing will be forced to speak publicly and act as if market liberalization and reform are still among China’s primary policy objectives. The ideal situation for the United States would be for reformist tendencies to strengthen in China, allowing the case for engagement within a liberalizing Chinese financial system to build political momentum and increase U.S. financial institutions and investors’ exposure to a reforming economy with stronger growth prospects. While that ideal case is highly improbable, there is still a strong argument for maintaining access for U.S. financial investments into China’s equity and fixed-income markets while also tightening and maintaining regulatory controls on the types of Chinese firms that can access capital in U.S. financial markets. The rising risks emerging from China’s financial system at present require U.S. regulators to seek additional disclosures about those risks to level the playing field across U.S. financial markets so that the information Chinese firms provide is equivalent in accuracy and reliability to that of other listed U.S. firms. Many of those steps are already in process and should continue to squeeze any loopholes in disclosure requirements that emerge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the logic for diversification of global investment portfolios into renminbi-denominated assets is strong as well, given the historically closed nature of China’s capital markets, which means that global investors hold very small proportions of renminbi-denominated assets relative to the size of China’s economy. Global investors continue to beware the risks of direct investments in China’s markets. Geopolitical risks of investments in China have been rising for several years already, and intensified after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, making Beijing’s task far more difficult. But this is Beijing’s own challenge — successfully attracting large volumes of foreign capital likely requires commitments to reform that are currently unpalatable in China and permitting cross-border capital flows that may influence domestic financial stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A significant degree of financial interdependence between the United States and China will continue, barring a full-blown shift of the present competition to a warlike footing, but the level of that interaction could vary greatly. As China runs a trade surplus with the United States, the dollars earned by Chinese exporters will be recycled into U.S. markets, either via Chinese companies, banks, or the central bank. This was the pattern of engagement through which China’s central bank accumulated large volumes of foreign exchange reserves and purchased U.S. Treasury debt in the 2000s. That pattern has now changed, with Chinese purchases and sales of U.S. securities becoming much more volatile, and private Chinese investors are now acquiring larger volumes of U.S. equities and bonds. Cutting back on U.S. investors’ portfolio inflows into China may narrow the channels of the financial relationship between the two countries but will not eliminate it. The United States is generally better off letting Beijing either succeed or fail in its courtship of foreign investment, rather than supply an easy scapegoat to explain flagging global interest in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Beijing succeeds in attracting sizable foreign inflows, financial interdependence carries its own political logic, and there will be stronger incentives for Chinese authorities to push toward greater market liberalization to prevent rapid capital outflows. At the very least, foreign investors will become more significant players within China’s equity and fixed-income markets with the potential to influence domestic policies and messaging to the markets even within a semi-reformed system. Portfolio flows offer few opportunities for Beijing to use economic interdependence to its political advantage, unlike similar concerns about direct investment and China’s position within global supply chains. The presence of foreign investors offers both a stabilizing source of inflows and a potential threat to stability within China’s financial markets should favorable conditions for investors change. With the added foreign inflows, China’s exchange rate will receive some external support, which will help to avoid ballooning Chinese trade surpluses and U.S. trade deficits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Beijing fails to attract inflows over time, then China has a larger problem on its hands, as existing foreign investors will likely continue shifting money out of Chinese markets. Domestic households and companies will try to diversify into foreign assets, while Beijing continues to tighten controls on those outflows. China’s exchange rate will likely depreciate, which will impact global economic growth and widen China’s external imbalances, forcing adjustments into deficit countries such as the United States. China will appear less influential within the global economy, as the size of its economy and its purchasing power will weaken in U.S. dollar terms. In this circumstance, there will still be large Chinese inflows into U.S. financial markets, but they will be led by private Chinese investors fleeing renminbi-denominated assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The political benefits and costs to the United States of these two scenarios are not readily comparable, but it is not in U.S. economic interests to see China’s exchange rate plummet, reducing China’s import levels. This would create a beggar-thy-neighbor effect on other Asian economies (including U.S. allies) and weaken the global economy. Portfolio investments are not direct investments and can shift when market conditions change. (As mentioned previously, fears of restrictions on those outflows will likely mitigate the volume of inflows.) It is also easy to see how U.S. government actions designed to restrict inflows into Chinese markets could be counterproductive and increase those investments from third parties by temporarily depressing prices — exactly what occurred when the U.S. prohibited investments in Chinese firms linked with the military in the waning days of the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regulating U.S. financial markets transparently, including Chinese firms’ participation within those markets, is clearly in U.S. interests. Influencing investors’ perceptions of China’s financial markets or patterns of participation within those markets is not. Beijing has its own challenges in attracting foreign inflows given its slowing economy, declining interest rates, opaque policymaking, and stagnant reforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;systemic-competition-and-chinas-growth-model&quot;&gt;Systemic Competition and China’s Growth Model&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As China’s structural economic slowdown continues, this is likely to impact global perceptions of the attractiveness of its economic and political system within the broader context of the ongoing narrative of competition between democratic and autocratic systems. How China responds to rising financial stress will have a meaningful impact on those perceptions as well. In theory, a capable technocratic elite within a one-party state, insulated from domestic political pressures, should be able to manage financial stress very well. China responded to the Asian financial crisis effectively, setting up a Central Financial Work Commission in 1998 under Premier Zhu Rongji’s leadership and orchestrating a significant regulatory overhaul and a restructuring of the entire banking system in the early 2000s. There are current reports that the Central Financial Work Commission could be restarted this year, highlighting the scale of China’s ongoing challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the political imperative of systemic competition and concerns about the global perceptions of China’s economy may prevent China’s financial authorities from taking the necessary steps to ensure systemic stability in the future. Chinese authorities have a number of policy tools in the event of a financial crisis, such as emergency liquidity facilities from the central bank, forced restructuring of distressed commercial banks or other financial institutions, and direct interventions into financial markets to prevent financial contagion. The problem China’s leaders face is that the use of these measures clearly indicates China is facing a financial crisis intrinsic to its growth model and past decisionmaking and reflecting upon the Chinese system as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, financial technocrats are constrained. They have plenty of crisis management tools but may never be able to use them. Using them would suggest a larger problem with China’s economic system and the politics that produced it. Push will never come to shove, as an all-out crisis management effort would suggest China’s economic system is not working. Beijing will attempt to keep the evidence of financial stress secret while quietly deploying tools to manage that stress. But it is difficult to calm financial markets quietly, as financial contagion will cause market participants to look for clear signals of reassurance from policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s deleveraging campaign set events in motion that have ended China’s credit- and investment-led growth model. But grasping the shadow banking system created additional financial risks in the property market and contributed to rising credit risks as implicit guarantees by the state eroded and defaults proliferated. In the future, China’s economic policymaking will be occupied by managing the consequences of the economic and financial conditions produced by the deleveraging campaign while attempting to maintain a narrative that China will still grow in economic and political power and influence. This was a much easier task in the last decade, when China still had years of credit and investment growth ahead. But given demographic pressures, a harsher external political environment, a declining property market, and a financial system that can no longer serve as a shock absorber for the political system, Beijing faces a tough road ahead in a competition of political systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（6日）踏入審訊第39天。時任民主動力召集人趙家賢供稱，在抗爭派記者會後清楚知道要立即退出初選，批會上言論「完全地失控」和「踩界」。控方庭上完整播放記者會片段，抗爭派表示他們已成為主流，重申會堅定否決財政預算案。其中岑敖暉稱立法會議員有權否決每一個法案及議案，並強調如果這樣都是涉嫌顛覆國家的話，「我非常之期待北京或者國安處、或者係林鄭，因為一個議員狂投否決票，而將我哋送入監牢，樂見其成」。這時延伸庭的岑敖暉、黃之鋒及吳敏兒均一同大笑；袁嘉蔚更邊笑邊拍手。在正庭的鄒家成和吳政亨也相視而笑。本案中有32人已還柙至今逾兩年。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;抗爭派稱已成主流-岑敖暉指若暴政當道會堅定否決財案若有真普選有磋商空間&quot;&gt;抗爭派稱已成主流 岑敖暉指若「暴政當道」會堅定否決財案、若有真普選有磋商空間&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢今繼續作供。控方庭上播放抗爭派在2020年7月15日舉行的記者會片段，他們於會上發言指抗爭派已成為主流，又強調否決議案是代議士的合法權利，重申他們會否決預算案，並將繼續提倡「議會攬炒」。播放片段時，趙家賢大部分時間微微低頭，間中會抬頭看前方投影的大螢幕或身旁法庭傳譯主任的電腦屏幕，他面前的電腦屏幕則繼續被3張白紙遮蓋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;岑敖暉首先讀出「抗爭派立法會參選人立場聲明」，表示「初選塵埃落定，抗爭派已成為主流」，並稱：「為咗不負港人期望，民主陣營當務之急，係要團結迎擊北京傀儡政府」。他指北京早已為破壞他們團結設下陷阱，一紙確認書簽署與否成為爭議，但取消資格與否從來不是取決於有否簽署文件。他表示：「我哋一眾抗爭派在此聲明，無論確認書最終會否加入與《國安法》有關內容，我哋都會義無反顧反對《國安法》」，並指會約見泛民主派的初選勝選人，磋商有關簽署的取態。在延伸庭的岑托着頭專心觀看片段，不時微笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;有記者問到抗爭派進入立法會後，是否會按照承諾否決財政預算案，岑敖暉重申：「我哋係會好堅定行使基本法賦予畀代議士嘅權力，所以答案係是嘅」。他補充：「如果香港係已經落實咗五大訴求，如果係有真普選嘅話，我相信我哋係會有磋商嘅空間，但係如果仍然今日係暴政當道、魔警橫行嘅話…我相信我哋係無論咩內容，都係會否決財政預算案嘅」。此時鄒家成及吳政亨相視而笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;岑敖暉非常期待國安處因議員狂投否決票而將佢哋送入監牢&quot;&gt;岑敖暉：非常期待國安處因議員狂投否決票，而將佢哋送入監牢&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;岑敖暉回答記者提問時亦指：「一個代議士，一個立法會議員係絕對有權利喺每一個法案、每一個議案、每一個撥款都係投否決，呢一個係喺《基本法》賦予立法會議員非常之清晰嘅權利」，他堅定地強調：「如果咁樣係涉嫌顛覆國家嘅話，我非常之期待北京或者國安處、或者係林鄭，因為一個議員狂投否決票，而將我哋送入監牢，樂見其成」。這時延伸庭的岑敖暉、黃之鋒及吳敏兒均一同大笑；袁嘉蔚更邊笑邊拍手。至於在正庭的鄒家成及吳政亨也相視而笑，林卓廷亦微笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;岑指開記者會目的冀不同路線的分歧完結&quot;&gt;岑指開記者會目的冀不同路線的分歧完結&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;岑敖暉亦解釋今次召開記者會的核心原因，因在初選當中有不同路線的分歧，是一場「路線之爭」，但今次並非只是民主派的內部選舉，更是面向國際及世界的選舉，但希望有初選結果之後，雙方的分歧可以完結。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;梁晃維繼續提倡議會攬炒路線&quot;&gt;梁晃維：繼續提倡議會攬炒路線&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在港島區初選勝出的梁晃維則表示，抗爭派會「繼續去阻止極權擴張」，並稱政權今日提倡「議會攬炒就係顛覆國家政權」，但他強調一旦進入立法會，「無論我哋係對政府嘅提案，定係財政預算案去投下反對票，呢一個都係我哋作為代議士嘅一個合法權利」。他明言抗爭派會「繼續提倡議會攬炒路線」，迫使政府向人民低頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;岑敖暉指抗爭派會與戴耀廷區諾軒趙家賢共同承擔責任&quot;&gt;岑敖暉指抗爭派會與戴耀廷、區諾軒、趙家賢共同承擔責任&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;梁又表示，選管會稱初選並非立法會選舉的一部分，「政權如果佢真係有任何實質證據，真係能夠攞出任何嘅法律條文，證明今次初選嘅參選人、籌辦人，或者投票嘅市民，係干犯任何法例嘅話，我懇請佢哋立即嚴正執法」。他亦強調作為參選人，「我哋亦都會同今次初選嘅籌辦人共同面對，眼前有機會發生嘅一切困難」。在延伸庭的黃之鋒及岑敖暉不禁竊笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;岑敖暉於會上亦表示，主辦初選的戴耀廷、區諾軒及民主動力「勞苦功高」。正觀看片段的岑及黃之鋒均微笑。岑續指理解在這階段退出的戰友，他強調今次初選不單是主辦3人的事，「係我哋所有唔同陣營參選人嘅事，更加係我哋60萬選民一齊作出嘅決定」，並表示：「起碼呢度咁多人，一定係會同戴耀廷教授、趙家賢博士以及區諾軒共同承擔嘅責任」。此時鄒家成邊聽邊點頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黃之鋒指特朗普再簽香港法案-籲北京政府懸崖勒馬&quot;&gt;黃之鋒指特朗普再簽香港法案 籲北京政府「懸崖勒馬」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其中有抗爭派提及國際對初選的關注。黃之鋒稱「美國總統特朗普再次簽署有關香港的法案」，他嚴正呼籲北京政府懸崖勒馬，因《國安法》通過是促成國際「圍堵中共」的主因。張崑陽則指，國際社會大肆報導初選，其中路透社更形容初選是「改朝換代」，而美國國務卿蓬佩奧更表態指，港澳辦及中聯辦聲言初選違《國安法》，是恫嚇香港人的表現。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，王百羽指，最大公因數是堅決否對財政預算案，如果五大訴求沒有落實的話。這時鄒家成笑着點頭。黃子悅則指本土派與抗爭派在初選中的大捷是屬於「手足」，「我哋唔係暴徒，只係勇於反抗暴政嘅義民」，指議會需要抗爭路上同行的人。衞生服務界的余慧明表示，抗爭派在功能組別中必不可少，批評傳統功能組別只顧自己界別內的選民，而在部份表決投票中「突然變身保皇黨」。她強調功能組別都要面對香港群眾，初選結果亦反映市民唾棄泛民主派，希望更多人會出選挑戰。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（6日）踏入審訊第39天。時任民主動力召集人趙家賢繼續作供，確認民主動力作為初選承辦機構，為初選進行眾籌、招募、宣傳和為參選人申報開支等。法官陳慶偉問及民主動力在2020年6月宣布眾籌的帖文內，提及「光復議會」和「對抗暴政」的意思，趙指當時民間社會覺得受到「好強大嘅政治打壓」，以「對抗暴政」表達憤慨，並在法官追問下指相信「暴政」是指當時的香港政府。被問該些字眼是否民主動力的政治立場，趙稱「絕對不是」，並說「抱歉法官閣下，我要認錯」，「我冇做好謹慎責任嘅角色」，有被告說「嘩」，多人發笑。趙在追問下指民主動力並非「政治中立」，是屬民主陣營的組織。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙確認民主動力為初選眾籌340多萬招募逾2500義工&quot;&gt;趙確認民主動力為初選眾籌340多萬、招募逾2,500義工&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢繼續作供。控方展示民主動力6月9日的Facebook帖文，以「2020年立法會選舉-民主派35+公民投票及眾籌行動」為題，提及為初選進行眾籌和招募，目標金額350萬。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢確認民主動力為了初選和該會的經費而進行眾籌，並指當時戴耀廷計算過約需300至400萬開支，並在6月9日記者會上指需400萬，而趙為了讓關注人士較容易記得「35+」的目標，故將金額調低至350萬，最終籌得340多萬元。趙又指就相關眾籌，「我哋都特別由我提出，係根據返選舉事務處嘅選舉指引嘅精神」，呼籲捐贈1,000元或以下的「小額眾籌」，他們最後亦將多於1,000元的款項排除在初選的開支經費。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就招募的人員數目，趙指各區有區議員、社區主任和義工等協助，但沒有仔細問總幹事，不能確切回答，但指共有250多個票站，各票站有站長和核心義工，另有一些義工協助排隊、維持秩序和宣傳，每個票站約有10人，大致上共有逾2,500人。法官陳仲衡問工作人員有否報酬，趙指民主動力秘書處就此項目聘請的兼職會有報酬，而各票站義工吃飯、食水、電芯等物資，會先由該票站站長先墊支，再向民主動力報銷。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙確認民主動力為參選人申報開支於蘋果日報等媒體賣廣告宣傳初選&quot;&gt;趙確認民主動力為參選人申報開支、於《蘋果日報》等媒體賣廣告宣傳初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;主控萬德豪續要求趙總結民主動力在初選的工作，趙重申民主動力因戴耀廷和區諾軒的邀請，而「承辦咗初選呢個活動項目」，「我哋係初選呢個活動嘅承辦機構」。而就此「活動項目」，民主動力向公眾進行眾籌收集資金開展活動，亦是所有初選參選人的「選舉服務提供者」，民主動力會就提供過的服務以選舉捐贈的形式給予所有參選人，為他們填寫和遞交選舉開支申報書，以附合選舉法例。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙亦確認，民主動力負責準備和收集提名表格，並在Facebook帖文發布連結供人下載。民主動力亦有參與宣傳，呼籲市民參與7月11及12日的投票，趙指作為承辦機構有責任讓公眾認知其承辦項目，確認他曾指示秘書處在傳統紙媒及網媒賣廣告，舉例《蘋果日報》手機應用程式內亦有初選的電子廣告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問民主動力帖文光復議會對抗暴政意思-趙一度指不同人有不同解讀&quot;&gt;官問民主動力帖文「光復議會」、「對抗暴政」意思 趙一度指不同人有不同解讀&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉其後主動就帖文內容發問，趙確認帖文中提及眾籌和招募義工均是民主動力的工作，指他們承辦活動時的分工，「呢啲人力資源嘅安排都係我哋去做統籌」；又確認帖文多數由總幹事草擬，他就大項目會審視並進行修訂，再作發布。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;帖文中提及「#團結一致 #立會過半 #光復議會 #對抗暴政 #711及712投票 #民主派 #35plus #公民投票」。陳慶偉問及，「#光復議會」的意思是什麼？趙望住螢幕思考數秒指，「喺我嘅理解係立法會過咗一半，民主派就能夠將議會個功能能夠光復到，就實行到民主派一啲嘅政策倡議」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續問文中有「#對抗暴政」，「你是指哪個暴政？」，趙沒有正面回答，僅指「當時嘅社會環境底下，支持民主嘅民間社會，覺得係受到好強大嘅政治打壓，而對抗暴政嘅意思都係表達緊呢種憤慨」，並指「當然係講緊現有政權」。陳追問，是現有的香港政府抑或中國政府？抑或兩者皆是？趙指「我只可以講，唔同人睇到呢個字眼會按佢自己嘅思維有不同嘅解讀」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢稱對抗暴政等絕對不是民動立場-向法官認錯指無做好謹慎責任角色&quot;&gt;趙家賢稱「對抗暴政」等絕對不是民動立場 向法官認錯指無做好謹慎責任角色&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指着電腦螢幕：「你的Facebook專頁，你告訴我」，趙再答「我相信係講緊當時嘅香港政府」。陳問，這是否也是當時民主動力的政治立場？趙答：「回應法官閣下，我作為召集人，我要講嘅係絕對不是」，陳續問若然如此，為何會有該些字眼？此時趙說：「抱歉法官閣下，我要認錯」，有被告大聲說「嘩」，鄒家成、何桂藍等多人發笑。趙續說：「我冇做好謹慎責任嘅角色，原因係職員草擬咗比我嘅時候，我着重睇嘅位置，當時冇特別留意到呢個位」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續問，那民主動力是否沒有政治立場、是政治中立，只是作為承辦人（contractor）的角色？趙指他們當然是承辦人，「但我哋當然亦都係作為傳統民主派嘅一個協調組織，同埋一個協作交流嘅平台，所以我唔可以話係政治中立，因為民主動力本身都係一個喺民主陣營裡面嘅組織」。陳續問，故因此帖文該部分是一個完全的錯誤？趙指，若當時有做好謹慎責任，在該句便不會加入「#光復議會 #對抗暴政」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，趙家賢上周稱雙眼看眼前電腦螢幕較「辛苦」，法庭終以3張白紙遮蓋他面前電腦螢幕。趙的電腦今續被白紙遮蓋，趙作供時大部分時間望向身旁傳譯主任的電腦螢幕。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ylUQ8tU.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（6日）踏入審訊第39天。時任民主動力召集人趙家賢繼續作供，提及兩辦譴責初選或違法後，戴耀廷嘗試「力挽狂瀾」將各人拉回紅線內，惟抗爭派卻在沒有知會大會下，召開記者會表明否決預算案、望引致國際制裁，是「完全地失控」、「踩界」和抵觸《國安法》，令他覺得要立即退出初選。趙又指，民主動力在提名表格加入承諾擁護《基本法》及效忠特區的條款，因知道這是民選公職人員「應有之義」，惟抗爭派言論絕對不合乎該條款；而趙只是「服務提供者」，非如選委會般有實權，「我唔能夠DQ佢哋嘅話，我唯有喺呢個時候DQ自己」，「比公眾傳媒好清楚認知係一個切割」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，趙家賢透露民主動力原定會委託香港民研進行選前民調，惟因已退出初選，故沒有繼續。他並透露，眾籌所得的大額款項部分納為民主動力經費，而戴耀廷曾表示望預留80至100萬元予香港民研研發新的民間投票系統，民主動力並將剩餘資金捐予香港民研和慈善機構。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指區諾軒致電稱將退出初選-並指趙要自行解散&quot;&gt;趙指區諾軒致電稱將退出初選 並指趙要自行解散&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今就趙家賢退出初選的情況發問。趙家賢表示，區諾軒在7月14日曾致電他指「佢自己將會退出初選，而佢都想我一齊退出」，並指已聯絡時任政制及內地事務局政治助理吳璟儁；而由於建制派傳媒、中央駐港機構、及國務院均大肆抨擊初選涉違《國安法》，區表示根據其判斷及獲得的意見，是需要將初選停止。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙指他當時問區，「初選都做咗出嚟、已經投咗票，我哋有啲咩補救措施、remedies可以做呢？」，區指唯有作為主辦機構的他，及作為承辦機構的民主動力，「要自行解散（初選）」，亦表示自己將於7月15日宣布退出，趙則稱待區退出後，民主動力會一同退出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱退出初選因事情已由本地政治層面提升到國家層面&quot;&gt;趙稱退出初選因事情已由本地政治層面提升到國家層面&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢其後於7月16日在Facebook發出「初選完成：退出參與協調工作聲明」，表示：「本人擔任召集人的民主動力獲主導民主派協調工作的戴耀廷副教授及區諾軒前議員委託承辦『民主派35+公民投票（初選）』，最終結果已公布，本人的協作角色已告完成。經慎重考慮各方意見，為對身邊人士、民主動力執委會及所屬組織等負責，本人現宣佈退出參與本屆立法會選舉的協調工作。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪問趙為何退出，趙表示於7月13日晚得知戴耀廷對初選是否完全合法開始有疑問，而翌日《蘋果日報》政治版資深記者提醒他戴〈真攬炒十步〉一文並著他小心，區諾軒亦表示會退出「35+」，再加上建制陣營與中央政府對初選的看法，趙強調：「我會睇到個事情已經係由香港本地政治層面，提升到去國家嘅層面」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱戴耀廷力挽狂瀾望初選免踩紅線-惟抗爭派召記者會完全失控&quot;&gt;趙稱戴耀廷力挽狂瀾望初選免踩紅線 惟抗爭派召記者會「完全失控」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，7月14日戴耀廷曾向所有參選人發訊息稱「不提否決每一個議案，也不說癱瘓政府」，趙認為此舉除了是統一口徑外，「佢（戴耀廷）都可以講係力挽狂瀾，希望將初選拉返唔好踩到呢個紅線」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過，他指縱使本土抗爭派收到戴的訊息，仍然在「冇同我哋大會有任何溝通嘅時候」，自行於7月15日召開抗爭派記者會，「佢哋不單止無視咗戴耀廷7月14號統一口徑嘅短訊，更加係重複好重視除咗會否決財政預算案，仲會係所有議案都會否決」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙指事前沒有收到通知會有該記者會，強調該記者會與民主動力「完全冇任何嘅關係」。趙認為，抗爭派的發言是希望迫使政府考慮DQ議員和解散立法會，「從而係去到國際層面令到國際關注，而去制裁中央政府」，並加重語氣指：「整件事係完全地失控！」，鄒家成和在延伸庭的黃之鋒聞後不禁發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指抗爭派發言與國安法踩界-他無權dq他們唯有dq自己&quot;&gt;趙指抗爭派發言與《國安法》踩界 他無權DQ他們「唯有DQ自己」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，他特別在民主動力準備的提名表格上，加上參選人要承諾擁護《基本法》及效忠香港特別行政區的條款，明言「呢個係我哋民主動力好清楚知道，擔任民選公職人員嘅應有之義」，黃之鋒再次發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟趙指，抗爭派的發言「絕對不合乎」上述條款，「喺我嘅角度，絕對係同《國安法》係踩界㗎喇！」但他無奈表示，初選只是民間選舉，「我唔係真係好似時任選委會主席同法官咁有個實權」，再加上他只是一個「服務提供者」，「我唔能夠DQ佢哋嘅話，我唯有喺呢個時候DQ自己」，鄒家成發笑，在延伸庭的被告聞後亦大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱原定初選投票後委託香港民研做民意調查-同意民調屬35計劃重要部分&quot;&gt;趙稱原定初選投票後委託香港民研做民意調查 同意民調屬「35+計劃」重要部分&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續解釋，若選舉繼續正常進行，初選後原定有一些協調工作要處理，包括由區諾軒及戴耀廷兩位協調人負責協調勝出參選人的出選名單；而官方投票前的一星期，原定由民主動力委託香港民意研究所進行選前民意調查。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;但趙指，由於區諾軒致電他時提及《國安法》第33條（自動放棄犯罪可減刑的條文），並建議他終止計劃，加上初選結果已公布，「喺呢方面都冇得去做任何補救措施，咁所以我只可以公開簡單講，話個協作角色已經完成啦」。法官陳仲衡問到，事實上民主動力仍有工作要做？趙回應：「喺正常情況底下，根據當時計劃，係仲有嘢要做。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問到，若趙家賢沒有退出協調工作，香港民研的民意調查是否「35+計劃」一個重要而不可少（integral）的部分？趙同意，指以往選前民調只是以滾動形式讓市民每周得知支持度趨勢，而是次民調計劃在選前一星期公布結果，部分選區會視乎支持度來決定最後出選名單，亦可按形勢「指示」各區如何分配選票，形容「有一定作用」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱退出後無付錢予民研做民調-部分眾籌資金作為民動經費部分捐民研及慈善機構&quot;&gt;趙稱退出後無付錢予民研做民調 部分眾籌資金作為民動經費、部分捐民研及慈善機構&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;戴耀廷在趙退出後同日，亦發文宣布「因過去幾個月的勞累，我希望在未來的一段日子，爭取多一些休息時間，也可以更專注於學術的工作。當然，我不是甚麼也不再做，我必會與所有認同民主普選的香港人走在一起，在各自的位置，為達成這目標，繼續努力，直至民主普選臨到香港」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙表示，戴發文前他「完全冇收到任何訊息」，當日亦沒有與戴討論其帖文或「35+計劃」。但趙記得之後約一星期，戴有問他是否仍會付錢予香港民研鍾庭耀進行選前民調，趙回應「我哋民主動力已經退出，就唔想繼續之後嘅事情，所以就冇畀錢」。趙續指，戴在官方選舉提名期結束、宣布延期前，亦曾向他發訊息指香港民研或會另外找資源做有關民意調查，至於之後民研會否有就「35+」的工作，趙沒有仔細問下去。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰追問眾籌資金有何去向，趙表示每個細項少於1,000元的資金才會撥入初選開支，其餘則會視作捐予民主動力的會務經費，及支持民意調查的資金。趙指，戴耀廷曾提及望撥出80至100萬予香港民研，指民主派對反對預算案有顧慮，望能研發新的民間投票系統。趙在其後執委會會議上，建議將餘下資金部分捐予香港民研用作民意調查，但沒指定某一項目；至於其他資金則再捐助予一些根據《稅務條例》88條註冊的慈善機構。趙指於2020年8月底至9月捐款予民研。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡亦問到，趙的帖文兩度使用「本人」一詞，他是否以個人名義、而非民主動力的名義退出？趙指根據民主動力執委會的章程，他作為召集人，「係整體領導成個組織嘅工作」，早前執委會亦清楚他代表民主動力承辦整個初選的工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙原打算區諾軒退出後視乎情況決定何時退出-惟抗爭派記者會後思維轉變要清楚切割&quot;&gt;趙原打算區諾軒退出後視乎情況決定何時退出 惟抗爭派記者會後思維轉變要清楚「切割」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰其後主動提及，趙宣布退出協調工作的前一日，曾轉發區諾軒宣布退出的帖文，並提到「在恐懼瀰漫的氛圍，會謹守崗位，堅持合法實務工作」。李問趙前一日已知道區諾軒會退出，但似乎他在15日仍希望繼續初選工作，那為何到了16日又宣布退出？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙解釋，7月14日與區諾軒通話時，「當時我哋傾好係佢首先退出，而我會再睇住個事情，睇吓邊個位合適而作出退出」，並指因始終有行政工作要處理，而平時就初選的論述和回應傳媒，均是由計劃的「倡導、領導者」戴耀廷處理，故當時認為可以「再睇幾日」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，其思維「好特別嘅轉變」，就是在7月15日「完全冇認知、冇提示」下，本土抗爭派召開記者會，重申他們的發言絕對不合乎擁護《基本法》和效忠特區的條款。趙再強調，「整件事已經係完全失控」，指他們「仲要係以初選勝出者去講明，會好貫徹地就住戴耀廷協調嘅共識，去繼續行落去同參選」。趙強調，他作為民主動力召集人，「我對我嘅組織同埋身邊嘅同事等等係要負責」，「咁我只可以喺當時就係好清楚嘅要退出之後嘅工作，畀公眾傳媒好清楚認知係一個切割」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱作為有恆常思維的人-認為抗爭派提及的行動會抵觸國安法故退出初選&quot;&gt;趙稱作為有「恆常思維」的人 認為抗爭派提及的行動會抵觸《國安法》故退出初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉提議應觀看趙家賢提及的抗爭派記者會片段，李運騰亦指望了解會上各人實際說過的話。控方下午播放長約1小時的抗爭派記者會片段，播畢後主控萬德豪問趙家賢，記者會與他指「思維轉變」有否關係。趙指「有好重要嘅關係」，指看到記者會直播「就令到我會覺得係即刻要去退出（初選）」，並指退出聲明其實於15日晚已準備好，但他曾與一些團體討論過「出Facebook最有利嘅時候，就係朝頭早11點左右」，故最終於翌日該時段發帖。在延伸庭的袁嘉蔚及黃之鋒不禁竊笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉打斷指控方問題是記者會上有什麼令趙改變心意。趙續表示，記者會上抗爭派曾表達抗爭派已成為主流，會將抗爭意志繼續帶入議會進行「攬炒」，進行肢體衝突或對議案投下否決票；亦提及政府可能會DQ本土派候選人或立法會議員，他們會否決預算案迫使特首解散立會。趙續指，會上提及國際社會留意到事態發展就會「圍堵中共」，亦提及美國有簽署法案制裁中國與香港的官員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙再次強調，聽到記者會內容時「好確知」抗爭派聲稱的行動並非能捍衞基本法和效忠特區的「心意」，亦認為他們提到的流程會抵觸《國安法》。趙補充他當然並非法律學者或有關方面的律師專家，只是作為有「恆常思維」的人士、一個「合理的人（reasonable man）」而有上述看法，並認為代表民主動力籌辦初選，一定要對組織和身邊人負責，故當時「好清楚知道要即刻係去退出（初選）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱戴曾提及國安法生效後參與者言行或對計劃產生影響-指有人有啲過咗界&quot;&gt;趙稱戴曾提及《國安法》生效後參與者言行或對計劃產生影響 指有人「有啲過咗界」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙又補充，區諾軒曾向他提及《國安法》第33條要用方法終止初選計劃，而他在抗爭派記者會前一日，亦意識到初選協調整個「活動項目」已變成戴耀廷「攬炒十步」的一部分。趙續指，戴7月14日發訊息「諗住力挽狂瀾將大家嘅言行統一」、「將大家由踩到紅線拉返出嚟嘅時候」，抗爭派卻「清楚講明我哋而家喺紅線裡面呀」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，趙不止一次稱戴想把大家從紅線拉出來，是戴親口告訴他，抑或趙猜測戴的意圖？趙指戴發訊息當日，二人曾以電話聯絡，戴提及當時有候選人的言論「已經有啲過咗界」，《文匯》、《大公》等建制媒體亦有報導。趙指戴當時認為普通法沒有追溯力，故不認為他以往的文章有問題；但《國安法》生效後，所有初選參與者的言行便可能對整個計劃有不同程度的影響，故戴望發訊息做到「統一口徑」，趙並意識到戴「其實想將整件事係由踩到界拉返出嚟」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙在法官追問下確認，《國安法》前戴耀廷均稱「35+計劃」合法，直至7月13日晚趙首次聽到戴不確定初選是否違法。李續問，趙看到抗爭派記者會後感到憂慮，有否與戴耀廷討論會上內容？趙指沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問確認書意思-趙稱屬行政措施最終由選舉主任決定能否入閘&quot;&gt;官問「確認書」意思 趙稱屬行政措施、最終由選舉主任決定能否入閘&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，李運騰亦指記者會上屢聽到抗爭派被問及會否簽「確認書」，問「確認書」是什麼。趙指現行選舉法例沒有列明要簽署確認書，確認書應是在2019年區議會選舉始出現，並將法例要求候選人作出聲明的條款，如列出某些《基本法》條文，要求獲提名人士再次確認簽署。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙指初選提名表格並不包括確認書內容，因已參考官方選舉表格，而擁護《基本法》條款亦包含所有《基本法》條文和附件；而抗爭派當時是關注確認書會否要求擁護《國安法》。趙並指，2019年區選時有候選人沒有簽確認書但能入閘，有候選人有簽但不能入閘，故確認書只是「行政措施」，「最終都應該係由個選舉主任決定嗰個人係能唔能夠入閘」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下周二（11日）續審。臨散庭前，控方表示已就其中一名控方證人申請匿名令，若辯方有反對望於下周三前提出。&lt;/p&gt;
